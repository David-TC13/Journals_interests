"Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases - People's Daily Online","Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases (Xinhua) 12:07, March 11, 2023BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing ""two sessions"" in Beijing hold great significance not only for China´s own development but also for other nations interested in understanding China´s future growth trajectory and global impact.The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual sessions of China´s National People´s Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which are the country´s top legislature and national political advisory body, respectively.China´s opening-up policy remains one of the most discussed topics at the political event this year. The government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation demonstrates the steady progress and China´s impressive determination on the policy, saying that ""We remained committed to opening up wider to the world and expanded international economic and trade cooperation to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes.""As an Egyptian living in China for years, I have witnessed the country´s wider opening-up pursuit, and I believe an open China is vital to the struggling global economic recovery.STORIES BEHIND ""THINNER"" SUITCASESI have friends of different nationalities who share the same feeling that our suitcases are ""thinner"" these days when returning to China from holidays. Over a decade ago, my family would always stuff my suitcase with cheese, dates, spices and other local specialties before I returned to China.Now, however, more global products are entering the Chinese market through platforms such as the China International Import Expo (CIIE). With Arab specialties including Egyptian oranges, dates from the United Arab Emirates and essential oils from Syria easily available in Chinese supermarkets, I no longer need to carry these things all the way to China.According to the government work report, China developed new forms of foreign trade over the past five years and built 152 new integrated pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce. Major trade events such as CIIE, the China Import and Export Fair, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the China International Consumer Products Expo have delivered positive results.Furthermore, China simplified customs clearance procedures and reduced the clearance time for imports and exports by 67 percent and 92 percent, respectively, bringing about a significant reduction in related compliance costs, the work report added.Amidst the growing trend of trade protectionism and the so-called ""decoupling and severing industrial and supply chains"" by some developed countries, China´s efforts toward trade liberalization and facilitation have become increasingly crucial.With an enormous market of more than 1.4 billion people, China is the world´s largest goods trader, a major trading partner of over 140 countries and regions, and has the world´s second-largest consumer market and import market. There is no doubt that China is a key hub of the global economic cycle, benefiting the entire world with the dividends of its super-sized market.STRONG MAGNET FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT""Intensifying efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment,"" as stated in the government work report, is one of the key priorities of the Chinese government´s economic work in 2023.During my over a decade-long experience of living in China, I have seen an increasing number of international companies investing in the country. When enterprises first entered China, most of them just regarded it as the ""factory of the world."" But later many of these companies set up research and development centers here to continuously increase the added value of their industrial chains.In 2022, foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 8 percent year on year to 189.13 billion U.S. dollars, reinforcing its status as a magnet for foreign investors.Among Arab countries, Gulf countries' investment in China is particularly eye-catching. Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Kuwait National Petroleum Company and other energy giants have carried out in-depth investment cooperation with many Chinese provinces and enterprises.China and Arab countries have adhered to pursuing mutual benefits, promoted trade and investment facilitation, and multiplied the growth of mutual investment and economic and trade cooperation, according to the Saudi Arabian newspaper Alriyadh.The sovereign wealth funds of Gulf states have long been mainly invested in developed markets in Europe and the United States. In recent years, as China-Arab relations have continued to improve and their economic ties deepened, China´s market and assets are gradually favored by sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.In 2018, Abu Dhabi Global Market, an international financial center in Abu Dhabi, opened its first overseas representative office in Beijing.Ajlan &Bros Holding Group, a leading investment holding company in the Middle East and one of the largest private enterprises of Saudi Arabia in China, has been doing business in China for more than 20 years. With the increasingly close economic and trade exchanges between China and Saudi Arabia, the company has set up four investment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong since 2017.Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) has jumped onto the bandwagon of China´s green development. The company announced a carbon-neutral strategy and plans to actively expand investment cooperation in China.""We need to 'join hands' with each other instead of 'letting go' of each other´s hands. We need to 'tear down walls,' not 'erect walls.'"" I was deeply impressed by these inspiring words by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and I believe China walks its talk.A sentence in the government work report fully expresses China´s confidence in attracting more foreign investment, saying that with a vast and open market, China is sure to provide even greater business opportunities for foreign companies in China.MORE FRIENDS, MORE CHANCESThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has attracted more than three-quarters of the world´s countries and 32 international organizations.Over the past decade, Chinese companies have invested 397.9 billion yuan (about 57 billion U.S. dollars) in cooperation zones built in countries along the Belt and Road, creating 421,000 local jobs.The BRI has made significant contributions to Egypt´s modernization process and a notable example is the country´s new administrative capital.A modern city is taking shape in the desert east of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. Constructed by a Chinese company, the Central Business District (CBD) in Egypt´s new administrative capital boasts the tallest building in Africa, standing at 385.8 meters.This achievement is a testament to the growing friendship between Egypt and China. The project is nearing completion within just over four years. According to Egypt´s Al-Ahram newspaper, ""China speed"" makes Egypt´s dream come true.From material selection to the application of technologies, the project embodies the concept of green development and can help Cairo effectively deal with air pollution and other ""big city diseases.""The CBD in Egypt´s new administrative capital has become a popular spot, bustling with visitors. I would go there every time I go back to Egypt.The outcomes of high-quality BRI development are spread across Africa. I have experienced the Chinese-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway. From the station to the trains, I was struck by the modern scene around me. Passengers were enjoying the convenience and efficiency of the self-service ticket vending machines, while the crew provided excellent services.China´s high-level opening-up has been a continuous success, and the BRI has become an international public good and a platform for international cooperation, Karim Adel, head of the Cairo-based Al Adl Center for Economic and Strategic Studies, told Xinhua.China´s other initiatives, especially the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, have also won the support of many countries, Adel added.Last year, I had the privilege of participating in the translation and review work of the Arabic version of the fourth volume of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China."" With every word I read, I gained a deeper appreciation for the thoughts of the Chinese leader.In 2021, Xi said that on the road to the well-being of all humankind, no country or nation should be left behind. All countries and nations are equally entitled to development opportunities and rights to development, Xi said at the Communist Party of China and World Political Parties Summit. His words deeply touched me.There is an Arabic proverb that goes, ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together,"" just like how in China people often say ""more friends, more chances.""China is a country committed to high-level opening-up and I firmly believe that its efforts will bring more concrete opportunities to the world. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220517.html,11,3,2023
Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? - People's Daily Online,"Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? (Xinhua) 11:01, March 11, 2023-- ""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.-- China always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.-- The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For a long time in history, the world was shrouded in the myth that modernization equals Westernization. The emergence of Chinese modernization dispels it, making modernization no longer a single-choice question, but a multiple-choice one.For the world, China´s task to modernize a country of 1.4 billion people, or nearly one-fifth of the global population, is unprecedented. The Herculean pursuit not only captures global attention, but also has global ramifications.Among a series of concepts and initiatives that China promotes in both state governance and global interactions, the Chinese path to modernization is the most popular keyword that people would like to know more about, according to an overseas survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency recently.WHAT ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHINESE AND WESTERN MODERNIZATION?China´s path to modernization is one of peace and development, win-win cooperation, and harmony between humanity and nature, rather than external expansion and plundering.""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.""The modernization of a small number of Western countries was based on the exploitation, oppression and colonization of almost the entire world. China is not developing by exploiting any other country; China is developing itself and modernizing itself, and at the same time helping other countries to develop and modernize,"" he said.China does not seek to exploit or control other nations, and it plays no role in inciting conflicts, said Mokhtar Gobashy, deputy chairman of the Cairo-based Arab Center for Political and Strategic Studies, adding that´s why China has gained respect and popularity in the Arab world.Meanwhile, Chinese modernization emphasizes both material and cultural-ethical advancement, which distinguishes it from Western modernization, said Chen Gang, assistant director of the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore.The coordination of material and cultural-ethical advancement leads the way to realize all-around material abundance as well as people´s well-rounded development, Chen said.WHAT CHINESE MODERNIZATION CAN OFFER FOR THE WORLD?China stands in the world as the second-largest economy and a responsible major country. It always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.Firstly, China is committed to making the world less poor and more equitable.By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.Commenting on China´s poverty reduction drive, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said those achievements are ""the biggest contribution for dramatical reduction of poverty.""More than eradicating absolute poverty, Chinese modernization promotes common prosperity, thereby shrinking the enormous wealth gap and inequality that have risen in tandem with Western modernization.British scholar and political commentator Martin Jacques highlighted China´s pursuit of common prosperity, lamenting how Western countries have never taken it seriously.""For China to embrace common prosperity, to establish a society of greater fairness, greater equity, that is a very important message not only to China, Chinese people but to the world as well,"" he said.China, on its way toward modernization, has also been sharing its development dividends with the rest of the world.Take the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to a World Bank forecast, if all Belt and Road transport infrastructure projects are carried out, the initiative would generate 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars of global revenues annually to 2030. Up to 90 percent of the revenues would go to partner countries.""The most important thing about the BRI is that developing nations could benefit from the great experience in the development of China. BRI gives them the opportunity to create an industrial society and join the modern age. This is something that in the long run would bode well for the future of humanity,"" said Khairy Tourk, professor of economics with the Stuart School of Business at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.Secondly, China is committed to making the world greener and more biodiverse.China ranks first globally in the area of planted forests and forest coverage growth, contributing a quarter of the world´s new forest area in the past decade.From 2012 to 2021, China´s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP declined by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal.So far, China has also emerged as a major proponent of renewable energy, and it is working hard to capitalize on the potential of a green BRI.UNFCCC (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Executive Secretary Simon Stiell spoke highly of China´s firm and consistent stance on actively addressing climate change, as well as its efforts to translate climate commitments into concrete actions.At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis, China continues to make solid progress in dealing with climate change and plays an important role in advancing the global response to climate change, Stiell said.Meanwhile, under China´s presidency, the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the global biodiversity framework ahead of schedule. China has shown leadership in global biodiversity protection, Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, has said.Thirdly, China is committed to making the world more peaceful.For more than 70 years, China has never started a war, never occupied a single square mile of foreign territory, never engaged in proxy wars, and never been a member of or organized any military bloc.It is the only country that has incorporated peaceful development in its Constitution, and the only country among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge no first use of nuclear weapons. China´s track record on peace can stand the scrutiny of history, and its peaceful rise is an unprecedented miracle in human history.Since China´s restoration of its lawful seat at the United Nations in 1971, China has actively participated in the political settlement of major regional hot issues, including the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and the Palestine-Israel issue.In response to mounting conflicts and security challenges in today´s world, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022.And in the GSI Concept Paper released last month, China further expounded the core ideas and principles of the initiative, identified the priorities, platforms and mechanisms of cooperation and demonstrated China´s sense of responsibility for safeguarding world peace and firm resolve to defend global security.""China´s idea of being a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods are consistent with the ideals of the UN Charter,"" former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said.People visit Jianchang ancient city during the Spring Festival holiday in Xichang, southwest China´s Sichuan Province, on Jan. 27, 2023. (Photo by Li Jieyi/Xinhua)AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH?Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization,"" presents another picture of modernization, expands the channels for developing countries to achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity, Xi once said.China´s rise as a global economic power shattered the long-held notion that modernization means Westernization, said David Monyae, director of the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg.The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.""They could find in this model elements for the construction of a development path that can enable them to handle present and future challenges,"" he said.""Modernization has never been simply Westernization,"" Chen said, adding that ""Chinese modernization is a new development model, which can be used as a reference for other countries with similar national conditions or at a similar stage of development."" ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220417.html,11,3,2023
UN urged to intervene over destruction of U.S. abortion rights: The Guardian - People's Daily Online,"UN urged to intervene over destruction of U.S. abortion rights: The Guardian (Xinhua) 13:40, March 04, 2023LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Top human rights organizations are calling on the United Nations to intervene over the destruction of abortion rights in the United States, The Guardian reported on Thursday.In a letter shared in advance with The Guardian and sent on Thursday by nearly 200 organizations and experts, the authors detail how, since the overturning of the federal constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, some 22 million women and girls of reproductive age live in states where abortion access is now either banned or inaccessible.Abortion restrictions, the signatories write, deny ""women´s decisional and bodily autonomy in a way that rejects the agency, dignity and equality of people who can become pregnant.""The groups in the letter claim that overturning the constitutional right to abortion contravenes the U.S.´s international obligations as a UN member organization, according to The Guardian.""The U.S. must be castigated on the world stage for its treatment of women, girls and others who can become pregnant -- the scale and intensity of human rights violations that the U.S. is inflicting on its population are near unfathomable at this point,"" said Christine Ryan, legal director of the Global Justice Center, one of the signatories in a phone interview with The Guardian.The authors say the curtailment of abortion rights in the United States is of a piece with the country´s history of devaluing the lives of Black women, who are hit worst by abortion restrictions, it said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10216056.html,04,3,2023

Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 accounts for nearly 90 pct new COVID-19 cases in U.S. - People's Daily Online,"Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 accounts for nearly 90 pct new COVID-19 cases in U.S. (Xinhua) 13:38, March 04, 2023LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The highly transmissible Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 now accounts for nearly 90 percent of all COVID-19 cases reported in the United States, according to the latest estimates released Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The prevalence of XBB.1.5 has kept increasing since late last year, and it is estimated to account for 89.2 percent of new COVID-19 cases in the country this week, up from 85.4 percent last week and 79.7 percent two weeks prior.The second most prevalent strain BQ.1.1 accounts for 6.7 percent.The CDC first started tracking XBB.1.5 in November last year, when it accounted for less than 1 percent of cases nationwide. Since then, the strain is spreading quickly in the United States.Early study suggests XBB.1.5 has a couple of concerning mutations that suggest it is even more contagious than other strains, possibly the most transmissible one so far.While XBB.1.5 is spreading easier, scientists said it does not seem to cause more severe disease.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10216052.html,04,3,2023
Commentary: Competition should not be the leitmotif of China-U.S. ties - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: Competition should not be the leitmotif of China-U.S. tiesBy Xinhua writer Guo Yage (Xinhua) 13:48, February 18, 2023BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Five times did U.S. President Joe Biden name ""China"" in his second State of the Union address on Tuesday night, more than any other countries or regions beyond the United States.That has indeed shed some light on how much weight Washington gives to its relationship with Beijing. Yet the way the U.S. leader tried to define U.S.-China ties, coupled with the U.S. administration´s recent melodramatic handling of the Chinese weather balloon incident, has added to the world´s worries about a much troubled bilateral relationship that bears heavily not only on both countries but the larger world as well.""We seek competition,"" ""to compete with China,"" ""winning the competition"" -- in such a pugnacious narrative, China seems to be put into a zero-sum game where the United States must and will come out as the only victor.In recent years, the anxieties over an ever-stronger China in Washington are mounting -- in their eyes, a steadily growing China increasingly intolerable, and its global supremacy threatened.Despite that the current U.S. administration has repeatedly pledged that the United States respects China´s system, does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, and that it has no intention to have a conflict with China or to contain China, what it has done is pointing the opposite way.To contain China, Washington has exerted almost each and every element of its toolbox, be it smearing campaigns, sanctions or bloc politics. It peddled lies about China´s human rights records, anti-pandemic fight and rightful development, and defamed its domestic and foreign policies, to fan the flames of hostility towards Beijing; it imposed unjustified bans on Chinese tech firms and individuals, to maintain cyber and economic hegemony; it is trying to tie other countries to its China-bashing chariot, and building up the so-called Indo-Pacific encirclement around China.Guided by its own version of ""America First"" doctrine, the Biden administration signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act in last August.The act is designed to ""lower costs, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and counter China,"" according to a fact sheet on the official website of the White House. Almost six months later, the administration moved further to halt U.S. exports to Chinese tech giant Huawei, ignoring the hazards the decision will inflict on global industrial and supply chains.In an attempt to pressure Africa to counter so-called ""China´s influence,"" top U.S. officials peddled the ""debt trap"" conspiracy again during their Africa tour, giving no concern for the welfare of the continent.In 1972, China and the United States issued the Shanghai Communique, acknowledging a key consensual willingness for the two sides to seek common ground while shelving their differences, and laying a political foundation for the development of bilateral ties. Over the years, big names from both sides have reiterated their calls for more and better bilateral cooperation.Over the decades, cooperation in various sectors has generated great benefits for both the Chinese and American people. And despite bilateral tensions and decoupling rhetoric, goods trade between the two countries hit a record 690.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, according to newly released U.S. official data.Unfortunately, Washington is drifting away from the broadly acknowledged consensus on cooperation. The sweetness of healthy competition has soured, and the word ""competition"" has become a synonym for confrontation.As former U.S. trade official William Reinsch was quoted as saying by The Economist in its opinion published in mid-January, Washington has moved from a ""run faster"" to a ""run faster and trip the other guy"" policy, nothing of the sort a responsible major country would ever do.China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Their respective success constitutes opportunities rather than challenges to each other, and the world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together.For the benefit of all, Washington needs to acknowledge this truth about arguably the world´s most important bilateral ties, dump the logic of a zero-sum game, and ditch its hostile China policy, be it on the pretext of ""competition"" or else.It takes political wisdom and good judgment to see the bigger picture of China-U.S. relations, in which cooperation stands as the leitmotif.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209584.html,18,2,2023
To ensure that the global economy grows on right track - People's Daily Online,"To ensure that the global economy grows on right trackBy Huan Yuping (People´s Daily) 13:58, February 18, 2023Recent reports issued by the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other organizations pointed out that the world economy will face greater downward pressure and increasing risks of recession because of the tightened monetary policies adopted by major economies such as the United States and Europe, geopolitical intentions, and continuous food and energy crises.Faced with challenges, the international society is in urgent need to improve the effectiveness of global economic governance. In particular, major economies should enhance macroeconomic policy coordination, jointly contribute to safeguarding an open world economy and make concerted efforts to maintain long-term and stable economic development in the post-pandemic era.To balance inflation control and stabilizing growth is a prominent challenge facing the world economy this year.Some reports believe that high inflation, which has bothered developed economies, is not likely to be completely coming down this year, so these economies' will keep tightening their monetary policies, which increases the risk of economic recession.The IMF attributed the possible slowing growth this year to advanced economies, whose growth is projected to decline from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.2 percent in 2023.Advanced economies' maintaining deflation would create negative spillover effects, which might bring higher debt and financial risks to emerging markets and developing countries.Growing trend of unilateralism and protectionist policies adopted by a few countries remain another major challenge facing the world economy.For political purposes, a few major countries that are of huge influence over the world economy, have long followed irresponsible policies and measures that are against the market law and hinder cooperation and development. It triggered concerns from the international community that the world economy, which is in sluggish recovery, may face higher risks if such practice continues.A severe fragmentation of the global economy after decades of increasing economic integration could reduce global economic output by up to 7 percent, but the losses could reach 8-12 percent in some countries, if technology is also decoupled, the International Monetary Fund said in a new staff report.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva noted that economic integration has helped billions of people become wealthier, healthier, and better educated. ""This peace and cooperation dividend should not be squandered"".Modern history reminds the world that major countries should practically take their responsibilities and enhance mutual coordination, which is of vital importance for the world economy to maintain stable progress amidst raging torrents.At present, it is widely expected around the world that a few major countries should reclaim their sense of responsibility and play a constructive role in promoting the strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy.The world economy has come to a crossroads. Only through enhanced coordination and cooperation can its anti-risk capability be raised.It´s important to see that this round of inflation has multiple reasons. Apart from the supply-side factors, the world needs to enhance international cooperation, address both the supply and demand sides, fix industrial and supply chains and pay close attention to energy and food security.While controlling inflation, advanced economies should work to reduce the negative spillover effects caused by their adjustment in monetary policies and practically safeguard the stability of the international financial system.Building an open world economy serves the common interests of the international society. All parties should build consensus and make joint efforts. Major countries, in particular, should maintain the stability of the global economic system, rules and foundation with concrete actions, rather than taking the lead to hinder international economic cooperation or divide global economy.Crises and opportunities always emerged simultaneously in the history of world economy.While effectively coping with risks, countries should take active and appropriate management measures to release more benefits of economic globalization and to rebalance the process of economic globalization.They should focus more on development issues, jointly work to make global development more inclusive, beneficial to all and resilient, and accelerate the implementation of UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.They should also strengthen international cooperation on tackling climate change and push for a comprehensive green transition in economic and social development.As the world´s largest economy, China is picking up speed in its own economic recovery and committed to improving global economic governance. The country will keep injecting confidence and positive energy into global economic development.The historical trend of openness and development will not reverse course, and the world´s shared desire to meet challenges together through cooperation will remain as strong as ever.All parties should join hands with each other and proceed with confidence, so as to ensure that the global economy grows on the right track.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209587.html,18,2,2023

China-U.S. relations should not be led astray by a wandering balloon: Chinese envoy - People's Daily Online,"China-U.S. relations should not be led astray by a wandering balloon: Chinese envoy (Xinhua) 16:21, February 18, 2023WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy said Friday that Washington´s response to a Chinese unmanned civilian airship unexpectedly entering U.S. airspace was an overreaction, urging the U.S. side not to let bilateral relations go astray as a result of this isolated incident.Xu Xueyuan, charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an opinion essay published in The Washington Post that China has informed the United States of the nature of the incident -- that the airship was used for meteorological research and unintentionally entered U.S. airspace, and that it had limited self-steering capability -- ""after earnest verification and in the shortest possible time. We have asked that the situation be handled in a calm, professional and quiet manner.""The overreaction by America to shoot down the airship despite the fact that it posed no real security threat -- and its moves to heighten the issue, including alleging that China has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program targeting the world and illegally imposing sanctions on six Chinese companies and institutions -- have exacerbated the situation, Xu said. ""This isolated incident has caused new wounds in China-U.S. relations.""""The bilateral relationship is the world´s most important and complex. Relations between the two nations have never been smooth sailing but have included a process of overcoming problems whenever they occur. Many of the issues between the two countries originate from strategic misperception and misjudgment. The difficulty caused by the airship´s accidental entrance in U.S. airspace is yet another example,"" she said.""But problems are not to be feared,"" Xu said. ""What matters is good faith and the ability to resolve them.""""This bilateral relationship requires a 'whole-process' approach and attention to the bigger picture. What, then, is that bigger picture? It is the fact that the two countries have many more common interests than differences; it is the common understanding that a sound and stable China-U.S. relationship is fundamentally good for the two countries and people worldwide,"" she said.""When the China-U.S. relationship enters a difficult patch, we must show the courage and wisdom to respect facts and return to reason. Sensational and politically driven moves harm everyone. By handling this balloon incident properly, China and the U.S. would prove to their people, and the world, that they can respect each other and act responsibly to manage differences and avoid confrontation,"" Xu said.""China stands for more dialogue between the two countries at all levels. This has been an important understanding reached between President Xi Jinping and President Biden at their Bali meeting three months ago ... China and the United States both gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,"" she said.""We sincerely hope that the United States will work with China and not allow a wandering balloon to lead the bilateral relationship astray. We look forward to concrete steps to prevent the situation from going further down the wrong path, so that the China-U.S. relationship can return to a track of sound and stable development,"" Xu said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209604.html,18,2,2023

Human rights protection is a pretense of the U.S., which covers a ""black hole"" of the human rights situation in the U.S.The U.S. Department of Labor announced that it found that Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI), one of the nation’s largest food safety sanitation services providers, employed over 100 children in hazardous occupations, and had them working overnight shifts at meat processing facilities. The minors were working with hazardous chemicals and cleaning meat processing equipment, and suffered injuries while working for PSSI.Child labor is a chronic illness of U.S. society. The country has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child yet, and has been criticized by the International Labor Organization many times. The Guardian reported that child labor law violations have increased in the U.S., with a 37 percent increase in fiscal year 2022, including 688 children working in hazardous conditions. Estimates by the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs suggest that there are 500,000 to 800,000 child farmworkers in the U.S. These facts are a sharp reminder that the U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, can hardly protect the legitimate rights of children. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10220276.html,10,3,2023

Interview: China's path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China´s path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist (Xinhua) 11:56, March 11, 2023LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China has blazed a path to modernization that suits its society and harmonizes with the environment, a renowned British sociologist has said.""There are two things (about the Chinese path to modernization) which stand out for me: the scale of the task with such a large population on one side, harmony with nature on the other,"" Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.Albrow said that, given the sheer size of China´s population, the amazing pace of its modernization has greatly impressed him.Harmony between humanity and nature is a theme that goes back millennia into Chinese history, the sociologist said. ""It shows that the emphasis China gives to that means that modernization does not discard the past; it adopts the past and carries the past forward.""""Modernization is congruent with the culture of China itself,"" Albrow said.The Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development, he said.Albrow explained that modernization means applying science and technology to human organizations.""On the back of the development of modern technologies, modernization allows countries to take their own culture forward,"" he said. ""Every country is able to develop modernity in the way that suits its own culture.""""China has given an example to the world of how you can have a culturally-led modernization program,"" he added.Albrow, author of the book China and the Shared Human Future: Exploring Common Values and Goals, said that as the world turns its attention to the ongoing ""two sessions"" held in Beijing, it´s important for China to demonstrate that ""democracy comes in many different forms"" and that ""China is moving forward all the time.""The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual meetings of the National People´s Congress, the country´s national legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.""The Chinese version of democracy is one which enlists the support of the whole population, through the efforts of the Communist Party of China to produce a coherent approach to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""China´s form of democracy is an evolving form of discussion and debate, but one which is built upon the consensus of society as a whole.""""It´s a profound kind of democracy and very different from the kinds which exist in so many Western countries, the kinds of democracies that exist, for instance, (in) the United Kingdom or the United States, ones which tend to produce disagreements"" and make it difficult for a country to take any single path into the future, despite its continual debate and discussion about how to go forward, according to Albrow.""Democracy is not a stable condition; democracy is something which is continually moving forward,"" he continued, adding that ""China is in a position now, in this particular 'two sessions', to take us forward again, with well-judged reforms of its own system.""Albrow is confident in the CPC´s resolve to further reforms that will remove institutional obstacles to fulfill Chinese modernization.

Commentary: The post-shame era of U.S. foreign policy - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: The post-shame era of U.S. foreign policy (Xinhua) 13:05, March 04, 2023BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Ethics Committee on Thursday launched an investigation against Congressman George Santos, who has been found to have fabricated major elements of his life story and even lied about his mother´s death in the 9/11 attacks.Not known for aggressively pursuing inquiries, the committee has limited ability to punish lawmakers for wrongdoing. In February, Santos told CNN that he is ""not concerned"" about a House ethics probe. And despite his scandals, Republicans seem reluctant to push for Santos' immediate removal from office.The National Public Radio (NPR) recently lamented that surviving scandals has become easier for politicians like Santos, as the United States has entered an era of ""post-shame politics."" But NPR is a bit slow on the uptake. For people outside the United States, the post-shame era began long ago, particularly in regards to U.S. foreign policy.In his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Samuel P. Huntington noted that the belief in American principles as universal and the U.S. mission to promote and defend these principles throughout the world has been a persistent and potent theme in American foreign policy. However, this theme has become intermittent and weaker as the United States pursues its interests with no sense of shame and a willingness to flout its own principles and values.The ""America First"" policy embodies how times have changed. Championed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, the approach prioritizes U.S. interests over those of other countries. It disregards established international norms, which many have criticized as selfish and isolationist.Sadly, the lack of shame in American foreign policy has persisted beyond Trump´s presidency, as seen in continued U.S. drone strikes, the hasty Afghanistan withdrawal, the theft of Syria oil and its long-arm jurisdiction, to name just a few.The U.S. military´s drone strikes in Somalia and Yemen, among other countries, have been controversial due to their often deadly impact on innocent civilians. Despite the U.S. government´s claims to uphold human rights and the rule of law, the drone strikes have resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of non-combatant deaths. Moreover, the legality of these strikes has been widely questioned, particularly as they were often carried out in countries where the United States was not officially at war and was without the consent of those nations.Since 2001, the U.S. military has conducted several operations in the name of fighting terrorism, resulting in the deaths of over 900,000 individuals, approximately 335,000 of them civilians. These horrific U.S. military campaigns have created 37 million refugees worldwide, with an estimated 48,000 civilians having died due to U.S. airstrikes over the past two decades.A lack of shame was also evident during the abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan, ignoring the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity it had championed. Relying heavily on NATO partners during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the U.S. government suddenly pulled out of the country without sufficient consultation with its allies, leaving them in a complex and precarious position, its allies complained.The U.S. military´s exploitation of Syrian oil resources is another prime example of how America lacks shame. Despite violating international law, the United States and its mercenaries have been accused of extracting an average of 66,000 barrels of oil per day from Syrian oil fields. Such acts of theft have damaged the United States' moral authority and undermined its credibility as a global superpower.Its long-arm jurisdiction also exemplifies a sense of shamelessness. The United States typically enforces its laws on foreign individuals and entities outside its territory, disregarding the sovereignty of other nations. This behavior has been illustrated in cases involving French company Alstom and Chinese company Huawei. In both cases, the United States used its legal and economic prowess to bully others into submission and maintain dominance in key industries while containing rising competitors.The implications of a ""post-shame era"" in U.S. foreign policy extend far beyond the country´s borders. People worldwide associate such shame with the entire nation.To rebuild its reputation, the United States must prioritize collaboration with other countries rather than continue to pursue unilateralism and hegemony. Only then can it play a more constructive and positive role in shaping a safer and more prosperous world.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10216003.html,04,3,2023

It should contribute positively to world peace and stability, instead of merely being a troublemaker,"" Zhang told the Security Council briefing on Ukraine.""I would like to point out that NATO, on the one hand, claims to remain a regional defensive alliance, while on the other hand, constantly seeks to breach its geographic confines and expand its agenda, stoke division and tensions, create fears and confrontations, and keep strengthening military and security ties with Asia Pacific countries,"" said the ambassador.""This is obviously self-contradictory. We note with concern that the NATO secretary general recently made many irresponsible and unfounded remarks on the situation of Asia Pacific,"" Zhang explained.The envoy stressed that the Ukraine crisis is, in essence, the culmination of security conflicts in Europe closely related to NATO´s constant eastern expansion since the Cold War.""Pursuing absolute security and political exclusion and containment by force against a specific party is the very crux of the reason why Europe is in the security plight. If following such a mindset, Europe, and even the whole world will be caught up in greater turmoil,"" he said.""We once again call on Russia and Ukraine to cease fire and start peace negotiations as soon as possible,"" said Zhang.He called on the United States, EU, and NATO to sit down with Russia for a comprehensive and in-depth dialogue.""Based on the principle of security indivisibility, they should discuss how to build a balanced, effective, and sustainable security architecture and realize common security,"" he said.""In this context, every effort should be made to stop any attempt to hype up the conflict and to avoid its escalation and expansion,"" the envoy added.Zhang underscored the importance of strictly complying with international treaties and the implementation of legal obligations in good faith, noting that they are the basic requirements of the rule of law.""This is what practicing true multilateralism is about. Regrettably, when it comes to negotiated agreements that failed to be implemented, the Minsk Agreement is not the only case. The Paris Agreement on climate change faces major setbacks because of the withdrawal of one key party,"" he said.The JCPOA, or the Iran nuclear deal, has yet to be revived, he said. ""Some major bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements are now being withdrawn from, violated, hollowed out, and weakened.""""Should such a trend continue, great harm would be inflicted on the world. This is something we should be highly vigilant against. Relevant countries also should conduct serious reviews and reflections on this,"" said Zhang.The ambassador said that the human society is facing unprecedented challenges, but peace development, cooperation, and mutual benefit are still an unstoppable historical trend.""Globalization is making our global village smaller, but the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries. To strive for a bright future for humankind, all countries should pursue a just cause for common good, and promote inclusiveness, mutual learning, peaceful coexistence, and cooperation,"" the ambassador noted.""There is a need to respect each other´s legitimate and reasonable security concerns, rather than cling to the Cold War mentality or engaging in bloc politics or exclusive small circles,"" he said.""There is also a need to realize win-win cooperation by integrating to economic globalization, rather than expecting others to lose or trying to stay ahead by suppressing the development of other countries,"" he said.Zhang said that major country should behave in a way commensurate with its status, and work together with others to maintain stable international relations, rather than putting the interests of their own over the common interests of the international community or seeking dominance and dictating the whole world.""The world is once again at a historical crossroads.

The bank´s operations will resume on Monday with the FDIC in charge.All insured depositors will have ""full access"" to ""insured"" deposits no later than Monday morning, and official checks ""will continue to clear,"" said the FDIC.Deposit insurance, as per the FDIC´s definition, means that deposits are insured up to 250,000 U.S. dollars per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.The move came after the Santa Clara-headquartered bank announced Wednesday that it lost 1.8 billion dollars in the sale of U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it had invested in, owing to rising interest rates. The bank was also facing shrinking deposits as the tech industry struggled.Panic ensued, leading the share price to tank sharply and triggering the run on the 40-year-old bank that holds 210 billion dollars in assets.The SVB´s failure is the largest bank failure since the collapse of U.S. savings and loan association Washington Mutual in 2008, The Associated Press reported.More than half of the bank´s current loans went to major venture capital and private equity firms, while another quarter went to tech and life sciences companies.The bank has an estimated 6,500 employees, according to U.S. online newspaper TechCrunch. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220581.html,11,3,2023
China's game industry aims for overseas expansion - People's Daily Online,"China´s game industry aims for overseas expansion (Xinhua) 14:25, February 18, 2023GUANGZHOU, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- For three consecutive years, China´s homegrown games have raked in over 100 billion yuan (about 14.7 billion U.S. dollars) in annual sales revenue from overseas markets, according to the 2022 China Gaming Industry Report released recently.The report, released at the China Game Industry Annual Conference in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, shows that Chinese game developers have been actively expanding their business overseas.Due to the downtrend of the global game market under the influence of COVID-19 and heated competition, sales of homegrown Chinese games in the overseas market reached 17.35 billion dollars last year, down 3.7 percent year on year, showing a smaller drop than that of the domestic market.The major target markets for Chineses mobile games are the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea, while the sales in other countries and regions are increasing year by year, indicating the continuous expansion of Chinese enterprises in emerging markets, according to Zhang Yijun, vice chairman of the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association.""Expanding business in overseas markets is becoming a strategic trend for more companies, and the globalization of China´s game industry is becoming increasingly noticeable,"" Zhang said.Chinese internet giant Tencent has been steadily ramping up its efforts to expand its presence in the global gaming market by boosting its technology research and development, fostering content innovation, and building international intellectual property.Many of Tencent´s games have gained popularity worldwide, such as Arena of Valor, PUBG MOBILE and Alchemy Stars. PUBG MOBILE has been released in over 200 countries and regions worldwide, with cumulative global downloads outside the Chinese mainland surpassing 1 billion.Game industry insiders believe that China´s game industry is expanding its global reach through deep localization and refined operations.

In 2015, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission appointed by the Canadian government concluded that children were physically and sexually abused and died in the schools in numbers that may never be fully known.Tzay said the Commission´s Calls to Action should be fully implemented. ""The full resolution of Indian Residential School claims is necessary to achieve true reconciliation, including for Catholic church-run institutions and residential schools established by provinces,"" the UN expert said.Flag marks are seen at the site of unmarked graves near a former indigenous residential school in Saskatchewan, Canada, on June 27, 2021.

Despite comprising 7.7% of the Canadian population, over 53% of children in care are indigenous, up to 90% in some provinces,"" he said.Tzay said intergenerational trauma caused by residential schools and structural racial discrimination has led to a number of present-day human rights violations and abuses, including the current crisis concerning missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. It is estimated that Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women in Canada.""The number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to increase,"" the expert said. The special rapporteur noted that most of the 231 Calls for Justice of the National Inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) and gender diverse people still remain to be implemented. He called on the Canadian government to prevent and combat such violence as a matter of priority, by addressing the root causes of the MMIWG ""epidemic"", including systemic racism and discrimination against Indigenous women and girls.The special rapporteur also expressed concern that Indigenous Peoples have continued to be overrepresented in the criminal justice system.""The situation of Indigenous women and gender diverse peoples is even more devastating as they represent half of the federal prison population,"" Tzay said. ""Indigenous Peoples are often victims of racial profiling, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, and disproportionate use of force by law enforcement personnel.""People visit a memorial at the site of the former St. Paul Indian Residential School in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on Aug. 10, 2021.

""International human rights law entails a duty on the part of the State not only to refrain from violating human rights, but to exercise due diligence to prevent and protect individuals from abuse committed by non-State actors, such as business enterprises, including outside their territories,"" he said.The special rapporteur noted that Canada has embarked on an important journey towards reconciliation that must dismantle structural and systemic racism against Indigenous Peoples and respect Indigenous Peoples' right to self-determination, lands, territories, and resources.""Human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent, and all Indigenous Peoples should have equal rights and opportunities,"" the special rapporteur said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220592.html,11,3,2023

Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks (Xinhua) 12:21, March 11, 2023VIENNA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called for advancing open, transparent, inclusive and sustainable intergovernmental discussion at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address the proliferation risks posed by the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation.Li Song, China´s permanent representative to the IAEA, said at a meeting of the agency´s Board of Governors that the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration poses serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation regime, stimulates arms race, and threatens the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.In September 2021, the United States, Britain and Australia announced the AUKUS deal, under which Washington and London will assist Canberra in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. China and many other countries have repeatedly expressed concerns over the transfer of high purity uranium involved in the pact.The essence of the AUKUS cooperation is the transfer of tons of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from the United States and Britain, both nuclear-weapon states and signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to Australia, a non-nuclear-weapon state, Li said.He added such a ""textbook case"" of nuclear proliferation violates NPT´s objectives and principles, and undermines the IAEA´s existing safeguard system and the international non-proliferation regime.He urged the AUKUS countries to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset, fulfill their international obligations and contribute more to regional peace and stability.It is up to all IAEA member states to seek proper solutions through intergovernmental discussions regarding whether and how to conduct safeguards on the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration, as the matter concerns the interests of all the member states and the integrity and effectiveness of the NPT, he said.Stressing that China respects the right of all other member states to express their views, Li said that China firmly opposes any country trying to impose its own views on others.""The U.S., the UK and Australia, while preaching the so-called 'highest non-proliferation standards,' are labeling normal intergovernmental discussions as 'politicized' and rejecting multilateral discussions. Is this what they call the 'rules-based international order?'"" he said.Noting it is essential to keep the intergovernmental discussion going at the IAEA as the AUKUS countries are about to announce concrete plans for their nuclear submarine cooperation, Li said that only true multilateralism can effectively safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation regime.Li called on the IAEA member states to actively participate in the intergovernmental discussion process to help safeguard the global non-proliferation regime.He said he believes IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and the agency´s secretariat will play their due roles in the process and assist the member states in maintaining and advancing the process.He also urged the AUKUS countries not to settle on relevant safeguards arrangements with the IAEA secretariat or start nuclear submarine cooperation before a consensus is reached among the agency´s member states.The AUKUS countries should respond to the international community´s concerns with concrete actions, fulfill their non-proliferation obligations, and maintain candid and transparent communication with other member states on the basis of equality and mutual respect, he added.Representatives from Russia and other developing countries spoke in support of China´s position on the AUKUS issue at the IAEA board meeting. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220521.html,11,3,2023

The Treasury Department has already instituted ""extraordinary measures"" to ensure bills are being paid now, but in the next few months, those measures won't be enough anymore, the CBO said.""As a result, the government would have to delay making payments for some activities, default on its debt obligations, or both,"" the CBO said.The country has been living on credit for centuries, but the debt is becoming an increasing burden, especially because of the rise in interest rates, said U.S. News and World Report.""High interest means the government has to spend more to service the national debt -- exacerbating the problem, since the government will then owe more money,"" it added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209542.html,18,2,2023
