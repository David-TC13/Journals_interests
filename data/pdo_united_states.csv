Commentary: The post-shame era of U.S. foreign policy - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: The post-shame era of U.S. foreign policy (Xinhua) 13:05, March 04, 2023BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Ethics Committee on Thursday launched an investigation against Congressman George Santos, who has been found to have fabricated major elements of his life story and even lied about his mother´s death in the 9/11 attacks.Not known for aggressively pursuing inquiries, the committee has limited ability to punish lawmakers for wrongdoing. In February, Santos told CNN that he is ""not concerned"" about a House ethics probe. And despite his scandals, Republicans seem reluctant to push for Santos' immediate removal from office.The National Public Radio (NPR) recently lamented that surviving scandals has become easier for politicians like Santos, as the United States has entered an era of ""post-shame politics."" But NPR is a bit slow on the uptake. For people outside the United States, the post-shame era began long ago, particularly in regards to U.S. foreign policy.In his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Samuel P. Huntington noted that the belief in American principles as universal and the U.S. mission to promote and defend these principles throughout the world has been a persistent and potent theme in American foreign policy. However, this theme has become intermittent and weaker as the United States pursues its interests with no sense of shame and a willingness to flout its own principles and values.The ""America First"" policy embodies how times have changed. Championed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, the approach prioritizes U.S. interests over those of other countries. It disregards established international norms, which many have criticized as selfish and isolationist.Sadly, the lack of shame in American foreign policy has persisted beyond Trump´s presidency, as seen in continued U.S. drone strikes, the hasty Afghanistan withdrawal, the theft of Syria oil and its long-arm jurisdiction, to name just a few.The U.S. military´s drone strikes in Somalia and Yemen, among other countries, have been controversial due to their often deadly impact on innocent civilians. Despite the U.S. government´s claims to uphold human rights and the rule of law, the drone strikes have resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of non-combatant deaths. Moreover, the legality of these strikes has been widely questioned, particularly as they were often carried out in countries where the United States was not officially at war and was without the consent of those nations.Since 2001, the U.S. military has conducted several operations in the name of fighting terrorism, resulting in the deaths of over 900,000 individuals, approximately 335,000 of them civilians. These horrific U.S. military campaigns have created 37 million refugees worldwide, with an estimated 48,000 civilians having died due to U.S. airstrikes over the past two decades.A lack of shame was also evident during the abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan, ignoring the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity it had championed. Relying heavily on NATO partners during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the U.S. government suddenly pulled out of the country without sufficient consultation with its allies, leaving them in a complex and precarious position, its allies complained.The U.S. military´s exploitation of Syrian oil resources is another prime example of how America lacks shame. Despite violating international law, the United States and its mercenaries have been accused of extracting an average of 66,000 barrels of oil per day from Syrian oil fields. Such acts of theft have damaged the United States' moral authority and undermined its credibility as a global superpower.Its long-arm jurisdiction also exemplifies a sense of shamelessness. The United States typically enforces its laws on foreign individuals and entities outside its territory, disregarding the sovereignty of other nations. This behavior has been illustrated in cases involving French company Alstom and Chinese company Huawei. In both cases, the United States used its legal and economic prowess to bully others into submission and maintain dominance in key industries while containing rising competitors.The implications of a ""post-shame era"" in U.S. foreign policy extend far beyond the country´s borders. People worldwide associate such shame with the entire nation.To rebuild its reputation, the United States must prioritize collaboration with other countries rather than continue to pursue unilateralism and hegemony. Only then can it play a more constructive and positive role in shaping a safer and more prosperous world.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10216003.html,04,3,2023
"Chinese envoy urges NATO to contribute positively to world peace, stability - People's Daily Online","Chinese envoy urges NATO to contribute positively to world peace, stability (Xinhua) 10:53, February 18, 2023UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China´s permanent representative to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, said on Friday that NATO should contribute positively to world peace and stability, instead of merely being a troublemaker.""We urge NATO to draw lessons from history, abandon the obsolete Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation, and stop dangerous acts of creating imaginary enemies, destabilizing Europe, and messing up Asia Pacific. It should contribute positively to world peace and stability, instead of merely being a troublemaker,"" Zhang told the Security Council briefing on Ukraine.""I would like to point out that NATO, on the one hand, claims to remain a regional defensive alliance, while on the other hand, constantly seeks to breach its geographic confines and expand its agenda, stoke division and tensions, create fears and confrontations, and keep strengthening military and security ties with Asia Pacific countries,"" said the ambassador.""This is obviously self-contradictory. We note with concern that the NATO secretary general recently made many irresponsible and unfounded remarks on the situation of Asia Pacific,"" Zhang explained.The envoy stressed that the Ukraine crisis is, in essence, the culmination of security conflicts in Europe closely related to NATO´s constant eastern expansion since the Cold War.""Pursuing absolute security and political exclusion and containment by force against a specific party is the very crux of the reason why Europe is in the security plight. If following such a mindset, Europe, and even the whole world will be caught up in greater turmoil,"" he said.""We once again call on Russia and Ukraine to cease fire and start peace negotiations as soon as possible,"" said Zhang.He called on the United States, EU, and NATO to sit down with Russia for a comprehensive and in-depth dialogue.""Based on the principle of security indivisibility, they should discuss how to build a balanced, effective, and sustainable security architecture and realize common security,"" he said.""In this context, every effort should be made to stop any attempt to hype up the conflict and to avoid its escalation and expansion,"" the envoy added.Zhang underscored the importance of strictly complying with international treaties and the implementation of legal obligations in good faith, noting that they are the basic requirements of the rule of law.""This is what practicing true multilateralism is about. Regrettably, when it comes to negotiated agreements that failed to be implemented, the Minsk Agreement is not the only case. The Paris Agreement on climate change faces major setbacks because of the withdrawal of one key party,"" he said.The JCPOA, or the Iran nuclear deal, has yet to be revived, he said. ""Some major bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements are now being withdrawn from, violated, hollowed out, and weakened.""""Should such a trend continue, great harm would be inflicted on the world. This is something we should be highly vigilant against. Relevant countries also should conduct serious reviews and reflections on this,"" said Zhang.The ambassador said that the human society is facing unprecedented challenges, but peace development, cooperation, and mutual benefit are still an unstoppable historical trend.""Globalization is making our global village smaller, but the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries. To strive for a bright future for humankind, all countries should pursue a just cause for common good, and promote inclusiveness, mutual learning, peaceful coexistence, and cooperation,"" the ambassador noted.""There is a need to respect each other´s legitimate and reasonable security concerns, rather than cling to the Cold War mentality or engaging in bloc politics or exclusive small circles,"" he said.""There is also a need to realize win-win cooperation by integrating to economic globalization, rather than expecting others to lose or trying to stay ahead by suppressing the development of other countries,"" he said.Zhang said that major country should behave in a way commensurate with its status, and work together with others to maintain stable international relations, rather than putting the interests of their own over the common interests of the international community or seeking dominance and dictating the whole world.""The world is once again at a historical crossroads. We call on all peace-loving countries to unite under the banner of the UN, practice true multilateralism, and promote the spirit of the rule of law, so as to maintain common security, promote common development, and create a shared future,"" Zhang concluded.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209532.html,18,2,2023
U.S. regulators close Silicon Valley Bank - People's Daily Online,"U.S. regulators close Silicon Valley Bank (Xinhua) 14:06, March 11, 2023SAN FRANCISCO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the 16th largest bank in the United States, was closed on Friday by regulators, according to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).An FDIC memo released on Friday said the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed the bank after its stocks sputtered. The bank´s operations will resume on Monday with the FDIC in charge.All insured depositors will have ""full access"" to ""insured"" deposits no later than Monday morning, and official checks ""will continue to clear,"" said the FDIC.Deposit insurance, as per the FDIC´s definition, means that deposits are insured up to 250,000 U.S. dollars per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.The move came after the Santa Clara-headquartered bank announced Wednesday that it lost 1.8 billion dollars in the sale of U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it had invested in, owing to rising interest rates. The bank was also facing shrinking deposits as the tech industry struggled.Panic ensued, leading the share price to tank sharply and triggering the run on the 40-year-old bank that holds 210 billion dollars in assets.The SVB´s failure is the largest bank failure since the collapse of U.S. savings and loan association Washington Mutual in 2008, The Associated Press reported.More than half of the bank´s current loans went to major venture capital and private equity firms, while another quarter went to tech and life sciences companies.The bank has an estimated 6,500 employees, according to U.S. online newspaper TechCrunch. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220581.html,11,3,2023

Despite comprising 7.7% of the Canadian population, over 53% of children in care are indigenous, up to 90% in some provinces,"" he said.Tzay said intergenerational trauma caused by residential schools and structural racial discrimination has led to a number of present-day human rights violations and abuses, including the current crisis concerning missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. It is estimated that Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women in Canada.""The number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to increase,"" the expert said.

Commentary: Competition should not be the leitmotif of China-U.S. ties - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: Competition should not be the leitmotif of China-U.S. tiesBy Xinhua writer Guo Yage (Xinhua) 13:48, February 18, 2023BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Five times did U.S. President Joe Biden name ""China"" in his second State of the Union address on Tuesday night, more than any other countries or regions beyond the United States.That has indeed shed some light on how much weight Washington gives to its relationship with Beijing. Yet the way the U.S. leader tried to define U.S.-China ties, coupled with the U.S. administration´s recent melodramatic handling of the Chinese weather balloon incident, has added to the world´s worries about a much troubled bilateral relationship that bears heavily not only on both countries but the larger world as well.""We seek competition,"" ""to compete with China,"" ""winning the competition"" -- in such a pugnacious narrative, China seems to be put into a zero-sum game where the United States must and will come out as the only victor.In recent years, the anxieties over an ever-stronger China in Washington are mounting -- in their eyes, a steadily growing China increasingly intolerable, and its global supremacy threatened.Despite that the current U.S. administration has repeatedly pledged that the United States respects China´s system, does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, and that it has no intention to have a conflict with China or to contain China, what it has done is pointing the opposite way.To contain China, Washington has exerted almost each and every element of its toolbox, be it smearing campaigns, sanctions or bloc politics. It peddled lies about China´s human rights records, anti-pandemic fight and rightful development, and defamed its domestic and foreign policies, to fan the flames of hostility towards Beijing; it imposed unjustified bans on Chinese tech firms and individuals, to maintain cyber and economic hegemony; it is trying to tie other countries to its China-bashing chariot, and building up the so-called Indo-Pacific encirclement around China.Guided by its own version of ""America First"" doctrine, the Biden administration signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act in last August.The act is designed to ""lower costs, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and counter China,"" according to a fact sheet on the official website of the White House. Almost six months later, the administration moved further to halt U.S. exports to Chinese tech giant Huawei, ignoring the hazards the decision will inflict on global industrial and supply chains.In an attempt to pressure Africa to counter so-called ""China´s influence,"" top U.S. officials peddled the ""debt trap"" conspiracy again during their Africa tour, giving no concern for the welfare of the continent.In 1972, China and the United States issued the Shanghai Communique, acknowledging a key consensual willingness for the two sides to seek common ground while shelving their differences, and laying a political foundation for the development of bilateral ties. Over the years, big names from both sides have reiterated their calls for more and better bilateral cooperation.Over the decades, cooperation in various sectors has generated great benefits for both the Chinese and American people. And despite bilateral tensions and decoupling rhetoric, goods trade between the two countries hit a record 690.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, according to newly released U.S. official data.Unfortunately, Washington is drifting away from the broadly acknowledged consensus on cooperation. The sweetness of healthy competition has soured, and the word ""competition"" has become a synonym for confrontation.As former U.S. trade official William Reinsch was quoted as saying by The Economist in its opinion published in mid-January, Washington has moved from a ""run faster"" to a ""run faster and trip the other guy"" policy, nothing of the sort a responsible major country would ever do.China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Their respective success constitutes opportunities rather than challenges to each other, and the world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together.For the benefit of all, Washington needs to acknowledge this truth about arguably the world´s most important bilateral ties, dump the logic of a zero-sum game, and ditch its hostile China policy, be it on the pretext of ""competition"" or else.It takes political wisdom and good judgment to see the bigger picture of China-U.S. relations, in which cooperation stands as the leitmotif.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209584.html,18,2,2023

Semafor is a U.S. news startup launched just earlier this year.""Over the past decades, China has provided loans to help Africa with economic and social development. Construction works are everywhere in Africa,"" Qin said. ""You can see hospitals, highways, airports, stadiums. Obviously, there is no such trap. It is not a plot. It is transparent, it is sincere.""Citing a study published in July by Debt Justice, a British charity group, Qin said the amount of debt African countries owe to Western private lenders is three times what they owe to China, and interest rates on private loans are double those on Chinese loans.Those findings, Qin said, are proof that ""China is not the biggest creditor of African debts,"" and that ""the debt owed to China is only a small part.""Mentioning the Debt Service Suspension Initiative set up by the Group of 20, Qin said China is an active participant in the initiative, having suspended the most debt service payments among G20 members.""We call on all other creditors, multinational Internet institutions and private lenders to take active actions to reduce the debt burden of African countries in the principle of fair burden sharing and common actions,"" he said.As for the upcoming U.S.-Africa Summit, the ambassador said he would like to see Washington ""come up with more concrete and workable measures"" aimed at facilitating the development and prosperity of the African continent.Qin called on the United States to cooperate with China so that the two of them, as the world´s top two economies and permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, can join forces in promoting peace, security and prosperity in Africa, thus shouldering their shared responsibilities as major countries and meeting the expectations of the international community.The ambassador mentioned a few examples of China-U.S. joint efforts aimed at the betterment of African people´s livelihoods and the promotion of their economic and trade relations with other parts of the world.In addition to jointly helping the Liberian people fight the Ebola epidemic in 2015, Qin said a textile industrial park that is the result of trilateral collaboration among China, the United States and Ethiopia has proven to be a success story, boosting the export of garments from the east African nation to Europe and North America.""We need to extend, broaden our vision and expand our cooperation in Africa,"" the ambassador said of the United States and China.

Development must be priority in UN peacebuilding: Chinese envoy - People's Daily Online,"Development must be priority in UN peacebuilding: Chinese envoy (Xinhua) 11:04, January 28, 2023UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Development must be a priority in UN peacebuilding, whose importance is becoming more pronounced under the current circumstances, said China´s permanent representative to the United Nations on Thursday.Peacebuilding is an important part of the efforts to realize lasting peace and development must be a priority in it, Zhang Jun told an open debate of the Security Council on investment in people to enhance resilience against complex challenges.""Indeed, for many developing countries, development is the ultimate solution to their myriad challenges. The lack of development is an important root cause of many long-lasting, unresolved hot-spot issues on the agenda of the Security Council,"" he said.Development must be prioritized in peacebuilding and resources be mobilized in favor of poverty elimination, people´s livelihoods, education, and public health, among others. Developed countries should honor their commitments regarding official development assistance and climate financing. International financial institutions should fulfill their due responsibilities and be deeply involved in peacebuilding so as to form synergy, he said.Zhang called for a people-centered approach to peacebuilding.UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding should remain committed to the original vision of the UN Charter, uphold a people-centered philosophy, and strive to safeguard people´s interests, advance their well-being, and support their pursuit of a better life, he said.UN peacebuilding should fully support the sovereignty and leadership of the countries concerned and support their exploration of development paths suited to their national conditions. In particular, UN peacebuilding should create enabling conditions and a favorable international environment for those countries' development, he added.Zhang stressed the importance of capacity-building.Post-conflict countries have a lot on their plates. Outside blood transfusion alone is not viable. There is a need to move from blood transfusion to blood generation. Therefore, strengthening capacity-building across the board is an imperative, he said.There is also a need to promote inclusiveness and unity. Post-conflict countries have an important task to ensure people of all walks of life participate equally in state governance and make people the true masters of their own country, said Zhang.While respecting diversity and inclusiveness, all parties of many developing countries with internal conflicts must overcome communal and partisan differences to jointly maintain lasting peace and security. External forces should play a constructive role and refrain from recklessly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Pitting one faction against another will only aggravate division and confrontation, making the situation even more complicated and turbulent, he said.China will continue to support peacebuilding efforts with concrete actions to help realize lasting peace, said Zhang.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0128/c90000-10200076.html,28,1,2023

EU business community worried about U.S. Inflation Reduction Act - People's Daily Online,"EU business community worried about U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (Xinhua) 10:15, December 14, 2022PARIS, Dec.13 (Xinhua) -- As Europe suffers the consequences of the energy crisis and high inflation, the United States Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August.As the IRA aimed to promote the production and use of electric vehicles and other green technologies in the United States through protectionist subsidy policies. The move prompted the European Union (EU) to cry foul.Business leaders across the EU argue that the IRA threatens EU industries and that the reindustrialization of the United States should not bring about deindustrialization in Europe.According to a survey conducted by the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), 39 percent of its member companies in the United States plan to increase investments in the coming months, while only 17 percent are reducing their investments.Currently, several EU companies are concerned about the new U.S. tax incentives in the automotive and environmental sectors, which only apply to production in the United States, and thus discriminate against German companies and, according to experts, clearly violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, Volker Treier, head of foreign trade at the DIHK, said.DIHK´s business survey also shows that one in five companies active in the German automotive supply industry is planning to build up production abroad, especially because of the country´s particularly high energy prices.Siemens Energy believes that a quick response from Europe´s economic policymakers to the U.S. IRA is necessary to keep energy infrastructure capacity on the continent.In absence of such a reaction, manufacturing capacities would be built up in the United States rather than in Europe. ""This is an absolutely critical time,"" Christian Bruch, chief executive officer (CEO) of Siemens Energy, said.Sweden-based electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt is considering delaying its plans to build a factory in Heide, northern Germany, according to a Reuters report.Under the IRA, Northvolt could receive up to 800 million euros (842 million U.S. dollars) in U.S. aid to build a factory, which is four times what the German government is offering, Reuters reported, quoting Northvolt CEO Peter Carlsson.Olivier Joris, executive manager of the Federation of Enterprises in Belgium (FEB/VBO), called the U.S. subsidies ""a protectionist stab in the back from the Americans"".""What worries us is that the investments will be directed more towards the United States than to Europe because of these local content obligations,"" he told the Belgian newspaper L'Echo.According to Professor Bruno Colmant, member of the Belgian Royal Academy, Washington´s protectionist measures have shaken the EU industries.The United States, he wrote, has always had doctrines that suit its own interests. ""Their multilateralism is an argument of circumstance.""Recalling the global financial crises of 1971 and 2008, both of which started in the United States, Colmant said that Washington never ends its wars or pays off its debts.Paris is implementing the France 2030 investment roadmap to support the country´s ecological and economic transition, but since the outbreak of the energy crisis, the reindustrialization related to energy transformation and technological innovation has slowed down.France is particularly dissatisfied with the ""super aggressiveness"" of the U.S. industrial subsidy policy towards European companies.Addressing business leaders and the U.S. Congress on Nov. 30, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that ""Perhaps (the IRA) will solve your problems, but it will make ours worse.""Later that day, Macron again spoke of the ""discriminatory"" subsidies of the United States, saying that the IRA could cause ""problems"" in Franco-American relations and ""will fragment the west.""Discussing the IRA, France´s economic newspaper Les Echos asked ""how can we accept that Europeans should pay five times more for gas from Texas than American consumers? Especially when we are the first to suffer the consequences of the sanctions against Russia. ""It is time to consider America as not only a ""necessary partner"", but also a ""systemic rival"", it said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1214/c90000-10183911.html,14,12,2022

""Because it'll enhance Ukraine´s capacity to defend its territory and achieve the strategic objectives,"" Biden said.Biden said the United States is also sending Ukraine parts and equipment necessary to sustain the sophisticated tanks, adding that Washington will soon begin to train Ukrainian soldiers on how to operate and maintain the tanks, the delivery of which, he noted, will take time.The U.S. delivery of M1 Abrams tanks, among the most powerful and capable of the kind in the world, is considered yet another major development in the Ukraine crisis, potentially further escalating the situation as other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also intended to aid Ukraine with tanks.Before the formal announcement by Biden, reports of U.S. provision of the M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine had already infuriated Russia.Moscow´s ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said Tuesday that ""if a decision to transfer to Kiev M1 Abrams is made, American tanks without any doubt will be destroyed as all other samples of NATO military equipment.""""If the United States decides to supply tanks, it will be impossible to justify such step using arguments about 'defensive weapons,'"" the envoy said. ""This would be another blatant provocation against the Russian Federation.""The U.S. commitment came on the heel of the confirmation from Germany that it will deliver 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks to Ukraine, ending a stalemate where a previously reluctant Germany found itself under increasing pressure from the United States and other allies to authorize tank shipment to Ukraine, which has long demanded such weapons.Other NATO countries, including Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, have either committed to or been considering sending Ukraine the Leopard 2 tanks. Britain has already said it will send its Challenger 2 tanks to aid Ukraine´s offensive in the conflict with Russia.Biden said in his remarks that earlier in the day, he spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ""as part of our close coordination on support for Ukraine.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0126/c90000-10199661.html,26,1,2023
Feature: Japanese abbot vows forever pursuit of peace amid efforts to collect materials on Japanese invasion - People's Daily Online,"Feature: Japanese abbot vows forever pursuit of peace amid efforts to collect materials on Japanese invasion (Xinhua) 10:00, December 14, 2022NAGOYA, Japan, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Shortly before China´s ninth national memorial day for the victims of the Nanjing Massacre, two experts, one from China and the other from Japan, who have long been engaged in the collection and preservation of historical materials of the Japanese invasion, met again online after three years.""Mr. Daito, long time no see. I'm sorry to meet you in this way. We have received the historical materials you helped to collect in Japan this year. Thank you very much,"" said Ai Delin, head of the cultural relics department at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders in Nanjing, eastern China, when talking via video link with Satoshi Daito, abbot of Enkoji Temple in Japan´s Aichi Prefecture.This year, Daito collected 51 sets of historical materials in Japan for the memorial hall, including a battlefield log written by Jun Arai, a soldier among the Japanese invaders, and relevant photos of the Unit Ei 1644 Japanese troops.""In the Battlefield Log, Arai recorded the setting up of a 'comfort station' by Japanese invaders in Nanjing on Jan. 1, 1938, which was the earliest record of its kind after the formal establishment of the 'comfort women' system,"" said Ai, briefing Daito about the preliminary results of Chinese experts' study of the historical materials.""The photos of the Unit Ei 1644 Japanese troops filled the gap of previous studies, which can be verified with the remains of the victims of the Unit Ei 1644 and related research,"" Ai said.Since the year of 2005, Daito has collected and donated more than 4,500 pieces or sets of materials to the memorial hall in Nanjing.""I studied modern Japanese history in college, which is the study of wartime history. In my junior year, I spent 30 days in northeast China, where I visited the sites of mass graves and that of Japanese Unit 731 troops,"" Daito told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.""I can't imagine why the Japanese did such cruel things then, and I wonder what the Japanese should do today,"" he said.Daito became the abbot of the temple upon college graduation, when he also began a study on Japanese monks who accompanied the Japanese army during the war of aggression against China.""At that time, Japanese monks supported and defended the war of aggression against China, which was a problem that I should thoroughly reflect on as a monk,"" said the abbot.Daito believed that historical research, rather than lying in books, requires more collection of historical materials and evidence. ""We should let evidence and historical facts speak themselves, so as to clearly understand the nature of the war of aggression,"" he said.As his research deepened, Daito was exposed to a growing number of historical facts regarding the Japanese war of aggression against China, and his understanding of the nature of the war became much clearer.Two decades ago, Daito visited Nanjing and got in touch with the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, to which he began to provide historical materials related to the Japanese invaders.""Every morning, I would wake up and browse online auction websites for 30 minutes. Without paying attention, valuable historical materials could be missed, or even more likely to be seized by right-wing forces and completely destroyed,"" said Daito, whose work of collecting historical materials has never stopped over the years.""I like history very much and have the ability to collect historical materials, but I don't do it out of interest, but rather the responsibility for the future,"" Daito said.""I hope to leave these historical materials to future generations. In 50 or even 100 years, they can still be studied, which can be accessible not only by researchers in China, but also those in Japan, the United States and other countries. I will pursue peace forever,"" said the abbot.In addition to collecting historical materials, Daito also works to publicize historical facts. Nagoya, where he holds a peace-themed lecture every year just before Aug. 15, the day when Japan surrendered in World War II, has become a focal point for Japanese right-wing forces to attack him.Daito showed Xinhua a video which recorded how the Japanese right-wing elements were attacking him: The right-wingers wore abusive signs on their chests, shouted insults at Daito with loudspeakers, and even besieged him.""I would not argue with them whether the Nanjing Massacre actually took place, instead, I would show them the evidence. Official operation logs of the Japanese army such as the Battlefield Log were all undeniable truth. With the evidence in hand, some people gradually realized that I was not making it up out of thin air through my speech, and gradually acknowledged the fact,"" he said.With unwavering courage to face his opponents, Daito constantly presented historical facts to the right-wingers and taught them practical lessons of modern history, which Japan lacks most at present.But the threat from the right-wing forces never ceased.When asked if he was ever afraid, the 57-year-old abbot replied with a smile: ""A friend of mine in Nanjing told me, 'Don't be afraid. There are 1.4 billion Chinese people on your side.'""On the morning of Dec. 13, when sirens blared in China reminding people to remember the past, the bells also rang across the sea at the Enkoji Temple in Japan´s Aichi Prefecture for the victims killed in the Nanjing Massacre.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1214/c90000-10183889.html,14,12,2022

""It shows that the emphasis China gives to that means that modernization does not discard the past; it adopts the past and carries the past forward.""""Modernization is congruent with the culture of China itself,"" Albrow said.The Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development, he said.Albrow explained that modernization means applying science and technology to human organizations.""On the back of the development of modern technologies, modernization allows countries to take their own culture forward,"" he said. ""Every country is able to develop modernity in the way that suits its own culture.""""China has given an example to the world of how you can have a culturally-led modernization program,"" he added.Albrow, author of the book China and the Shared Human Future: Exploring Common Values and Goals, said that as the world turns its attention to the ongoing ""two sessions"" held in Beijing, it´s important for China to demonstrate that ""democracy comes in many different forms"" and that ""China is moving forward all the time.""The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual meetings of the National People´s Congress, the country´s national legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.""The Chinese version of democracy is one which enlists the support of the whole population, through the efforts of the Communist Party of China to produce a coherent approach to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""China´s form of democracy is an evolving form of discussion and debate, but one which is built upon the consensus of society as a whole.""""It´s a profound kind of democracy and very different from the kinds which exist in so many Western countries, the kinds of democracies that exist, for instance, (in) the United Kingdom or the United States, ones which tend to produce disagreements"" and make it difficult for a country to take any single path into the future, despite its continual debate and discussion about how to go forward, according to Albrow.""Democracy is not a stable condition; democracy is something which is continually moving forward,"" he continued, adding that ""China is in a position now, in this particular 'two sessions', to take us forward again, with well-judged reforms of its own system.""Albrow is confident in the CPC´s resolve to further reforms that will remove institutional obstacles to fulfill Chinese modernization. Over the past decades, the CPC has shown the courage to develop and introduce changes and reforms, he said.

The Treasury Department has already instituted ""extraordinary measures"" to ensure bills are being paid now, but in the next few months, those measures won't be enough anymore, the CBO said.""As a result, the government would have to delay making payments for some activities, default on its debt obligations, or both,"" the CBO said.The country has been living on credit for centuries, but the debt is becoming an increasing burden, especially because of the rise in interest rates, said U.S. News and World Report.""High interest means the government has to spend more to service the national debt -- exacerbating the problem, since the government will then owe more money,"" it added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209542.html,18,2,2023

That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.-- The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For a long time in history, the world was shrouded in the myth that modernization equals Westernization. The emergence of Chinese modernization dispels it, making modernization no longer a single-choice question, but a multiple-choice one.For the world, China´s task to modernize a country of 1.4 billion people, or nearly one-fifth of the global population, is unprecedented. The Herculean pursuit not only captures global attention, but also has global ramifications.Among a series of concepts and initiatives that China promotes in both state governance and global interactions, the Chinese path to modernization is the most popular keyword that people would like to know more about, according to an overseas survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency recently.WHAT ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHINESE AND WESTERN MODERNIZATION?China´s path to modernization is one of peace and development, win-win cooperation, and harmony between humanity and nature, rather than external expansion and plundering.""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.""The modernization of a small number of Western countries was based on the exploitation, oppression and colonization of almost the entire world. China is not developing by exploiting any other country; China is developing itself and modernizing itself, and at the same time helping other countries to develop and modernize,"" he said.China does not seek to exploit or control other nations, and it plays no role in inciting conflicts, said Mokhtar Gobashy, deputy chairman of the Cairo-based Arab Center for Political and Strategic Studies, adding that´s why China has gained respect and popularity in the Arab world.Meanwhile, Chinese modernization emphasizes both material and cultural-ethical advancement, which distinguishes it from Western modernization, said Chen Gang, assistant director of the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore.The coordination of material and cultural-ethical advancement leads the way to realize all-around material abundance as well as people´s well-rounded development, Chen said.WHAT CHINESE MODERNIZATION CAN OFFER FOR THE WORLD?China stands in the world as the second-largest economy and a responsible major country. It always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.Firstly, China is committed to making the world less poor and more equitable.By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.Commenting on China´s poverty reduction drive, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said those achievements are ""the biggest contribution for dramatical reduction of poverty.""More than eradicating absolute poverty, Chinese modernization promotes common prosperity, thereby shrinking the enormous wealth gap and inequality that have risen in tandem with Western modernization.British scholar and political commentator Martin Jacques highlighted China´s pursuit of common prosperity, lamenting how Western countries have never taken it seriously.""For China to embrace common prosperity, to establish a society of greater fairness, greater equity, that is a very important message not only to China, Chinese people but to the world as well,"" he said.China, on its way toward modernization, has also been sharing its development dividends with the rest of the world.Take the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to a World Bank forecast, if all Belt and Road transport infrastructure projects are carried out, the initiative would generate 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars of global revenues annually to 2030. Up to 90 percent of the revenues would go to partner countries.""The most important thing about the BRI is that developing nations could benefit from the great experience in the development of China. BRI gives them the opportunity to create an industrial society and join the modern age. This is something that in the long run would bode well for the future of humanity,"" said Khairy Tourk, professor of economics with the Stuart School of Business at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.Secondly, China is committed to making the world greener and more biodiverse.China ranks first globally in the area of planted forests and forest coverage growth, contributing a quarter of the world´s new forest area in the past decade.From 2012 to 2021, China´s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP declined by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal.So far, China has also emerged as a major proponent of renewable energy, and it is working hard to capitalize on the potential of a green BRI.UNFCCC (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Executive Secretary Simon Stiell spoke highly of China´s firm and consistent stance on actively addressing climate change, as well as its efforts to translate climate commitments into concrete actions.At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis, China continues to make solid progress in dealing with climate change and plays an important role in advancing the global response to climate change, Stiell said.Meanwhile, under China´s presidency, the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the global biodiversity framework ahead of schedule. China has shown leadership in global biodiversity protection, Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, has said.Thirdly, China is committed to making the world more peaceful.For more than 70 years, China has never started a war, never occupied a single square mile of foreign territory, never engaged in proxy wars, and never been a member of or organized any military bloc.It is the only country that has incorporated peaceful development in its Constitution, and the only country among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge no first use of nuclear weapons. China´s track record on peace can stand the scrutiny of history, and its peaceful rise is an unprecedented miracle in human history.Since China´s restoration of its lawful seat at the United Nations in 1971, China has actively participated in the political settlement of major regional hot issues, including the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and the Palestine-Israel issue.In response to mounting conflicts and security challenges in today´s world, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022.And in the GSI Concept Paper released last month, China further expounded the core ideas and principles of the initiative, identified the priorities, platforms and mechanisms of cooperation and demonstrated China´s sense of responsibility for safeguarding world peace and firm resolve to defend global security.""China´s idea of being a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods are consistent with the ideals of the UN Charter,"" former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said.People visit Jianchang ancient city during the Spring Festival holiday in Xichang, southwest China´s Sichuan Province, on Jan. 27, 2023. (Photo by Li Jieyi/Xinhua)AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH?Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization,"" presents another picture of modernization, expands the channels for developing countries to achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity, Xi once said.China´s rise as a global economic power shattered the long-held notion that modernization means Westernization, said David Monyae, director of the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg.The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.""They could find in this model elements for the construction of a development path that can enable them to handle present and future challenges,"" he said.""Modernization has never been simply Westernization,"" Chen said, adding that ""Chinese modernization is a new development model, which can be used as a reference for other countries with similar national conditions or at a similar stage of development."" ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220417.html,11,3,2023

U.S. foreign arms sales increase significantly in fiscal 2022 mainly due to military support for Ukraine - People's Daily Online,"U.S. foreign arms sales increase significantly in fiscal 2022 mainly due to military support for Ukraine (Xinhua) 13:56, January 28, 2023WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. foreign arms sales grew significantly in fiscal year 2022, according to data released by the Department of State, which attributed the increase mainly to U.S. military support for Ukraine during the latter´s conflict with Russia.The total value of State Department-authorized government-to-government foreign military sales was 51.9 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 2022, the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, up 49.1 percent from the previous fiscal year´s 34.8 billion dollars, the data showed.The so-called direct commercial sales, or sales of weapons and military equipment to foreign governments by U.S. defense contractors, also ticked up in fiscal 2022, increasing 48.6 percent to 153.7 billion dollars, compared to 103.4 billion dollars in fiscal 2021.At the end of fiscal 2022, 14,445 entities were registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to conduct defense trade activities, which is a slight increase from fiscal 2021, the department said in a press release dated Wednesday.The State Department attributed the spike to continuous U.S. provision of military assistance to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, while claiming that ""arms transfers and defense trade are important tools of U.S. foreign policy.""According to the Defense Department´s latest update released Wednesday, the United States has more than 27.1 billion dollars in security assistance for Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out on Feb. 24, 2022.The 2022 arms sales numbers are potential deals the State Department has notified Congress, not the final sales, meaning some of the transactions may be refused by Congress, thus forcing the administration to engage in further negotiations.As far as the destinations of those sales are concerned, they cover U.S. allies and partners in Europe, as demands for U.S. weapons soared especially in NATO countries, and in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East regions.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0128/c90000-10200122.html,28,1,2023
Chang'e-5 samples suggest exploitable water resources on the moon - People's Daily Online,"Chang'e-5 samples suggest exploitable water resources on the moon (Xinhua) 13:43, December 13, 2022BEIJING, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- By studying lunar samples retrieved by the Chang'e-5 mission, Chinese scientists found that lunar soil grains retain more solar wind-implanted water at the middle latitude region than previously thought.Based on this finding, the scientists predict that there is a large amount of water resources available for utilization at the high latitude region of the moon.Scientists had previously discovered the presence of surficial water on the moon. They believed that solar wind implantation, volcanic outgassing, and asteroid/comet impacts are likely to be important sources of surficial water on the moon.But how does water reach and remain on the moon? How much water is in the lunar soil? How is the water distributed spatially? A study of the lunar soil samples returned by China´s Chang'e-5 mission has shed new light on these questions.The research team, jointly led by scientists from the National Space Science Center (NSSC) and the Institute of Geology and Geophysics (IGG), both under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), published the new findings on Tuesday in the latest edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Lin Yangting, a researcher at the IGG who led the study, explained that the water they refer to is not water in the usual sense, but the structural water found in soil grains. Since hydrogen is one of the main components of water, the hydrogen concentration is usually used to express the water content.The research team selected 17 lunar soil grains, including olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase and glass, from Chang'e-5 samples and carried out experimental analysis of the hydrogen content and isotopes using a newly-developed profiling technique on a nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometer.The scientists found that the average water content in the topmost 0.1-micron zone of the lunar grains is 0.7 weight percent, rather high for nonaqueous minerals. They then proved through the deuterium-hydrogen ratios that the water on the lunar surface was solely derived from the solar wind.""The hydrogen ions emitted from the Sun reach at an average speed of 450 kilometers per second and they hit the surface of the lunar soil grains like bullets,"" said Tian Hengci, the paper´s co-first author, an associate professor at the IGG.Based on the analysis of heating experiments, the research team conducted the simulations on the preservation of hydrogen in lunar soils at different temperatures, and the results showed that the solar wind-originated water could be well preserved in the middle and high latitude regions of the lunar surface.Previously, scientists were unable to use the returned samples to study the possible influence of latitude on water content on the lunar surface, since the lunar samples collected by the Apollo missions of the United States and the Luna missions of the Soviet Union were all from the low latitude areas of the moon.China´s Chang'e-5 mission successfully retrieved 1,731 grams of lunar samples at the end of 2020. The probe landed at 43.06 degrees north latitude of the moon, higher than the latitudes of the landing sites of the Apollo and Luna missions. In addition, the crystallization age of the basalt in the Chang'e-5 landing area is about 2 billion years old, much younger than the sampling areas of the Apollo and Luna missions.""The Chang'e-5 samples provided us with the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind, and the implantation and migration of water on the lunar surface,"" said Xu Yuchen, the co-first author of the paper from the NSSC.The research team built a dynamic equilibrium model between hydrogen implantation by solar wind and diffusion loss by heating, based on the analysis results of the Chang'e-5 samples and the experimental data of the Apollo samples.The model predicted that lunar grains in the high latitude region contain more solar wind-delivered water in their rims. The topmost 0.1-micron zone of the lunar grains could contain as much as 8.5 weight percent of water. And if the lunar soils are sorted by particle size, the water content in the particles less than 2 microns could reach 2 weight percent.""This discovery is of great significance for the future utilization of water resources on the moon. China plans to build a scientific research station in the south polar region of the moon. Our research shows that the south polar region of the moon may have more water than previously thought. And it is relatively easy to exploit and use the water contained in the lunar soil through particle size sorting and heating,"" said Lin.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1213/c90000-10183513.html,13,12,2022
Commentary: China's improved anti-COVID measures a booster dose to global recovery - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: China´s improved anti-COVID measures a booster dose to global recoveryBy Xinhua writer Zhao Wencai (Xinhua) 08:29, December 14, 2022An elderly resident receives a shot of COVID-19 vaccine at home during a medical service for senior citizens in Dongcheng District of Beijing, capital of China, May 10, 2022. (Xinhua/Chen Zhonghao)- Three years on, with medical systems fortified, new variants getting tamer and 90 percent of the population armed with vaccines, China is better positioned to confront the virus and navigate out of the pandemic quagmire.- In a recent report on China´s economic outlook, Morgan Stanley predicted that China would stage a comeback from mid-2023, achieving a full-year growth of 5 percent.BEIJING, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has rolled out a string of modified measures in line with the evolving pandemic situation and Beijing´s drive to better align anti-COVID efforts with economic and social development.The adjustments will give a much-needed booster shot to both the Chinese and global economies.China´s fight against the COVID pandemic has entered a new stage. Beijing is working to steer people´s lives back to normal after three years of rigorously managing the outbreak. It allows mild patients to quarantine at home and permits entry into some public places without a negative test result.Travel platforms showed that searches for air tickets to tourist spots like China´s Sanya and Harbin jumped as much as seven times after the new measures were released, with many people looking to travel around the Lunar New Year holiday in January.Restaurants are opening for dining in. More than 70 percent of the country´s cinemas have resumed operations. Advance tickets for James Cameron´s blockbuster ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" scheduled to hit China´s theaters in mid-December, have already been snapped up.Unsurprisingly, some biased media outlets and pundits in the West have already rushed to question China´s latest adjustments, warning of darker times ahead. A closer look reveals that many of these skeptics previously criticized China for what they described as ""draconian"" COVID-19 measures over the years.A worker works at a factory of Harbin Electric Machinery Company Ltd. of Harbin Electric Corporation in Harbin, northeast China´s Heilongjiang Province, Sept. 3, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Song)Actually, the improved measures are based on China´s efforts to suppress the pathogen since the beginning of the pandemic, an approach that puts people and their lives above everything else.For three years, China has kept the lowest infection and fatality rates among all major countries. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the COVID infection rate in China is 2,883 per million people, while in the United States, it´s 299,595 per million. The fatality rate is 11 per million people in China and 3,267 per million in the United States.The increase in life expectancy during the pandemic also bespeaks China´s anti-COVID success. Over the past two years, China has increased life expectancy by 0.63 years, from 77.93 years in 2020 to 78.2 years in 2021. By contrast, primarily fueled by the pandemic, Americans' life expectancy dropped from 77 years in 2020 to 76.1 years in 2021.Models indicate that China would have suffered enormously, featuring millions of deaths, if it had adopted the U.S. strategy and opened up earlier when the previous variants were much more lethal.The decisive and responsive anti-COVID measures have delivered China a precious time window to brace its people for a showdown with the virus. While containing the virus throughout the pandemic, China built and reinforced a shield against the raging virus. In 2021 alone, China set up an additional 8,013 medical institutions, increased the number of hospital beds by 348,000 and trained 508,000 health workers.As a responsible member of the international community, China has never shied away from its commitment to the global fight against the pandemic.A batch of COVID-19 vaccines donated by China arrives at an airport in Tunis, Tunisia, Feb. 22, 2022. (Photo by Adel Ezzine/Xinhua)To strengthen global defenses, China provided anti-epidemic materials to 153 countries and 15 international organizations, sent medical expert groups to 34 countries, shared epidemic response knowledge with more than 180 countries and international organizations, and offered over 2.2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations.To stabilize the global industrial and supply chains, China has been sharing its enormous market and continues providing industrial goods and consumer products for the world. In 2020, China was the only major economy to report positive economic growth. And last year, China accounted for more than 25 percent of global economic growth.Three years on, with medical systems fortified, new variants getting tamer and 90 percent of the population armed with vaccines, China is better positioned to confront the virus and navigate out of the pandemic quagmire.Analysts have predicted that China would leave the shadow of COVID-19 behind sooner than expected. In a recent report on China´s economic outlook, Morgan Stanley predicted that China would stage a comeback from mid-2023, achieving a full-year growth of 5 percent.As the largest locomotive of the global recovery, China will deliver more certainty to a shaky global economy.At a meeting earlier this month to plan economic work for 2023, China´s top leadership vowed to boost opening up at a higher level and attract further foreign investment. Optimizing pandemic response measures is one of the steps.Following the adjustments of anti-COVID measures, global markets were sent flying. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies rose. Strategists of investment banks raised their recommendation ratings for Chinese equities to overweight. The price of commodities, including copper and oil, climbed on the promise of increased demand from China, one of the world´s biggest consumers.Heads of major international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, commended China´s return to normal, expecting a dynamic and resilient Chinese economy to continue shoring up international supply chains and galvanizing global growth.However, it´s worth remembering that the pandemic has not ended. Thousands of people worldwide are dying from it each day, billions have not received a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and almost everyone´s life has been impacted by the virus, more or less. Putting the pandemic behind us needs more time and effort.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1214/c90000-10183781.html,14,12,2022
Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks (Xinhua) 12:21, March 11, 2023VIENNA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called for advancing open, transparent, inclusive and sustainable intergovernmental discussion at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address the proliferation risks posed by the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation.Li Song, China´s permanent representative to the IAEA, said at a meeting of the agency´s Board of Governors that the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration poses serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation regime, stimulates arms race, and threatens the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.In September 2021, the United States, Britain and Australia announced the AUKUS deal, under which Washington and London will assist Canberra in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. China and many other countries have repeatedly expressed concerns over the transfer of high purity uranium involved in the pact.The essence of the AUKUS cooperation is the transfer of tons of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from the United States and Britain, both nuclear-weapon states and signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to Australia, a non-nuclear-weapon state, Li said.He added such a ""textbook case"" of nuclear proliferation violates NPT´s objectives and principles, and undermines the IAEA´s existing safeguard system and the international non-proliferation regime.He urged the AUKUS countries to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset, fulfill their international obligations and contribute more to regional peace and stability.It is up to all IAEA member states to seek proper solutions through intergovernmental discussions regarding whether and how to conduct safeguards on the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration, as the matter concerns the interests of all the member states and the integrity and effectiveness of the NPT, he said.Stressing that China respects the right of all other member states to express their views, Li said that China firmly opposes any country trying to impose its own views on others.""The U.S., the UK and Australia, while preaching the so-called 'highest non-proliferation standards,' are labeling normal intergovernmental discussions as 'politicized' and rejecting multilateral discussions. Is this what they call the 'rules-based international order?'"" he said.Noting it is essential to keep the intergovernmental discussion going at the IAEA as the AUKUS countries are about to announce concrete plans for their nuclear submarine cooperation, Li said that only true multilateralism can effectively safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation regime.Li called on the IAEA member states to actively participate in the intergovernmental discussion process to help safeguard the global non-proliferation regime.He said he believes IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and the agency´s secretariat will play their due roles in the process and assist the member states in maintaining and advancing the process.He also urged the AUKUS countries not to settle on relevant safeguards arrangements with the IAEA secretariat or start nuclear submarine cooperation before a consensus is reached among the agency´s member states.The AUKUS countries should respond to the international community´s concerns with concrete actions, fulfill their non-proliferation obligations, and maintain candid and transparent communication with other member states on the basis of equality and mutual respect, he added.Representatives from Russia and other developing countries spoke in support of China´s position on the AUKUS issue at the IAEA board meeting. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220521.html,11,3,2023
Founder of crypto exchange FTX faces charges from multiple U.S. agencies - People's Daily Online,"Founder of crypto exchange FTX faces charges from multiple U.S. agencies (Xinhua) 09:48, December 14, 2022NEW YORK, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Multiple U.S. agencies have filed charges against Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former chief executive officer of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX, which went into bankruptcy in November 2022.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors and customers in crypto asset trading platform FTX Trading Limited, the SEC said in a press release.""Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform´s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire,"" said a complaint by the SEC.Bankman-Fried, born in 1992 in California, improperly diverted customer assets to his privately-held crypto hedge fund Alameda Research LLC and then used the customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations, the complaint said.Though FTX had risk measures to protect customer assets, Bankman-Fried exempted Alameda from the risk mitigation measures and provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited ""line of credit"" funded by the platform´s customers, according to the complaint.Bankman-Fried also misled investors in the months ahead of FTX´s bankruptcy so as to raise more money, according to the SEC.The SEC seeks to permanently enjoin Bankman-Fried from engaging in similar activities, order the defamed founder of FTX to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, impose civil money penalties and an officer and director bar on Bankman-Fried and prohibit him from participating in the offer or sales of securities including crypto asset securities.Bahamian authorities arrested Bankman-Fried on Monday at the request of the U.S. government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney´s Office for the South District of New York (SDNY), said SDNY on its social media account.U.S. federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against Bankman-Fried with eight counts including wire fraud on customers and lenders, and various conspiracy counts including conspiring to defraud the United States and violate campaign finance laws, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday morning.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed charges on Tuesday against Bankman-Fried for violations of federal commodities laws.Bankman-Fried planned to testify at a hearing by the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services virtually on Tuesday.Headquartered in the Bahamas, FTX once had a valuation of 32 billion U.S. dollars and suffered a liquidity squeeze after it was revealed that the exchange had a shortfall of around 8 billion dollars resulting from the misuse of client funds and losses in its trading arm Alameda Research Limited.FTX´s announcement for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a U.S. court on Nov. 11 sent shockwaves across the crypto space and financial markets and triggered governmental probes.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1214/c90000-10183871.html,14,12,2022
To ensure that the global economy grows on right track - People's Daily Online,"To ensure that the global economy grows on right trackBy Huan Yuping (People´s Daily) 13:58, February 18, 2023Recent reports issued by the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other organizations pointed out that the world economy will face greater downward pressure and increasing risks of recession because of the tightened monetary policies adopted by major economies such as the United States and Europe, geopolitical intentions, and continuous food and energy crises.Faced with challenges, the international society is in urgent need to improve the effectiveness of global economic governance. In particular, major economies should enhance macroeconomic policy coordination, jointly contribute to safeguarding an open world economy and make concerted efforts to maintain long-term and stable economic development in the post-pandemic era.To balance inflation control and stabilizing growth is a prominent challenge facing the world economy this year.Some reports believe that high inflation, which has bothered developed economies, is not likely to be completely coming down this year, so these economies' will keep tightening their monetary policies, which increases the risk of economic recession.The IMF attributed the possible slowing growth this year to advanced economies, whose growth is projected to decline from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.2 percent in 2023.Advanced economies' maintaining deflation would create negative spillover effects, which might bring higher debt and financial risks to emerging markets and developing countries.Growing trend of unilateralism and protectionist policies adopted by a few countries remain another major challenge facing the world economy.For political purposes, a few major countries that are of huge influence over the world economy, have long followed irresponsible policies and measures that are against the market law and hinder cooperation and development. It triggered concerns from the international community that the world economy, which is in sluggish recovery, may face higher risks if such practice continues.A severe fragmentation of the global economy after decades of increasing economic integration could reduce global economic output by up to 7 percent, but the losses could reach 8-12 percent in some countries, if technology is also decoupled, the International Monetary Fund said in a new staff report.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva noted that economic integration has helped billions of people become wealthier, healthier, and better educated. ""This peace and cooperation dividend should not be squandered"".Modern history reminds the world that major countries should practically take their responsibilities and enhance mutual coordination, which is of vital importance for the world economy to maintain stable progress amidst raging torrents.At present, it is widely expected around the world that a few major countries should reclaim their sense of responsibility and play a constructive role in promoting the strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy.The world economy has come to a crossroads. Only through enhanced coordination and cooperation can its anti-risk capability be raised.It´s important to see that this round of inflation has multiple reasons. Apart from the supply-side factors, the world needs to enhance international cooperation, address both the supply and demand sides, fix industrial and supply chains and pay close attention to energy and food security.While controlling inflation, advanced economies should work to reduce the negative spillover effects caused by their adjustment in monetary policies and practically safeguard the stability of the international financial system.Building an open world economy serves the common interests of the international society. All parties should build consensus and make joint efforts. Major countries, in particular, should maintain the stability of the global economic system, rules and foundation with concrete actions, rather than taking the lead to hinder international economic cooperation or divide global economy.Crises and opportunities always emerged simultaneously in the history of world economy.While effectively coping with risks, countries should take active and appropriate management measures to release more benefits of economic globalization and to rebalance the process of economic globalization.They should focus more on development issues, jointly work to make global development more inclusive, beneficial to all and resilient, and accelerate the implementation of UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.They should also strengthen international cooperation on tackling climate change and push for a comprehensive green transition in economic and social development.As the world´s largest economy, China is picking up speed in its own economic recovery and committed to improving global economic governance.

Since then, the strain is spreading quickly in the United States.Early study suggests XBB.1.5 has a couple of concerning mutations that suggest it is even more contagious than other strains, possibly the most transmissible one so far.While XBB.1.5 is spreading easier, scientists said it does not seem to cause more severe disease.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10216052.html,04,3,2023
"Xiplomacy: China, LAC countries embrace new era of win-win cooperation - People's Daily Online","Xiplomacy: China, LAC countries embrace new era of win-win cooperation (Xinhua) 08:29, January 28, 2023MEXICO CITY, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- For decades, Argentines have dreamt of having a hydroelectric power plant on the Santa Cruz River, one of the last large free-flowing rivers in the region of Patagonia encompassing the southern end of South America, so that they could be less dependent on energy imports.But the plan to build one was on ice at one point because of the engineering challenges of adverse weather conditions like freezing temperatures and perennial gusts, as well as environmental impacts given the river´s proximity to an iconic glacier.Now, thanks to Argentina´s determination and Chinese expertise, Argentines are about to witness their dream coming true.BREEZE OF THE BELT AND ROADOn the first day of the Year of the Rabbit, when most of the Chinese people across the world were still enjoying their Spring Festival vacation, Chinese engineer Xiong Yongfeng went to work on the construction site of the Nestor Kirchner-Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Power Plant on Santa Cruz. Upon arrival, Xiong took out some construction blueprints, and started a heated discussion with Argentine engineers on site. Surrounding him and his Argentine colleagues were running machines and moving construction vehicles.Xiong was one of the 50 Chinese staff remaining on duty during the festival break. Together with Argentine staff, they ensured that the construction is progressing smoothly, so that ordinary Argentines could be a step closer to their ""energy dream.""Besides increasing energy sufficiency in Argentina, the project has improved the living conditions of many, generating jobs and building roads for the local communities. Braving numerous challenges, Chinese and Argentine engineers have also guaranteed the environmental sustainability of the project, as the plant has been designed with fish passes and ecological bottom wells.Argentina is not the only Latin American country working with China on infrastructure construction under the framework of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. The reconstruction of the Eloy Alfaro International Airport in the Ecuadorian city of Manta, which was hit hard by a powerful earthquake in 2016, has enhanced the country´s trade, tourism and business ties with the rest of the world; a UHV power transmission lane stretching from north to south in Brazil, a country abundant in energy but limited by unequal distribution, has brought benefits to 22 million Brazilians, or 10 percent of the country´s population.Eduardo Regalado, a researcher at the International Policy Research Center of Cuba, said the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has given a strong boost to the development of relations between China and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries.China has played a key role in promoting infrastructure construction in Latin America, while economic and social development in the region has injected new impetus into China-LAC relations, Regalado said.As Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a video address delivered at the seventh Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) held Tuesday in Buenos Aires, more and more countries in the region have engaged in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with China, supported and participated in the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, and are working with China in building a China-LAC community with a shared future.BILATERAL TRADE IN BLOOMDalian Port in northeast China has opened a direct shipping route to import cherries from Chile.Earlier in the month, the ship GSL Tinos, loaded with 616 twenty-foot equivalent units of Chilean cherries, docked at the container terminal in Dalian after a 22-day trip.Of the total, 592 TEUs of cherries would be delivered directly to the wholesale markets in China. The others would be transferred to the Republic of Korea via Dalian Port.Chilean cherries are increasingly favored by Chinese consumers, and the market demand continues to rise. ""China has become our main market and strategic partner,"" said Victor Maroto, a representative of Chilean shippers.In addition to Chilean cherries, blueberries from Peru and beef from Uruguay are also among the best-selling products in China, especially during the Spring Festival. In Guangzhou in southern China, Ecuadorian roses and Colombian hydrangeas have become good choices for local people to decorate their houses.During the fifth China International Import Expo held in November 2022 in Shanghai, Latin American companies showcased such quality products as Argentine wine and Colombian chocolate, hoping to take a bigger share in the Chinese market.Meanwhile, Latin American countries have become important markets for Chinese companies. In Ecuador, Chinese vehicles lead the automobile market as consumers are increasingly drawn to their design, sticker price and innovative features. Automobiles, vans, SUVs and trucks of more than 40 Chinese brands are estimated to be sold in Ecuador.Even during the pandemic, bilateral trade has showed strong vitality. Data from China´s General Administration of Customs showed that in 2022, the total trade value between China and Latin America and the Caribbean exceeded 450 billion U.S. dollars for the second consecutive year.TOGETHER TOWARD A BETTER FUTUREIn Mexico, the ""home of corn,"" China´s technical cooperation with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) is making steady progress.Bram Govaerts, director general of CIMMYT, said the collaboration with China can be regarded as one of the mutually beneficial examples of working together to safeguard the world´s food security.""CIMMYT and China together can be partners,"" said Govaerts. ""CIMMYT can work with China for new wheat varieties that can fight climate change, for new maize varieties that can sustain new diseases.""China and Latin America have set a good example of South-South cooperation, and they are expected to carry out more exchanges and cooperation through such multilateral platforms as the China-CELAC Forum in the future, so as to jointly benefit the world, Argentine sociologist Marcelo Rodriguez said.In Tuesday´s video address, Xi said: ""We highly value our relations with CELAC, and take CELAC as our key partner in enhancing solidarity among developing countries and furthering South-South cooperation. That is why China has been working with LAC countries to steadily strengthen the China-CELAC Forum and take the China-LAC relationship into a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and benefits for the people.""In fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine cooperation between China and multiple Latin American countries has helped protect people´s lives and health. China-LAC cooperation in science and technology innovation has also yielded fruitful results, including China-Brazil Earth resources satellite cooperation and an astronomy research center jointly launched by China and Chile.As Xi said in the video address, China is ready to join forces with LAC countries to promote world peace and development, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and open up an even brighter future for the world.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0128/c90000-10199840.html,28,1,2023

(Xinhua/Shan Yuqi)NATO'S PROMISE OF TANKS FOR UKRAINEOn Wednesday, the German government not only agreed to provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2 battle tanks from its own stocks but also approved of its customer countries doing the same.""We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a government meeting in Berlin.Hours later, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that his administration will provide Ukraine with 31 U.S.-made M1 Abrams tanks. A day later, the Canadian Defense Ministry announced it would send four Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and is considering sending more at a later date.Ahead of the latest promised supplies, some other NATO countries had announced increasing weapon supplies to Ukraine, especially heavier weapons.Britain said on Jan. 14 it would send 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks to aid Ukraine´s offensive against Russia, while other NATO countries, including Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, have either committed to or been considering sending Ukraine Leopard 2 tanks, though Berlin´s approval -- a re-export requirement -- had not been given at that time.According to military arms experts, the German-made Leopard 2 is one of the most reputable battle tanks in the world, perhaps second only to the U.S.-made M1 Abrams tank.The deliveries of Leopard 2 tanks will take Ukrainian ground forces to a qualitatively new level, Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press.However, Huang Rihan, professor at the School of International Relations of China´s Huaqiao University, told Xinhua that tanks from so many different countries need time to adapt to the front-line situation in Ukraine, which will limit their performance.""Therefore, it is a bit of an exaggeration to say now that these tanks will drastically change the battlefield situation,"" he said.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz attends a question session of the Bundestag in Berlin, capital of Germany, Jan. 25, 2023. (Xinhua/Ren Pengfei)DIVISIONS AMONG NATO ALLIESGermany´s move was announced following weeks of mounting pressure from its allies, including the United States and other NATO members, who urged Berlin to step up its military support to Ukraine.Unlike countries such as the United States, Germany has been more cautious in providing heavier weapons to Ukraine, trying to avoid an escalation of the deterioration of German-Russian relations.Ahead of Germany´s decision, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov had told Russian news agency TASS that shipments of Leopard tanks to Ukraine would ""not bode well"" for Russian-German relations and would ""undoubtedly leave an unavoidable mark for the future of these relations.""Earlier this month at Davos, when asked about supplying tanks to Ukraine, Scholz said ""we are never doing something just by ourselves, but together with others, especially the United States.""At that time, some analysts said Germany was trying to dodge the front-runner-role in fueling the present war. However, Washington responded that it was Germany´s own decision whether to supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.This photo taken on Dec. 8, 2022 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States.

The tight labor market and rising inflation in the United States and the eurozone may result in a return to tighter monetary policy and an economic slowdown.For Finland, Nordea Bank, the largest financial services group in the Nordic region and one of the biggest banks in Europe, projects zero gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year and 1 percent growth in 2024.The growth of Finland´s economy slowed down at the end of 2022, when the strong rise in energy prices and interest rates reduced private consumption and export demand. As a result, the economic outlook for this year is very mixed with bleak consumer and corporate confidence.However, inflation in the country is expected to ease along with an anticipated wage growth, which would relieve household finances towards the end of the year, the bank said.At the same time, economic growth in the Nordic states will shrink by 0.5 percent this year and will grow by 0.9 percent next year, while the global economy will grow by 3.2 percent in 2023 and by 2.7 percent in 2024, the bank said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0126/c90000-10199659.html,26,1,2023

The government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation demonstrates the steady progress and China´s impressive determination on the policy, saying that ""We remained committed to opening up wider to the world and expanded international economic and trade cooperation to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes.""As an Egyptian living in China for years, I have witnessed the country´s wider opening-up pursuit, and I believe an open China is vital to the struggling global economic recovery.STORIES BEHIND ""THINNER"" SUITCASESI have friends of different nationalities who share the same feeling that our suitcases are ""thinner"" these days when returning to China from holidays. Over a decade ago, my family would always stuff my suitcase with cheese, dates, spices and other local specialties before I returned to China.Now, however, more global products are entering the Chinese market through platforms such as the China International Import Expo (CIIE). With Arab specialties including Egyptian oranges, dates from the United Arab Emirates and essential oils from Syria easily available in Chinese supermarkets, I no longer need to carry these things all the way to China.According to the government work report, China developed new forms of foreign trade over the past five years and built 152 new integrated pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce. Major trade events such as CIIE, the China Import and Export Fair, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the China International Consumer Products Expo have delivered positive results.Furthermore, China simplified customs clearance procedures and reduced the clearance time for imports and exports by 67 percent and 92 percent, respectively, bringing about a significant reduction in related compliance costs, the work report added.Amidst the growing trend of trade protectionism and the so-called ""decoupling and severing industrial and supply chains"" by some developed countries, China´s efforts toward trade liberalization and facilitation have become increasingly crucial.With an enormous market of more than 1.4 billion people, China is the world´s largest goods trader, a major trading partner of over 140 countries and regions, and has the world´s second-largest consumer market and import market. There is no doubt that China is a key hub of the global economic cycle, benefiting the entire world with the dividends of its super-sized market.STRONG MAGNET FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT""Intensifying efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment,"" as stated in the government work report, is one of the key priorities of the Chinese government´s economic work in 2023.During my over a decade-long experience of living in China, I have seen an increasing number of international companies investing in the country.

But later many of these companies set up research and development centers here to continuously increase the added value of their industrial chains.In 2022, foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 8 percent year on year to 189.13 billion U.S. dollars, reinforcing its status as a magnet for foreign investors.Among Arab countries, Gulf countries' investment in China is particularly eye-catching. Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Kuwait National Petroleum Company and other energy giants have carried out in-depth investment cooperation with many Chinese provinces and enterprises.China and Arab countries have adhered to pursuing mutual benefits, promoted trade and investment facilitation, and multiplied the growth of mutual investment and economic and trade cooperation, according to the Saudi Arabian newspaper Alriyadh.The sovereign wealth funds of Gulf states have long been mainly invested in developed markets in Europe and the United States. In recent years, as China-Arab relations have continued to improve and their economic ties deepened, China´s market and assets are gradually favored by sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.In 2018, Abu Dhabi Global Market, an international financial center in Abu Dhabi, opened its first overseas representative office in Beijing.Ajlan &Bros Holding Group, a leading investment holding company in the Middle East and one of the largest private enterprises of Saudi Arabia in China, has been doing business in China for more than 20 years. With the increasingly close economic and trade exchanges between China and Saudi Arabia, the company has set up four investment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong since 2017.Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) has jumped onto the bandwagon of China´s green development. The company announced a carbon-neutral strategy and plans to actively expand investment cooperation in China.""We need to 'join hands' with each other instead of 'letting go' of each other´s hands. We need to 'tear down walls,' not 'erect walls.'"" I was deeply impressed by these inspiring words by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and I believe China walks its talk.A sentence in the government work report fully expresses China´s confidence in attracting more foreign investment, saying that with a vast and open market, China is sure to provide even greater business opportunities for foreign companies in China.MORE FRIENDS, MORE CHANCESThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has attracted more than three-quarters of the world´s countries and 32 international organizations.Over the past decade, Chinese companies have invested 397.9 billion yuan (about 57 billion U.S. dollars) in cooperation zones built in countries along the Belt and Road, creating 421,000 local jobs.The BRI has made significant contributions to Egypt´s modernization process and a notable example is the country´s new administrative capital.A modern city is taking shape in the desert east of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. Constructed by a Chinese company, the Central Business District (CBD) in Egypt´s new administrative capital boasts the tallest building in Africa, standing at 385.8 meters.This achievement is a testament to the growing friendship between Egypt and China. The project is nearing completion within just over four years. According to Egypt´s Al-Ahram newspaper, ""China speed"" makes Egypt´s dream come true.From material selection to the application of technologies, the project embodies the concept of green development and can help Cairo effectively deal with air pollution and other ""big city diseases.""The CBD in Egypt´s new administrative capital has become a popular spot, bustling with visitors. I would go there every time I go back to Egypt.The outcomes of high-quality BRI development are spread across Africa. I have experienced the Chinese-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway. From the station to the trains, I was struck by the modern scene around me. Passengers were enjoying the convenience and efficiency of the self-service ticket vending machines, while the crew provided excellent services.China´s high-level opening-up has been a continuous success, and the BRI has become an international public good and a platform for international cooperation, Karim Adel, head of the Cairo-based Al Adl Center for Economic and Strategic Studies, told Xinhua.China´s other initiatives, especially the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, have also won the support of many countries, Adel added.Last year, I had the privilege of participating in the translation and review work of the Arabic version of the fourth volume of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China."" With every word I read, I gained a deeper appreciation for the thoughts of the Chinese leader.In 2021, Xi said that on the road to the well-being of all humankind, no country or nation should be left behind. All countries and nations are equally entitled to development opportunities and rights to development, Xi said at the Communist Party of China and World Political Parties Summit. His words deeply touched me.There is an Arabic proverb that goes, ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together,"" just like how in China people often say ""more friends, more chances.""China is a country committed to high-level opening-up and I firmly believe that its efforts will bring more concrete opportunities to the world. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220517.html,11,3,2023

While we were clearing the north of Syria from Daesh, the U.S. sent the YPG and Daesh members to Afghanistan by planes and buses during Pompeo´s tenure. They are responsible for the attacks in Afghanistan,"" Cavusoglu said.The Turkish minister said he believed Pompeo´s purpose to write the book was to propel him to the U.S. presidency.Ankara considers the Kurdish People´s Protection Units (YPG) as the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is listed as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the United States and the European Union and has rebelled against the Turkish government for over three decades.Pompeo, who served as U.S. secretary of state between 2018 and 2021, said in his book ""Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love"" that he was worried that Ankara´s plan to fight against the IS could lead to ethnic cleansing of the Kurds in Syria.Ties between the two NATO member states have long been strained due to U.S. military support to the YPG, which cooperated with Washington in carrying out operations against the IS.The Turkish army launched Operation Euphrates Shield in 2016, Operation Olive Branch in 2018, Operation Peace Spring in 2019, and Operation Spring Shield in 2020 in northern Syria targeting both the IS and the YPG groups.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0128/c90000-10199971.html,28,1,2023

According to the report, ""The U.S. engagement largely seeks to counter China and Russia"" in Africa and globally rather than take a tangible approach to addressing Africa´s development challenges.The report also shows that, compared with the U.S. bullying diplomacy, China has been eagerly welcomed by African countries because of its stance on non-interference in internal affairs and win-win approach to its relations with Africa.Wang said that this report, issued by a renowned academic institution of Africa, offers an African perspective on U.S.-Africa relations. ""The report also points out that the U.S. policy towards Africa serves the United States' own interests and aims to force African countries to choose sides on issues of global security, international landscape and great power competition.""The U.S. strong-arm diplomacy will not succeed in Africa, said the spokesperson.""Supporting Africa´s development is the common responsibility of the international community,"" Wang said, adding that China has all along advanced its relations with Africa on the basis of the principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith and with a commitment to the greater good and shared interests. Its partnership with African countries is always based on mutual respect, equality and sincere cooperation.The spokesperson said that, with the U.S.-Africa Summit to be held soon, China welcomes a greater international focus on Africa, and firmly opposes turning Africa into a wrestling ground for major-country rivalry or using one´s Africa strategy as a tool to curb and attack other countries' cooperation with Africa.""African countries have the wisdom and capability to choose cooperation partners that help advance African interests,"" Wang said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1214/c90000-10183904.html,14,12,2022
China's game industry aims for overseas expansion - People's Daily Online,"China´s game industry aims for overseas expansion (Xinhua) 14:25, February 18, 2023GUANGZHOU, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- For three consecutive years, China´s homegrown games have raked in over 100 billion yuan (about 14.7 billion U.S. dollars) in annual sales revenue from overseas markets, according to the 2022 China Gaming Industry Report released recently.The report, released at the China Game Industry Annual Conference in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, shows that Chinese game developers have been actively expanding their business overseas.Due to the downtrend of the global game market under the influence of COVID-19 and heated competition, sales of homegrown Chinese games in the overseas market reached 17.35 billion dollars last year, down 3.7 percent year on year, showing a smaller drop than that of the domestic market.The major target markets for Chineses mobile games are the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea, while the sales in other countries and regions are increasing year by year, indicating the continuous expansion of Chinese enterprises in emerging markets, according to Zhang Yijun, vice chairman of the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association.""Expanding business in overseas markets is becoming a strategic trend for more companies, and the globalization of China´s game industry is becoming increasingly noticeable,"" Zhang said.Chinese internet giant Tencent has been steadily ramping up its efforts to expand its presence in the global gaming market by boosting its technology research and development, fostering content innovation, and building international intellectual property.Many of Tencent´s games have gained popularity worldwide, such as Arena of Valor, PUBG MOBILE and Alchemy Stars. PUBG MOBILE has been released in over 200 countries and regions worldwide, with cumulative global downloads outside the Chinese mainland surpassing 1 billion.Game industry insiders believe that China´s game industry is expanding its global reach through deep localization and refined operations. Chinese enterprises have managed to improve their marketing efficiency by cooperating with overseas distributors and developing integrated research and business models through the establishment or acquisition of overseas studios.To strengthen the company´s global operation and publishing capabilities, Tencent launched its overseas game business brand ""Level Infinite"" at the end of 2021. It provides technical empowerment, market insights, global publishing, and other support for global partners.It currently has a business presence in regions such as Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, and aims to expand its market reach to South America, Latin America and beyond.Regions like the Middle East, Africa and Latin America have become the new areas for growth in the overseas game market for the relatively large populations and rapidly improving network infrastructure, according to the report.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209592.html,18,2,2023
