"UN expert decries ""appalling"" legacy of residential schools in Canada - People's Daily Online","UN expert decries ""appalling"" legacy of residential schools in Canada (Xinhua) 14:41, March 11, 2023People take part in an event to mourn for victims who died of abuses by former indigenous residential schools in Toronto, Canada, on July 1, 2021. (Photo by Zou Zheng/Xinhua)""Canada must address the adverse impact of colonial legacies to achieve meaningful reconciliation and accountability for past crimes,"" said Calí Tzay, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples.OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The testimonies of survivors of Canada´s residential school system were appalling, a United Nations expert said on Friday, urging the government to fully implement recommendations of a 2015 truth commission to achieve meaningful reconciliation and accountability in the country.""Canada must address the adverse impact of colonial legacies to achieve meaningful reconciliation and accountability for past crimes,"" said Calí Tzay, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples, in a statement at the end of a 10-day official visit to Canada.""I was dismayed and saddened by the stories of survivors of Indian Residential Schools,"" the UN expert said.Over 150,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit children were separated from their families and forced to attend the government-funded schools between the 1870s and 1997. In 2015, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission appointed by the Canadian government concluded that children were physically and sexually abused and died in the schools in numbers that may never be fully known.Tzay said the Commission´s Calls to Action should be fully implemented. ""The full resolution of Indian Residential School claims is necessary to achieve true reconciliation, including for Catholic church-run institutions and residential schools established by provinces,"" the UN expert said.Flag marks are seen at the site of unmarked graves near a former indigenous residential school in Saskatchewan, Canada, on June 27, 2021. (Photo by Amru Salahuddien/Xinhua)""Canada has made progress towards the promotion and protection of the rights of Indigenous Peoples since the visits of my predecessors,"" he said, while pointing to many existing challenges that remain unaddressed.""The negative legacies of residential schools are reflected in the child welfare system today. Despite comprising 7.7% of the Canadian population, over 53% of children in care are indigenous, up to 90% in some provinces,"" he said.Tzay said intergenerational trauma caused by residential schools and structural racial discrimination has led to a number of present-day human rights violations and abuses, including the current crisis concerning missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. It is estimated that Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women in Canada.""The number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to increase,"" the expert said. The special rapporteur noted that most of the 231 Calls for Justice of the National Inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) and gender diverse people still remain to be implemented. He called on the Canadian government to prevent and combat such violence as a matter of priority, by addressing the root causes of the MMIWG ""epidemic"", including systemic racism and discrimination against Indigenous women and girls.The special rapporteur also expressed concern that Indigenous Peoples have continued to be overrepresented in the criminal justice system.""The situation of Indigenous women and gender diverse peoples is even more devastating as they represent half of the federal prison population,"" Tzay said. ""Indigenous Peoples are often victims of racial profiling, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, and disproportionate use of force by law enforcement personnel.""People visit a memorial at the site of the former St. Paul Indian Residential School in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on Aug. 10, 2021. (Photo by Liang Sen/Xinhua)Tzay cited the Coastal GasLink pipeline and the Trans Mountain Pipeline projects to illustrate how activities of business corporations further contribute to human rights violations and abuses of Indigenous Peoples in provinces across Canada, including the criminalisation of human rights defenders.""In many cases projects are developed without engaging in good faith consultations with Indigenous Peoples whose rights and interests are impacted, and without their consent,"" the UN expert said. ""International human rights law entails a duty on the part of the State not only to refrain from violating human rights, but to exercise due diligence to prevent and protect individuals from abuse committed by non-State actors, such as business enterprises, including outside their territories,"" he said.The special rapporteur noted that Canada has embarked on an important journey towards reconciliation that must dismantle structural and systemic racism against Indigenous Peoples and respect Indigenous Peoples' right to self-determination, lands, territories, and resources.""Human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent, and all Indigenous Peoples should have equal rights and opportunities,"" the special rapporteur said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220592.html,11,3,2023
Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks (Xinhua) 12:21, March 11, 2023VIENNA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called for advancing open, transparent, inclusive and sustainable intergovernmental discussion at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address the proliferation risks posed by the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation.Li Song, China´s permanent representative to the IAEA, said at a meeting of the agency´s Board of Governors that the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration poses serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation regime, stimulates arms race, and threatens the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.In September 2021, the United States, Britain and Australia announced the AUKUS deal, under which Washington and London will assist Canberra in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. China and many other countries have repeatedly expressed concerns over the transfer of high purity uranium involved in the pact.The essence of the AUKUS cooperation is the transfer of tons of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from the United States and Britain, both nuclear-weapon states and signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to Australia, a non-nuclear-weapon state, Li said.He added such a ""textbook case"" of nuclear proliferation violates NPT´s objectives and principles, and undermines the IAEA´s existing safeguard system and the international non-proliferation regime.He urged the AUKUS countries to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset, fulfill their international obligations and contribute more to regional peace and stability.It is up to all IAEA member states to seek proper solutions through intergovernmental discussions regarding whether and how to conduct safeguards on the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration, as the matter concerns the interests of all the member states and the integrity and effectiveness of the NPT, he said.Stressing that China respects the right of all other member states to express their views, Li said that China firmly opposes any country trying to impose its own views on others.""The U.S., the UK and Australia, while preaching the so-called 'highest non-proliferation standards,' are labeling normal intergovernmental discussions as 'politicized' and rejecting multilateral discussions. Is this what they call the 'rules-based international order?'"" he said.Noting it is essential to keep the intergovernmental discussion going at the IAEA as the AUKUS countries are about to announce concrete plans for their nuclear submarine cooperation, Li said that only true multilateralism can effectively safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation regime.Li called on the IAEA member states to actively participate in the intergovernmental discussion process to help safeguard the global non-proliferation regime.He said he believes IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and the agency´s secretariat will play their due roles in the process and assist the member states in maintaining and advancing the process.He also urged the AUKUS countries not to settle on relevant safeguards arrangements with the IAEA secretariat or start nuclear submarine cooperation before a consensus is reached among the agency´s member states.The AUKUS countries should respond to the international community´s concerns with concrete actions, fulfill their non-proliferation obligations, and maintain candid and transparent communication with other member states on the basis of equality and mutual respect, he added.Representatives from Russia and other developing countries spoke in support of China´s position on the AUKUS issue at the IAEA board meeting. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220521.html,11,3,2023
Interview: China's path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China´s path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist (Xinhua) 11:56, March 11, 2023LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China has blazed a path to modernization that suits its society and harmonizes with the environment, a renowned British sociologist has said.""There are two things (about the Chinese path to modernization) which stand out for me: the scale of the task with such a large population on one side, harmony with nature on the other,"" Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.Albrow said that, given the sheer size of China´s population, the amazing pace of its modernization has greatly impressed him.Harmony between humanity and nature is a theme that goes back millennia into Chinese history, the sociologist said. ""It shows that the emphasis China gives to that means that modernization does not discard the past; it adopts the past and carries the past forward.""""Modernization is congruent with the culture of China itself,"" Albrow said.The Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development, he said.Albrow explained that modernization means applying science and technology to human organizations.""On the back of the development of modern technologies, modernization allows countries to take their own culture forward,"" he said. ""Every country is able to develop modernity in the way that suits its own culture.""""China has given an example to the world of how you can have a culturally-led modernization program,"" he added.Albrow, author of the book China and the Shared Human Future: Exploring Common Values and Goals, said that as the world turns its attention to the ongoing ""two sessions"" held in Beijing, it´s important for China to demonstrate that ""democracy comes in many different forms"" and that ""China is moving forward all the time.""The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual meetings of the National People´s Congress, the country´s national legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.""The Chinese version of democracy is one which enlists the support of the whole population, through the efforts of the Communist Party of China to produce a coherent approach to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""China´s form of democracy is an evolving form of discussion and debate, but one which is built upon the consensus of society as a whole.""""It´s a profound kind of democracy and very different from the kinds which exist in so many Western countries, the kinds of democracies that exist, for instance, (in) the United Kingdom or the United States, ones which tend to produce disagreements"" and make it difficult for a country to take any single path into the future, despite its continual debate and discussion about how to go forward, according to Albrow.""Democracy is not a stable condition; democracy is something which is continually moving forward,"" he continued, adding that ""China is in a position now, in this particular 'two sessions', to take us forward again, with well-judged reforms of its own system.""Albrow is confident in the CPC´s resolve to further reforms that will remove institutional obstacles to fulfill Chinese modernization. Over the past decades, the CPC has shown the courage to develop and introduce changes and reforms, he said. ""I have no reason to think it can't do it in the future."" ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220509.html,11,3,2023
"Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases - People's Daily Online","Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases (Xinhua) 12:07, March 11, 2023BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing ""two sessions"" in Beijing hold great significance not only for China´s own development but also for other nations interested in understanding China´s future growth trajectory and global impact.The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual sessions of China´s National People´s Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which are the country´s top legislature and national political advisory body, respectively.China´s opening-up policy remains one of the most discussed topics at the political event this year. The government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation demonstrates the steady progress and China´s impressive determination on the policy, saying that ""We remained committed to opening up wider to the world and expanded international economic and trade cooperation to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes.""As an Egyptian living in China for years, I have witnessed the country´s wider opening-up pursuit, and I believe an open China is vital to the struggling global economic recovery.STORIES BEHIND ""THINNER"" SUITCASESI have friends of different nationalities who share the same feeling that our suitcases are ""thinner"" these days when returning to China from holidays. Over a decade ago, my family would always stuff my suitcase with cheese, dates, spices and other local specialties before I returned to China.Now, however, more global products are entering the Chinese market through platforms such as the China International Import Expo (CIIE). With Arab specialties including Egyptian oranges, dates from the United Arab Emirates and essential oils from Syria easily available in Chinese supermarkets, I no longer need to carry these things all the way to China.According to the government work report, China developed new forms of foreign trade over the past five years and built 152 new integrated pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce. Major trade events such as CIIE, the China Import and Export Fair, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the China International Consumer Products Expo have delivered positive results.Furthermore, China simplified customs clearance procedures and reduced the clearance time for imports and exports by 67 percent and 92 percent, respectively, bringing about a significant reduction in related compliance costs, the work report added.Amidst the growing trend of trade protectionism and the so-called ""decoupling and severing industrial and supply chains"" by some developed countries, China´s efforts toward trade liberalization and facilitation have become increasingly crucial.With an enormous market of more than 1.4 billion people, China is the world´s largest goods trader, a major trading partner of over 140 countries and regions, and has the world´s second-largest consumer market and import market. There is no doubt that China is a key hub of the global economic cycle, benefiting the entire world with the dividends of its super-sized market.STRONG MAGNET FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT""Intensifying efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment,"" as stated in the government work report, is one of the key priorities of the Chinese government´s economic work in 2023.During my over a decade-long experience of living in China, I have seen an increasing number of international companies investing in the country. When enterprises first entered China, most of them just regarded it as the ""factory of the world."" But later many of these companies set up research and development centers here to continuously increase the added value of their industrial chains.In 2022, foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 8 percent year on year to 189.13 billion U.S. dollars, reinforcing its status as a magnet for foreign investors.Among Arab countries, Gulf countries' investment in China is particularly eye-catching. Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Kuwait National Petroleum Company and other energy giants have carried out in-depth investment cooperation with many Chinese provinces and enterprises.China and Arab countries have adhered to pursuing mutual benefits, promoted trade and investment facilitation, and multiplied the growth of mutual investment and economic and trade cooperation, according to the Saudi Arabian newspaper Alriyadh.The sovereign wealth funds of Gulf states have long been mainly invested in developed markets in Europe and the United States. In recent years, as China-Arab relations have continued to improve and their economic ties deepened, China´s market and assets are gradually favored by sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.In 2018, Abu Dhabi Global Market, an international financial center in Abu Dhabi, opened its first overseas representative office in Beijing.Ajlan &Bros Holding Group, a leading investment holding company in the Middle East and one of the largest private enterprises of Saudi Arabia in China, has been doing business in China for more than 20 years. With the increasingly close economic and trade exchanges between China and Saudi Arabia, the company has set up four investment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong since 2017.Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) has jumped onto the bandwagon of China´s green development. The company announced a carbon-neutral strategy and plans to actively expand investment cooperation in China.""We need to 'join hands' with each other instead of 'letting go' of each other´s hands. We need to 'tear down walls,' not 'erect walls.'"" I was deeply impressed by these inspiring words by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and I believe China walks its talk.A sentence in the government work report fully expresses China´s confidence in attracting more foreign investment, saying that with a vast and open market, China is sure to provide even greater business opportunities for foreign companies in China.MORE FRIENDS, MORE CHANCESThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has attracted more than three-quarters of the world´s countries and 32 international organizations.Over the past decade, Chinese companies have invested 397.9 billion yuan (about 57 billion U.S. dollars) in cooperation zones built in countries along the Belt and Road, creating 421,000 local jobs.The BRI has made significant contributions to Egypt´s modernization process and a notable example is the country´s new administrative capital.A modern city is taking shape in the desert east of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. Constructed by a Chinese company, the Central Business District (CBD) in Egypt´s new administrative capital boasts the tallest building in Africa, standing at 385.8 meters.This achievement is a testament to the growing friendship between Egypt and China. The project is nearing completion within just over four years. According to Egypt´s Al-Ahram newspaper, ""China speed"" makes Egypt´s dream come true.From material selection to the application of technologies, the project embodies the concept of green development and can help Cairo effectively deal with air pollution and other ""big city diseases.""The CBD in Egypt´s new administrative capital has become a popular spot, bustling with visitors. I would go there every time I go back to Egypt.The outcomes of high-quality BRI development are spread across Africa. I have experienced the Chinese-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway. From the station to the trains, I was struck by the modern scene around me. Passengers were enjoying the convenience and efficiency of the self-service ticket vending machines, while the crew provided excellent services.China´s high-level opening-up has been a continuous success, and the BRI has become an international public good and a platform for international cooperation, Karim Adel, head of the Cairo-based Al Adl Center for Economic and Strategic Studies, told Xinhua.China´s other initiatives, especially the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, have also won the support of many countries, Adel added.Last year, I had the privilege of participating in the translation and review work of the Arabic version of the fourth volume of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China."" With every word I read, I gained a deeper appreciation for the thoughts of the Chinese leader.In 2021, Xi said that on the road to the well-being of all humankind, no country or nation should be left behind. All countries and nations are equally entitled to development opportunities and rights to development, Xi said at the Communist Party of China and World Political Parties Summit. His words deeply touched me.There is an Arabic proverb that goes, ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together,"" just like how in China people often say ""more friends, more chances.""China is a country committed to high-level opening-up and I firmly believe that its efforts will bring more concrete opportunities to the world. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220517.html,11,3,2023
U.S. regulators close Silicon Valley Bank - People's Daily Online,"U.S. regulators close Silicon Valley Bank (Xinhua) 14:06, March 11, 2023SAN FRANCISCO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the 16th largest bank in the United States, was closed on Friday by regulators, according to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).An FDIC memo released on Friday said the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed the bank after its stocks sputtered. The bank´s operations will resume on Monday with the FDIC in charge.All insured depositors will have ""full access"" to ""insured"" deposits no later than Monday morning, and official checks ""will continue to clear,"" said the FDIC.Deposit insurance, as per the FDIC´s definition, means that deposits are insured up to 250,000 U.S. dollars per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.The move came after the Santa Clara-headquartered bank announced Wednesday that it lost 1.8 billion dollars in the sale of U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it had invested in, owing to rising interest rates. The bank was also facing shrinking deposits as the tech industry struggled.Panic ensued, leading the share price to tank sharply and triggering the run on the 40-year-old bank that holds 210 billion dollars in assets.The SVB´s failure is the largest bank failure since the collapse of U.S. savings and loan association Washington Mutual in 2008, The Associated Press reported.More than half of the bank´s current loans went to major venture capital and private equity firms, while another quarter went to tech and life sciences companies.The bank has an estimated 6,500 employees, according to U.S. online newspaper TechCrunch. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220581.html,11,3,2023
"US, a self-proclaimed human rights defender, fails to protect its children - People's Daily Online","US, a self-proclaimed human rights defender, fails to protect its childrenBy Chen Zi (People´s Daily Online) 17:08, March 10, 2023(Cartoon by Tan Xiguang)Touting itself as a ""human rights defender"", the United States has wantonly pointed fingers at the human rights situations in other countries. Human rights protection is a pretense of the U.S., which covers a ""black hole"" of the human rights situation in the U.S.The U.S. Department of Labor announced that it found that Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI), one of the nation’s largest food safety sanitation services providers, employed over 100 children in hazardous occupations, and had them working overnight shifts at meat processing facilities. The minors were working with hazardous chemicals and cleaning meat processing equipment, and suffered injuries while working for PSSI.Child labor is a chronic illness of U.S. society. The country has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child yet, and has been criticized by the International Labor Organization many times. The Guardian reported that child labor law violations have increased in the U.S., with a 37 percent increase in fiscal year 2022, including 688 children working in hazardous conditions. Estimates by the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs suggest that there are 500,000 to 800,000 child farmworkers in the U.S. These facts are a sharp reminder that the U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, can hardly protect the legitimate rights of children. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10220276.html,10,3,2023

Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? - People's Daily Online,"Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? (Xinhua) 11:01, March 11, 2023-- ""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.-- China always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.-- The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For a long time in history, the world was shrouded in the myth that modernization equals Westernization. The emergence of Chinese modernization dispels it, making modernization no longer a single-choice question, but a multiple-choice one.For the world, China´s task to modernize a country of 1.4 billion people, or nearly one-fifth of the global population, is unprecedented. The Herculean pursuit not only captures global attention, but also has global ramifications.Among a series of concepts and initiatives that China promotes in both state governance and global interactions, the Chinese path to modernization is the most popular keyword that people would like to know more about, according to an overseas survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency recently.WHAT ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHINESE AND WESTERN MODERNIZATION?China´s path to modernization is one of peace and development, win-win cooperation, and harmony between humanity and nature, rather than external expansion and plundering.""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.""The modernization of a small number of Western countries was based on the exploitation, oppression and colonization of almost the entire world. China is not developing by exploiting any other country; China is developing itself and modernizing itself, and at the same time helping other countries to develop and modernize,"" he said.China does not seek to exploit or control other nations, and it plays no role in inciting conflicts, said Mokhtar Gobashy, deputy chairman of the Cairo-based Arab Center for Political and Strategic Studies, adding that´s why China has gained respect and popularity in the Arab world.Meanwhile, Chinese modernization emphasizes both material and cultural-ethical advancement, which distinguishes it from Western modernization, said Chen Gang, assistant director of the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore.The coordination of material and cultural-ethical advancement leads the way to realize all-around material abundance as well as people´s well-rounded development, Chen said.WHAT CHINESE MODERNIZATION CAN OFFER FOR THE WORLD?China stands in the world as the second-largest economy and a responsible major country. It always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.Firstly, China is committed to making the world less poor and more equitable.By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.Commenting on China´s poverty reduction drive, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said those achievements are ""the biggest contribution for dramatical reduction of poverty.""More than eradicating absolute poverty, Chinese modernization promotes common prosperity, thereby shrinking the enormous wealth gap and inequality that have risen in tandem with Western modernization.British scholar and political commentator Martin Jacques highlighted China´s pursuit of common prosperity, lamenting how Western countries have never taken it seriously.""For China to embrace common prosperity, to establish a society of greater fairness, greater equity, that is a very important message not only to China, Chinese people but to the world as well,"" he said.China, on its way toward modernization, has also been sharing its development dividends with the rest of the world.Take the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to a World Bank forecast, if all Belt and Road transport infrastructure projects are carried out, the initiative would generate 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars of global revenues annually to 2030. Up to 90 percent of the revenues would go to partner countries.""The most important thing about the BRI is that developing nations could benefit from the great experience in the development of China. BRI gives them the opportunity to create an industrial society and join the modern age. This is something that in the long run would bode well for the future of humanity,"" said Khairy Tourk, professor of economics with the Stuart School of Business at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.Secondly, China is committed to making the world greener and more biodiverse.China ranks first globally in the area of planted forests and forest coverage growth, contributing a quarter of the world´s new forest area in the past decade.From 2012 to 2021, China´s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP declined by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal.So far, China has also emerged as a major proponent of renewable energy, and it is working hard to capitalize on the potential of a green BRI.UNFCCC (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Executive Secretary Simon Stiell spoke highly of China´s firm and consistent stance on actively addressing climate change, as well as its efforts to translate climate commitments into concrete actions.At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis, China continues to make solid progress in dealing with climate change and plays an important role in advancing the global response to climate change, Stiell said.Meanwhile, under China´s presidency, the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the global biodiversity framework ahead of schedule. China has shown leadership in global biodiversity protection, Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, has said.Thirdly, China is committed to making the world more peaceful.For more than 70 years, China has never started a war, never occupied a single square mile of foreign territory, never engaged in proxy wars, and never been a member of or organized any military bloc.It is the only country that has incorporated peaceful development in its Constitution, and the only country among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge no first use of nuclear weapons. China´s track record on peace can stand the scrutiny of history, and its peaceful rise is an unprecedented miracle in human history.Since China´s restoration of its lawful seat at the United Nations in 1971, China has actively participated in the political settlement of major regional hot issues, including the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and the Palestine-Israel issue.In response to mounting conflicts and security challenges in today´s world, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022.And in the GSI Concept Paper released last month, China further expounded the core ideas and principles of the initiative, identified the priorities, platforms and mechanisms of cooperation and demonstrated China´s sense of responsibility for safeguarding world peace and firm resolve to defend global security.""China´s idea of being a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods are consistent with the ideals of the UN Charter,"" former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said.People visit Jianchang ancient city during the Spring Festival holiday in Xichang, southwest China´s Sichuan Province, on Jan. 27, 2023.
