CNN was unable to specifically geolocate the video but doesn't have a reason to believe the footage is not from Bakhmut. ""The other day, the border unit of the Luhansk detachment conducted a positional battle with enemy forces in the area of one of the industrial enterprises,"" the Border Guard said in a statement. ""The day before, the Ukrainian defenders withstood several assault attacks of the invaders."" ""To continue the offensive, the Russian mercenaries entrenched themselves in one of the workshops and gathered strength,"" the Border Guard said, adding that at this point the guards launched a counterattack.A Ukrainian grenade unit was able to take down the machine gunner who was covering the entrance to the building. Then, a ground reconnaissance group of border guards were able to move in and ""eliminated the Wagnerites,"" the Border Guard said.CNN is unable to independently verify how the events unfolded. The Border Guard doesn't say what day the video was recorded. ""To destroy the enemy's reserve, the border guards set up an ambush. With the onset of darkness, a surprise awaited the attack squads who were approaching the front line. Border snipers neutralized six invaders,"" the Border Guard said. Part of the video appears to show the moment described in the statement. The video also features a few comments from one of the Ukrainian soldiers. ""About the situation in Bakhmut — they have already entered the industrial zone. We try to kick them out of there. They strengthened their positions there last night. My reconnaissance group entered their location this morning and is trying to attack their positions,"" the soldier said. Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said on national television Saturday that over the last 24 hours, more than 20 combat engagements between Ukrainian and Russian forces have taken place within the territory of the city itself. Cherevatyi also said most of the Russian assault groups consist of Wagner fighters who are reinforced by Russian paratroopers.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link57 min agoSpring brings hope in Kharkiv after a long, dark winter for UkrainiansFrom CNN’s Saskya Vandoorne and Maria Avdeeva in KharkivMiris.  (Saskya Vandoorn/CNN)Most of the power supply in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was restored Saturday after a barrage of Russian drones and missiles targeted critical infrastructure and plunged the city into darkness yet again Thursday.Miris, an 18-year-old resident of the city, says “spring brings hope” after a dark winter.She smiled as she froths a cappuccino in a coffee shop with no generator.“I was depressed because the blackouts meant I couldn’t do the things I normally do,” Miris told CNN. But she’s learned to adapt, and when there’s no electricity, she trades in her favorite TV show for a book.“I’ve had a whole year to get used to this kind of living.

But it added that Ukrainian forces still hold the west of Bakhmut and have made it difficult for Russian-aligned troops to move forward — even turning one strip of open ground into a ""killing zone.""share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link4 hr 26 min agoRussian paratroopers are reinforcing Wagner fighters in Bakhmut attacks, Ukrainian military spokesperson saysFrom CNN's Radina Gigova and Kostan NechyporenkoAs Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut continue, there have been more than 50 combat engagements between Ukrainian and Russian forces over the last 24 hours in the area, according to a Ukrainian military spokesperson. ""The enemy was actively conducting combat operations all week, just like the previous week. Yesterday was no exception,"" said Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, on national television Saturday. ""Over the last 24 hours, the enemy attacked our positions in the Bakhmut sector 157 times with artillery and multiple rocket launchers.""Cherevatyi said Bakhmut itself was attacked 16 times, and 23 combat engagements took place within the city itself.When asked which Russian units are leading the attacks on Bakhmut, and whether the tactics of the Russian forces have changed, Cherevatyi said most of the assault groups consist of Wagner fighters who are reinforced by Russian paratroopers. ""The Wagner PMC has not been destroyed, we are only on the way to (achieving that),"" he said. On Friday, Cherevatyi said a third wave of fighters from the Wagner private military company fighting in the area are being replaced by Russia's regular army.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link4 hr 29 min agoZelensky calls Finland's prime minister ""a defender of a free Europe"" after talks in KyivFrom CNN's Radina GigovaFinland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hold a joint press conference in Kyiv, on March 10.

Rescuers, medics and police were working at the scene.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link1 hr 49 min agoThe head of Wagner says his group is fighting to make sure there is no ""disgrace"" of RussiaFrom CNN’s Uliana Pavlova, Radina Gigova and Nathan Hodgeegeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, said in a video published Saturday that his fighters have one ""simple"" goal -- not to allow the ""disgrace"" of Russia at the hands of Western governments. “What is our goal? Why are we fighting? The goal is simple. To not disgrace Russian weapons, to not disgrace Russia,” Prigozhin said in the video message published on Telegram. “Not to bring Russia to the point where it collapses itself."" Progozhin continued:""Most likely this is the goal of the American, British intelligence services, which work for the long haul and work to destroy Russia, in which the ruler must continue losing ratings, the army must become weaker and weaker until the Russians say: 'what the heck is our self-consciousness?' Let us be ruled,” he said.Though Prigozhin was a shadowy figure before Russia's war in Ukraine, he has become an increasingly public presence as Wagner forces have gotten more involved in the conflict. After Russia’s military suffered humiliating setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine, Prigozhin -- a canny political entrepreneur without any official government position -- began openly taking credit for Wagner’s efforts to secure some territorial gains, particularly in the battles raging around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. His unexpected rise prompted speculation about possible elite infighting in Moscow as Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine sputtered.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden PresidencyFacts First2022 MidtermsBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoMorePhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2022 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.

Video Ad FeedbackUkraine reels from massive Russian strikes    08:14   - Source:CNNCNN      Russia’s overnight missile attack on Thursday showered Ukraine with an array of missiles, in one of Moscow’s biggest aerial assaults for months.  Nearly half a million people are without power in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, following the latest barrage of strikes, according to the regional governor.  And there are concerns about how effectively Ukraine can stand up to such bombardments.  “They’re sending a very strong signal to everyone in Ukraine, and to perhaps some of our refugees outside of Ukraine, that life is very far from returning to normal despite the fact that over recent weeks there was more quiet,” Alexander Rodnyansky, an economic adviser to Zelensky, told CNN.

(AP Photo/Vadim Belikov)Vadim Belikov/APRussia pummels Ukraine with array of high-tech weaponry in nationwide assaultBut aerial strikes like these are not going to win Russia the war, Western experts say.  “There is a long history of nations trying to win wars through strategic bombardment, to break the will or capacity of an opposing state to resist,” Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for airpower and technology at the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, told CNN. “It has an incredibly poor record of success.”  Russia’s limited stockpiles mean it’s unlikely they will force a major breakthrough in the war through the skies, so long as its air force is unable to gain supremacy above Ukraine.  Here’s what you need to know about Russia’s latest missile attacks, and what they mean for the conflict.What missiles are Russia using?Russia launched a total of 95 missiles of various types over the past day, 34 of which were intercepted, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a morning update on Friday, as well as a number of Iranian-made Shahed drones.  That array included cruise missiles that were launched from both the sea and the air; six different kinds were used in the early hours of Thursday morning, according to Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.  Much attention has been focused on the six launches of Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles, which are especially difficult to stop.  The powerful weapon has rarely been seen over the country’s skies. Its first known use in Ukraine was last March and occasionally used since, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).   Like virtually all ballistic missiles it is hypersonic, which means it travels at least five times the speed of sound, but it is also particularly difficult to detect because it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions, and because it can maneuver as it nears its target.Is this a new strategy?The use of so many different weapons systems in one night has increasingly become Russia’s preferred method of striking through the skies.  “Over the last six months or so there’s been a trend towards larger gaps between missile raids, but more missiles used at once when they do, to make it harder for defenses to intercept them all,” Bronk said.  That shift has come as Ukraine’s air defenses have become better equipped and more advanced, and as a way of maximizing the impact of each wave of strikes.  Maksym KozytskyiRussia's war in Ukraine“Moscow looks to have been adapting its missile attacks to further complicate the challenge for defenders, with a mix of subsonic cruise missiles, the much higher speed Kinzhal aero-ballistic missiles, and possibly also decoys and other counter-measures,” Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said.  The use of hypersonic missiles in particular follows the Kremlin’s years-long push to equip its military with such weaponry – a move that the United States and the West has been less keen to adopt, given the trade-offs in pursuing hypersonic capabilities.  “What you get is a missile that is much harder to intercept and gives your opponent much less warning. What you lose is that it’s much more expensive, and often can only be carried by a much more limited number of platforms,” Bronk explained.How effective are Ukraine’s air defenses?Ukraine’s air defense systems did not stand up well enough against Russia’s nuclear-capable Kinzhal missiles, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky said following Thursday’s missile barrage.  “They are using hypersonic missiles. They are using new types of weapons and they are seeing how our air defense systems can cope with it,” Rodnyansky told CNN’s Isa Soares in an interview, adding, “they are not coping well enough.”   Ukraine has adapted to new Russian aerial bombardments in the past, improving their ability to shoot down incoming cruise missiles with surface-to-air defenses and seeing particularly high levels of success against Shahed drones.  “They’ve seen a lot of the potential patterns in terms of routes and the way the Russians plan their missile salvos, so they’ve got better at positioning their air defense teams,” Bronk said. Ukraine’s command and control, and its ability to track incoming strikes – often with the help of Ukrainians via an app – has also grown, he added.  A plume of smoke rises on Thursday morning after Russia launched strikes at Ukraine in the early hours.TwitterBut the Kinzhal provides a specific challenge: It is immune to Ukraine’s air defenses. An air-launched variant of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) which has also, more frequently, been used in Ukraine, the Kinzhal was unveiled by Putin in 2018 as a cornerstone of a modernized Russian arsenal.  “Russia likely developed the unique missile to more easily target critical European infrastructure … (its) speed, in combination with the missile’s erratic flight trajectory and high maneuverability, could complicate interception,” according to a CSIS report.How much firepower does Russia have left?While Russia has deployed a handful of missiles that Ukraine is currently unable to stop, it appears unlikely that such attacks will become a regular or decisive feature of the conflict – because, by most Western assessments, Russia is running low on supplies.  Ihnat said that Russia had about 50 Kinzhals to draw upon, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted, meaning it used a significant proportion in one night.  “The Kremlin likely deliberately launched missiles that Ukrainian air defenses cannot intercept to achieve results within the Russian information space despite the dwindling supplies of such missiles,” the ISW wrote in its latest assessment of the conflict, adding that Vladimir Putin “likely used these scarce missiles in fruitless attacks to appease the Russian pro-war and ultranationalist communities.”  “The Russians are getting low on missiles and yet they continue to fire them,” Bronk added, explaining that Moscow can produce somewhere around 40 cruise missiles each month.  Bronk said Moscow appears comfortable running down supplies that would have been theoretically preserved for an attack on Russian soil. But now they are also “getting to a point where they are really low on certain missile types in absolute terms,” he said.  Rescuers carry a body after Russian strikes hit Lviv on Thursday.State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Lviv region via Reuters    Why is Moscow attacking the entire country?The benefits to Russia in using scant supplies in aerial bombardments appears limited, and seems unlikely to shift momentum in the war – particularly given that Ukraine is through the worst of what turned out to be a mild winter, when Putin had hoped that attacks on energy and electricity supplies would break morale.  “It’s very damaging for Ukraine, but is it likely to cause them to lose the ability to keep fighting the war? No, absolutely not,” Bronk said, assessing the use of such strikes.  But the use of a frustrating if ultimately fruitless tactic is not out of character for a disjointed Russian war effort.  “They don’t really have any military plan beyond outlasting the West’s ability to support the Ukrainian military,” Bronk said. “In other words, just avoid losing on the battlefield for long enough that the West gets tired of supporting them.”   In that context, the strikes serve as a psychological reminder of Russia’s military threat without shifting the balance of the war.  And Putin may foremost be playing to a domestic audience with the strikes, as the ISW suggested, amid growing complaints among Russia’s hawkish military community that his commanders have been too “soft” or ineffective in Ukraine and have struggled to land lasting blows.  “Putin likely attempted to offset these narratives with another missile attack similar to the ones that Russia conducted in the fall of 2022, using advanced missiles to guarantee some damage in Ukraine,” the ISW wrote.

Sign up here.Abu Dhabi, UAECNN      Saudi Arabia and Iran announced on Friday that they had agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of hostility, in a deal between the regional archrivals that could have wide-ranging implications for the Middle East.   Riyadh and Tehran plan to reopen their embassies within two months in an agreement mediated by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran said in a joint statement after talks in Beijing on Friday.    They also plan to reimplement a security pact signed 22 years ago under which both parties agreed to cooperate on terrorism, drug-smuggling and money-laundering, as well as reviving a trade and technology deal from 1998.   Friday’s announcement is also a diplomatic victory for China in a Gulf region that has long been considered part of the US’ domain of influence. It comes as the Biden administration tries to notch its own win in the Middle East by trying to broker a normalization pact between Israel and Saudi Arabia.   Talks had been ongoing since March 6 in Beijing between Iranian national security chief Ali Shamkhani, Saudi national security council adviser Mosaed Bin Mohammad Al-Aiban and China’s top diplomat Wang Yi, according to Iranian state media.   Video of the signing ceremony aired by Iranian media showed officials seated around tables on opposite sides with the Saudi Arabian, Iranian and Chinese flags around them.

In an apparent push back to American influence, Wang said that “the world is not limited to the Ukraine issue” while emphasizing that the fate of the Middle East should be determined by the people of the Middle East.   “The foreign ministers of the two countries will meet each other to implement this decision and make necessary arrangements for the exchange of ambassadors,” the joint statement said. “The two sides agree to respect the sovereignty and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.”     Saudi Arabia and Iran had previously held talks aimed at reconciliation in Oman and Iraq.   Riyadh severed ties with Tehran in 2016 after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in the Iranian capital following the execution of a Shi’ite cleric in Saudi Arabia. Since then, they have fought a proxy war that has embroiled a number of neighboring countries, bringing the region ever closer to war.   In Yemen, the two countries have supported opposite sides of a civil war that has been described by the United Nations as one the world’s worst humanitarian crises. From there, the Houthi rebels have fired missiles at both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, targeting oil infrastructure that is vital to their economies.    Saudi Arabia has however been engaged in direct talks with the Houthis, and an unofficial ceasefire appears to be holding.   In a speech prior to the signing of the agreement with his Iranian counterpart, Saudi Arabia’s Al-Aiban called for non-interference in the sovereignty of states to be a “fundamental pillar for the development of relations.”  “We value what we have reached and we hope that we will continue the constructive dialogue, in accordance with the pillars and foundations included in the agreement,” he said.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian hailed the deal and said Tehran would step up its diplomatic efforts in the region.    “Iran and Saudi Arabia relations returning to normal makes the two countries, the region and the Muslim world stronger,” Amir-Abdollahian tweeted on Friday.   Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated on the global stage. Talks to revive Iran’s 2015 nuclear pact with world powers are frozen and relations with Western states have faced further strains due to the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on protests that started in September.   Iran’s main international ally Russia is preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, while China, its other ally, has lately been courting Tehran’s archrival Saudi Arabia.

In December, Chinese President Xi Jinping was welcomed in Riyadh in an extravagant ceremony as part of a visit that brought together 14 Arab heads of state. That was just months after a relatively low-key meeting with US President Joe Biden, whose relationship with Saudi Arabia has been frosty.“China’s role as a broker is striking, and could foreshadow a bolder diplomatic position,” said Sanam Vakil, a senior research fellow for the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House think-tank in London.    “But we should be cautious in overstating Beijing’s intentions. This is more about China’s interests in the region. China has brought together two key actors – regional and economic actors –  for the purpose of reducing regional tensions and facilitating greater economic engagement with both.”   Xiaofei Xu, Shawn Deng and Abbas Al Lawati contributed to this report.

A man holds Moldovan national flag as special police officers patrol a street near a polling station during the second round of Moldova's presidential election in the town of Varnita.Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty ImagesWashingtonCNN      The US intelligence community believes that individuals with ties to Russian intelligence are planning to stage protests in Moldova to try to foment a manufactured insurrection against the Moldovan government, with the ultimate goal of seeing a more pro-Russia administration installed there, White House officials said Friday.   The US believes that Russia is working to weaken the Moldovan government which is seeking closer ties with the European Union, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said, The US is also seeing signs that Russian government-linked actors could provide training to anti-government demonstrators in Moldova. The country’s capital, Chisinau, has been rocked by anti-government protests in recent weeks, largely organized by Moldova’s Russia-friendly Shor Party.   The Biden administraiton also believes that Moscow is working to sow disinformation about Moldova’s overall stability. One example was the Russian Ministry of Defense’s claim last month that Ukraine has been planning to invade Transnistria, Moldova’s Moscow-backed separatist region. US officials said those allegations are “unfounded, false, and create baseless alarm.”   Moldova’s President, Maia Sandu, said publicly last month that she believes the Russian government was planning “a series of actions involving saboteurs who have undergone military training and are disguised as civilians to carry out violent actions, attacks on government buildings and hostage-taking.”  TOPSHOT - People take part in a protest against the Moldovan Government and their pro-EU President in Chisinau on February 19, 2023. - A couple of thousands of protesters gathered in downtown Chisinau answering the call made by ""SOR"" Party, as tension run high in pro-Western Moldova after allegations of Moscow's attempts to destabilise the country came to light last week. Facing multiple crises aggravated by Russia's war in Ukraine, the impoverished former Soviet republic of 2.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova is already wrestling with an energy crisis prompted by supply cuts from Russia's targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, and tensions have flared up due to missile overflights connected to the war in Ukraine.

But the US has been watching Russia’s activities in Moldova closely, wary of Russia’s ongoing efforts to destabilize Europe. President Joe Biden met with Sandu last month in Warsaw, where they discussed Russian malign influence activities.   The US is declassifying this intelligence now in an effort to deter Russia from moving froward with its plans, the officials said, similar to how the US has been regularly declassifying intelligence about Russia’s intentions in Ukraine with the aim of exposing their plans.  The administration sanctioned nine individuals and 12 entities in October that the US believed to be involved in working to destabilize Moldova, including oligarchs “widely recognized for capturing and corrupting Moldova’s political and economic institutions and those acting as instruments of Russia’s global influence campaign,” the US Treasury Department said in a statement at the time.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Sandu at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February and voiced “deep concern” about efforts by Russia to destabilize the Moldovan government.  “We stand strongly with Moldova in support of its security, its independence, its territorial integrity, the very important reform efforts that the president and the government are making,” Blinken said. “At the same time, we have deep concern about some of the plotting that we’ve seen coming from Russia to try to destabilize the government, but appreciate, of course, the efforts that – the good efforts being made by Moldova to protect against that.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

US President Joe Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Friday, March 3, 2023. Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesCNN      President Joe Biden hoped to ease a serious source of tension with Europe when he met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the White House on Friday.  The dispute is technical but highly contentious. It comes at a moment – a year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – when unity between the US and its European allies is already being tested.  The quarrel centers on a provision of Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act that offered tax credits for electric vehicles. The law specifies in order to qualify for the credit, the vehicles must source a percentage of the material for their batteries from North America or countries with a free trade agreement with the US – which the EU does not.  The law has infuriated some of the United States’ top allies, like the EU, who say their countries are being penalized. The timing is inopportune, as Biden works to maintain transatlantic unity as the war in Ukraine enters a second year.  In their talks in the Oval Office on Friday, Biden and von der Leyen discussed the matter and announced a new set of negotiations that, if successful, would allow European companies to benefit from the Biden law and reduce both US and EU dependence on China.  “We have agreed that we will start work now with the clear goal: The goal is to have an agreement on critical raw materials that have been sourced or processed in the European Union, that these strategic supply chains are able to access the American market as if they had been sourced in the United States,” von der Leyen said outside the White House after the meeting concluded.  The two leaders also discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, including plans to deepen cooperation on enforcing sanctions against Russia and third-party countries who are supporting Moscow’s invasion. That could soon include China, which US officials have warned is considering providing lethal aid to Russia.  Yet it is the transatlantic economic issues that formed the center of the talks, particularly the disagreement over Biden’s climate law, which European officials have slammed as protectionist.   The agreement the two leaders announced centered on the critical minerals that are necessary for electric vehicle batteries, perhaps unlocking for Europe some of the Inflation Reduction Act’s benefits.  “I look forward to talking about all that with you,” Biden said at the meeting got underway in the Oval Office.   “We’re driving new investments to create clean energy industries and jobs and make sure we have supply chains available to both our continents,” Biden said as the meeting got underway in the Oval Office. “That idea underpins our Inflation Reduction Act, and it lies at the heart of the your green deal industrial plan for the EU, and so I hope we can talk about that today.”  If not resolved, the issue could potentially spiral into competing subsidies that neither side wants, and add to strains caused by the war in Ukraine.  “What we want to do is maximize the amount of deployment, maximize the speed of that deployment, and do so in a way that builds each of our respective industrial bases. That isn’t going to happen if our incentives and their incentives are misaligned, and compete with one another in a zero sum way,” a senior US administration official said ahead of the meeting.  After Biden signed the law last year, European allies reacted harshly, setting off a scramble within the administration to resolve the issues while not angering members of Congress who supported the Made-in-America aspects of the law.  Among the top proponents of the measure: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat whose support is critical for the White House on a number of issues.  Biden’s meeting Friday won’t completely resolve the matter, according to officials, but instead launch a process of arriving at a type of trade agreement that would meet the law’s requirements and allow European companies to help supply battery materials – like lithium and nickel – for electric vehicles.  US officials have been in similar discussions with counterparts from the United Kingdom and Japan to assuage those nations’ similar concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act.  It’s unclear how long the process might take.  “The goal here is to ensure that as we make our investments, as Europe make its investments, that our approaches are communicated, that we’re communicating with one another on our approaches so that we maximize the deployment of clean energy technology over time, and not that those incentives compete with one another,” the official said.

As the crowd of protesters grew larger and larger, riot police gathered at their flanks. All hell broke loose.  Will CathcartWill CathcartThe riot police fired tear gas canisters into the crowd. They used batons and water cannons. The images were remarkable. In one, a woman waving a European Union flag takes on a fire hose — an apt metaphor for Georgian democracy.    By Thursday morning those protests had proved a success. The ruling party retracted its “foreign influence” bill, which would have required organizations receiving 20% or more of their annual income from abroad to register as “foreign agents” or face heavy fines.  Though after all the duplicitous justifications they gave for passing it in the first place, the move feels cynical at best. A similar law has been used to dismantle independent media and NGOs in Russia since 2012.   But Thursday was a reminder that the Georgian people have the power to reclaim their democracy. (That’s even if the ruling party ends up finding other rights to take away from its people in its desperate attempt not to lose in the upcoming 2024 parliamentary elections.)  In the past several years, it appears that the Georgian government has been intentionally subverting its democracy in order to leave the EU and NATO with no choice but to reject it. Which is exactly how Moscow likes it.

(Photo by David Mdzinarishvili/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)David Mdzinarishvili/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesGeorgia's parliament formally revokes 'foreign influence' bill that sparked major protestsThe Georgian people have fought back at every turn. Whether it is about their government’s refusal to support Ukraine, raids on nightclubs or attacks on journalists covering LGBTQ demonstrations, thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets.  The circumstances for these protests are always different. But the reason is always the same. Georgia’s ruling party is turning toward Moscow. Its people are not. The men, women and children who gather before Parliament are essentially sending a message: “We are Europe. If you intend to take away our democracy, you must first come through us.”  Georgians shouldn’t have to get beaten in the streets to exercise their democracy. But they will. Georgia’s informal ruler, the oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, is miscalculating his people just as Russian President Vladimir Putin underestimated the Ukrainian people.  It may sound trite to compare those protesting a bill in front of the Georgian Parliament to the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the slush and mud that was once a city called Bakhmut. But these fighters share what they see as a common enemy, and both know what is at stake.   As a journalist living here in Tbilisi for the last 15 years, one gets used to the tear gas. Despite having a chronic lung disease, or more likely on account of it, I get a strange high — an adrenaline rush at the first whiff of tear gas. In the bright police lights, things take on a cinematic quality.  This is why I am here — to bear witness, while coughing my face off, to thousands of Georgians ready to take a tear gas canister to the face to keep the democracy for which they’ve fought for the last 20 years.  Protesters brandishing a European Union flag brace as they are sprayed by a water canon during clashes with riot police near the Georgian parliament in Tbilisi on March 7.AFP/Getty ImagesAs an American, I often get asked why I live here, most often by cynical taxi drivers. The reason is that I’ve always believed that in Georgia, especially as a journalist, one person can make a difference.   When Parliament tried to push through a law that would mean I’d have to register as a “foreign agent,” for the first time I questioned my decision to raise my family here. My wife is Georgian, and we have two young boys. I’m not alone in thinking this. I find little comfort in the fact that the law was revoked. For the first time in 15 years, I didn’t feel welcome in Georgia.  But there is another thing too. It has taken me 15 years to realize that living in a place where one person can make a difference for the better means that one person also can make a difference for the worse.  Still, Ivanishvili is losing his footing. He is making increasingly desperate decisions that indicate a growing animosity toward the United States. By some absurd calculus, Ivanishvili appears to believe that Putin is the only man who can help his ruling Georgian Dream party hold on to power in next year’s elections. He has chosen sides.   I don’t see how a country full of designated “foreign agents” could be good for tourism or any sector. Entire farms funded by organizations like USAID and the German development agency GIZ could be labeled foreign intelligence operations while growing tomatoes, blueberries and kiwifruit. There would be black-op asparagus harvests and clandestine apple collections. Perhaps vegetables would come with both non-GMO and non-foreign-agent-funded stickers. I wonder if they would taste any different.  Ironically, the actual Russian intelligence agents in Georgia appear to be welcome. In the 10 years since Ivanishvili came to power, it seems that no actual Russian agent has been prosecuted.  People hold flags of the Europan Union, Ukraine and the US during a demonstration outside Georgia's Parliament in Tbilisi on March 8.Vano Shlamov/AFP/Getty ImagesHans Gutbrod, who studied similar laws in other countries for the Transparency and Accountability Initiative (TAI), calls it the “We can repress anyone we like law.” There are “clear tell-tale signs when a law has bad faith. This law here has all of them.” After the bill was withdrawn, Gutbrod told me, “Georgian Dream is greatly weakened. If it cannot project strength, it will struggle to command the loyalty of local elites, especially of police chiefs, that it needs to win elections.”  In response to the government’s violence, US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said, “It is our strong hope that the Georgian Government listens to the Georgian people.” As of Thursday, that happened.  In its attempt to explain why it retracted the bill, the ruling party claimed that “the radical forces were able to involve some of the youth in illegal activities.”  Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili (who is politically independent though her campaign was originally funded by the ruling party), currently visiting the United States, told CNN that the draft law “looks very much like Russian politics.”  Elsewhere, Irakli Kobakhidze, the chair of the ruling Georgian Dream, thanked the police and called Georgia’s 2003 Rose Revolution “the Revolution of Spies.” It is abundantly clear which side he is on.As a journalist living here in Tbilisi for the last 15 years, one gets used to the tear gas.Will Cathcart  Meanwhile, former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who led the Rose Revolution, is allegedly being poisoned in a Georgian prison (full disclosure, I was a media advisor to President Saakashvili from 2009-2011). Pro-Western Saakashvili also remains Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief reforms adviser, despite his arrest in Georgia in 2021. And as experts have observed, his prison illnesses are part of a familiar pattern in Putin’s Russia.   Saakashvili is not inherent or essential to Georgia’s democratic future — but his death in a Georgian prison would be a blow capable of thwarting Georgia’s democratic aspirations and its relationship with the United States in particular. It would also be a gift to Putin.  Ironically, the Georgian Dream government was able to come to power through a peaceful election because of Saakashvili’s genuine commitment to democracy.   The ruling party’s increasing hostility toward US and EU ambassadors and its refusal to support Ukraine have cost it a great deal with no apparent payoff. This week’s legislative retraction will make Ivanishvili only look weaker. Tomorrow, he may double down on even more inept legislation.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook The retraction of this bill is a much-needed win for civil society. But it also comes with a warning. The ruling party has revealed who they are. The Georgian people should use this opportunity to demand that Saakashvili is pardoned before it is too late.   Georgia — at its heart — is a democracy. Ivanishvili will learn this the hard way, as will Putin.  In the meantime, Georgians will continue staring down fire hoses and tear gas canisters. It is the same reason why Ukrainian troops will prevail. They are fighting for something, not against something. Once you give democracy to a people, it is very difficult to take it away.

Chinese troops attend the opening ceremony of the 'Peace Mission 2021' joint counter-terrorism military exercise held in Russia in September 2021.Li Chun/China News Service/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      Chinese state-owned defense firms have maintained trade relationships with sanctioned Russian defense companies during the past year, even as many of the world’s leading economies cut ties with Moscow and the companies driving its continued assault on Ukraine.     Customs records reviewed by CNN show key companies within both countries’ vast military-industrial complexes have continued their years-long relationships, despite the horror Moscow has unleashed in Europe.   putin firma ley suspension new start lkl jose levy_00015214.pngvideo    Putin says Russia's economy is strong. Biden disagrees. Here's the realityRecords show that throughout 2022, through at least mid-November, Beijing-based defense contractor Poly Technologies sent at least a dozen shipments – including helicopter parts and air-to-ground radio equipment – to a state-backed Russian firm sanctioned by the US for its connection to leader Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.   Poly Technology’s long-term trade partner – Ulan Ude Aviation Plant, a purveyor of military-grade helicopters – also continued to send parts and several helicopters to the Beijing-based company last year, trade data show.   Most of the helicopter parts included in the shipments to Russia were labeled for use in the multipurpose Mi-171E helicopter, designed for transport and search and rescue. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China began importing this model of chopper from Russia more than 10 years ago.    Three shipments from Poly Technologies were labeled as including products for the operation or service of the Russian-made Mi-171SH, a military transport helicopter that can be equipped with weapons and has been used in Moscow’s operations in Ukraine.    There is no evidence that any of the goods exchanged are directly feeding Russia’s war.  CNNvideo    National security adviser warns China about sending weapons to RussiaThe customs records came from two data sets. The first was provided by trade data firm Import Genius, whose information is collated by secondary sources from official Russian customs and shipment records.    Washington-based think tank C4ADS, which collates official customs records aggregated from multiple third-party providers, provided the second set.    CNN has not independently verified the data, which may provide a partial but not complete picture of the trade.   Military and security experts say the parts sent from the Chinese firm to Russia are fairly basic equipment for Russian-designed aircraft that could be part of existing contracts and standard business relationships between the companies.    But last year’s trade underscores enduring ties between key players in the state-backed defense sectors on both sides – relationships that had strengthened over the past decade as Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping developed their strategic alignment.    Experts say such well-established networks could be leveraged if Beijing were to provide direct, lethal aid for the Kremlin’s war effort.    Western leaders in recent weeks have warned China is considering that step. Beijing has denied this, derided the warning as a “smear,” and repeatedly defended its “normal” trade with Russia and rejected what it calls “unilateral” sanctions against Moscow.   A worker engages in helicopter production at the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant in Russia in September 2020. Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    Evolving partnership Beijing and Moscow’s military ties have evolved dramatically since the height of the Cold War – a period marked by mutual hostility and ideological divergence.    While some frictions remain, the two authoritarian neighbors have grown close, especially under Putin and Xi, who together declared a “no limits” partnership just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.   That includes a growing security relationship.   Following the fall of the Soviet Union, a robust, but decidedly one-way weapons trade flourished in which Russia marketed its superior weaponry to China.   More recently, the rapid modernization of China’s military has begun to shift that dynamic.   In 2021, Putin boasted that the two countries were “developing together certain high-tech types of weapons,” according to Russian state media, and lauded their joint military exercises – which have also expanded in scope and geographic range.

Those are being integrated into an “an increasingly sophisticated supply chain,” according to Alex Gabuev, a senior fellow at the international think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.     Then came the Ukraine war.    So far, China has stepped carefully around sweeping Western penalties targeting those supporting Russia – although 10 Chinese companies have been hit by US restrictions related to the war.    But a major question for Western officials is whether existing defense relationships could be used by China to supply lethal aid for the Kremlin’s war effort, which is widely believed to be running low on ammunition and arms.   Last month CNN reported that US intelligence officials believe the Chinese government is considering sending drones and ammunition to Russia.   On March 7, China’s new foreign minister Qin Gang said that China “has not provided weapons to either side” of Russia’s war, and denounced US concerns in the matter as hypocritical.    Observers of Chinese foreign affairs say its leaders are well aware of the reputational and economic damage if it is perceived to be backing Moscow militarily – and many are skeptical Beijing would take such a step to aid a nuclear-armed Russia at this time.   “Russia is losing this war in general terms … but it’s not a loss that would lead to Putin’s demise and democratization of Russia, so I don’t see reasons for China now to do more than they are doing,” said Gabuev.

China is also not alone in continuing procurement from a Russia at war.   When asked by CNN about the shipments from China to sanctioned Russian firms, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was “unaware of the situation,” and that China “stand(s) firmly on the side of dialogue and peace.”    The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.    But on February 27 its spokesman said Russia saw “no need to comment further” on claims that Russia asked China for military equipment which he said had already been refuted by Beijing.

China Poly Group did not respond to a request for comment.  The company’s trade partner Ulan Ude Aviation Plant, a subsidiary of top state-owned manufacturer Russian Helicopters, which makes the widely used Mi-8/17 series helicopters long integral to Russian military transport, also did not respond to a request for comment.   Two other key companies appear in the customs data – China’s AVIC International Holding, controlled by state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, and Russia’s United Engine Corporation (UEC), which is part of state-owned defense giant Rostec.   Their trade involved Russian-designed jet engine parts, many of which were labeled for an engine used in Chinese fighter jets.    Shipments from AVIC International to UEC made through July last year were listed as contractual obligations under warranty, and export records show UEC shipping parts for the same engine model to China including as recently as December, according to data from Import Genius.   AVIC International and UEC did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously referenced shipments made from Poly Technologies and AVIC International Holding to Russian partners.

But China may not be too concerned about the transactions shown in the trade data reviewed by CNN, according to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.    “This type of export has to be approved by the government. But given the nature of these parts and the fact that (Poly Technologies) has been under US sanction since 2013, the government may not see the need not to approve,” she said.

Sun said it was no surprise Russia would continue fulfilling contracts for Chinese-purchased equipment, but warned goods going the opposite direction could be “reimported by Russia to supply their war attrition.”   It’s also unlikely that the full picture will ever be revealed.   “Neither China nor Russia wants Western intelligence to be aware of the depth and breadth of their strategic alignment,” said Alexander Korolev, a senior lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales in Australia.   If China were to supply lethal aid, Korolev added, “everything would be done to cover this up.”   “And one way to cover it up is to make it look as if it’s just a part of regular, long-term military technical cooperation – rather than a response to the war.”     CNN’s Beijing bureau and Josh Pennington contributed reporting.

A Ukrainian Army soldier places a US-made Javelin missile in a fighting position on the frontline on May 20, 2022, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine.John Moore/Getty ImagesWashingtonCNN      Russia has been capturing some of the US and NATO-provided weapons and equipment left on the battlefield in Ukraine and sending them to Iran, where the US believes Tehran will try to reverse-engineer the systems, four sources familiar with the matter told CNN.   Over the last year, US, NATO and other Western officials have seen several instances of Russian forces seizing smaller, shoulder-fired weapons equipment including Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft systems that Ukrainian forces have at times been forced to leave behind on the battlefield, the sources told CNN.  In many of those cases, Russia has then flown the equipment to Iran to dismantle and analyze, likely so the Iranian military can attempt to make their own version of the weapons, sources said. Russia believes that continuing to provide captured Western weapons to Iran will incentivize Tehran to maintain its support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, the sources said.   US officials don’t believe that the issue is widespread or systematic, and the Ukrainian military has made it a habit since the beginning of the war to report to the Pentagon any losses of US-provided equipment to Russian forces, officials said. Still, US officials acknowledge that the issue is difficult to track.   It’s not clear if Iran has successfully reverse-engineered any US weapons taken in Ukraine, but Tehran has proven highly adept at developing weapons systems based on US equipment seized in the past.

(Photo by Sergei SUPINSKY / AFP) (Photo by SERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP via Getty Images)Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty ImagesExclusive: Iranian drones appear to contain modified explosives designed for maximum damage to Ukrainian infrastructure, report findsA key weapon in Iran’s inventory, the Toophan anti-tank guided missile, was reverse engineered from the American BGM-71 TOW missile in the 1970s. The Iranians also intercepted a US-made drone in 2011, a Lockheed Martin RQ-170 “Sentinel”, and reverse-engineered it to create a new drone that crossed into Israeli airspace in 2018 before being shot down.    “Iran has demonstrated the capability to reverse-engineer US weapons in the past,” said Jonathan Lord, a senior fellow and director of the Middle East security program at the Center for a New American Security. “They reverse-engineered the TOW anti-tank guided missile, creating a near-perfect replica they called the Toophan, and have since proliferated it to the Houthis and Hezbollah. Iran could do the same with a Stinger, which could threaten both civil and military aviation throughout the region. A reverse-engineered Javelin could be used by Hamas or Hezbollah to threaten an Israeli Merkava tank. In the hands of Iran’s proxies, these weapons pose a real threat to Israel’s conventional military forces.”  The coordination is yet another example of Moscow’s growing defense partnership with Tehran, which has intensified over the last year as Russia has become increasingly desperate for external military support for its war against Ukraine. The partnership is not only further destabilizing Ukraine, but it could also threaten Iran’s neighbors in the Middle East, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said last month.  CNN has reached out to the Russian embassy in Washington and the Iranian UN mission for comment.US has been warning about threats posed by IranSenior US military officials, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, were both in the Middle East this month for discussions with their counterparts there that centered around the threats posed by Iran, the Pentagon said.  “Over the past year, Russia’s military cooperation with Iran has deepened. and that poses serious challenges for this region and for the safety of your citizens,” Austin said at a press conference alongside Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv on Thursday.   “Iran is gaining important battlefield expertise and experience in Ukraine that will eventually transfer to its dangerous proxies in the Middle East,” Austin said. “In return for Iranian support in Ukraine, Russia has been offering Iran unprecedented defense cooperation, including on missiles and air defense.”  Huge, unanticipated losses of equipment and harsh Western sanctions have made it difficult for Russia to continue producing the weapons and ammunition it needs to maintain its offensive in Ukraine. As a result, Russia has asked for and received hundreds of drones from Iran, as well as artillery and tank rounds, that Russian forces have used to devastating effect against Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.

(AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky)Dmitri Lovetsky/APIntelligence suggests China is considering sending drones and ammunition to Russia, sources familiar sayIn exchange, Iran has sought billions of dollars worth of military equipment from Russia, according to the White House, including fighter jets, radar systems and helicopters.   The Pentagon late last year expanded its efforts to track US weapons provided to Ukraine, including through on-site inspections conducted by US military personnel stationed at the US embassy in Kyiv.   Undersecretary of defense for policy Colin Kahl told lawmakers earlier this year that the US has seen instances of the Russians capturing some US-provided systems on the battlefield, but not in large numbers.  “What we’re not seeing is any evidence of significant diversion,” Kahl said. “Our assessment is, if some of these systems have been diverted, it’s by Russians who have captured things on the battlefield, which always happens, but that there’s no evidence the Ukrainians are diverting it to the black market.”  Asked about this reporting, a defense official referred CNN to Kahl’s comments.  The State Department also said in an October fact sheet that “pro-Russian forces’ capture of Ukrainian weapons, including donated materiel, has been the main vector of diversion so far and could result in onward transfers.”   The department also specifically cited man-portable air defense systems – a category that includes Stingers – and anti-tank missiles as “particularly sensitive and advanced conventional weapons” that, if diverted, could hinder regional security.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping takes his oath while securing a historic third term as president, during a ceremonial vote in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Friday.Mark R. Cristino/ReutersHong KongCNN      Xi Jinping’s unprecedented third term as China’s president was officially endorsed by the country’s political elite on Friday, solidifying his control and making him the longest-serving head of state of Communist China since its founding in 1949.  Xi was reappointed Friday as president for another five years by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in a ceremonial vote in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People – a highly choreographed exercise in political theater meant to demonstrate the legitimacy and unity of the ruling elite.  He received a unanimous 2,952 votes followed by a standing ovation.   The reappointment of Xi, China’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, was largely seen as a formality, after the 69-year-old secured a norm-shattering third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party last fall.  In China, the presidency – or “state chairman” in Chinese – is a largely ceremonial title. Real power resides in the positions of head of the party and military, two key roles that Xi also holds and was reappointed to at a key Communist Party congress in October.  Nevertheless, his reappointment as head of state officially completes his transition into a second decade in power.   And it comes amid a broader reshuffle of leadership roles in the central government, or the State Council, and other state organizations that further increases Xi’s already firm grasp on the levers of power.  Li Qiang, one of Xi’s most trusted protégés, is expected to be chosen China’s premier on Saturday.   Traditionally, the premiership is an influential role in charge of the economy, although over the past decade, its power has been severely eroded by Xi, who has taken almost all decision-making into his own hands.   On Friday, the National People’s Congress (NPC) also appointed other key state leaders, including Zhao Leji as the body’s head and Han Zheng as the country’s vice-president.  The newly appointed leaders all took a public oath of allegiance to the Chinese constitution inside the Great Hall of the People.  The NPC also approved a sweeping plan to reform institutions under the State Council, including the formation of a financial regulatory body and national data bureau and a revamp of its science and technology ministry.  The overhaul is seen as a further step by Xi to strengthen Communist Party control over key areas of policymaking.Challenges aheadWhile Xi has secured a firm grip on power, he faces a myriad of challenges both at home and abroad.  The Chinese economy is struggling to recover from three years of harsh zero-Covid restrictions, investor confidence is waning, and a demographic crisis is looming as the country registered its first population decline in six decades.  China is also facing a series of diplomatic headwinds from Washington and other Western capitals, as relations plummeted in recent years over Beijing’s human rights record, military build-up, handling of Covid and growing partnership with Russia.  In unusually direct remarks Monday, Xi accused the US of leading a campaign to suppress China and causing its serious domestic woes.  “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,” Xi told a group of government advisers representing private businesses on the sidelines of the NPC meeting.  On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Xi on his extended term, according to Russian state media.   “I am confident that working together, we will ensure the further growth of fruitful Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields,” Putin said.  Putin also noted that Russia highly appreciated Xi’s personal contribution “to strengthening relations of comprehensive cooperation and strategic interaction” between Moscow and Beijing, TASS said.Xi has now entered new historical territory. No Chinese leader had held the title of head of state for more than 10 years, including Communist China’s founding father, Chairman Mao Zedong.   Liu Shaoqi, who took over as state chairman from Mao in 1959, was sacked in 1968 and persecuted to death a year later during Mao’s tumultuous Cultural Revolution.  After Mao’s death, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping introduced presidential term limits in China’s constitution in 1982 to avoid the kind of chaos and catastrophe seen under Mao’s life-long rule.   Deng also led institutional reforms to bring a greater separation of positions and functions between the party and the state.  However, those efforts have been severely undermined by Xi, who greatly expanded the party’s hold on power – and his own grip over the party.  In 2018, China’s legislature abolished presidential term limits in a ceremonial vote, effectively allowing Xi to rule for life.    CNN’s Sandi Sidhu contributed to this report.

Haley’s proposal comes as the budget wars are heating up, and the more Republicans touch the third rail of entitlement programs, the more Democrats will benefit.   President Joe Biden, showing the power of the bully pulpit to shape the national agenda, has put forth a bold budget proposal that seeks to cut the deficit by increasing taxes on higher income Americans while protecting Medicare and discretionary spending, reducing prescription drug costs for seniors and capping insulin at $35 a month for all Americans.  Following several months of Republicans doubling down on culture war issues that they hope will peel away the support of disaffected Democrats and independents while energizing the Republican base, Biden is hitting back hard on real issues that affect millions of Americans’ daily lives.    Rather than spending time on issues like policing classroom textbooks or stoking fears over transgender Americans, Biden wants to put money where his mouth is. The president is offering a fiscal blueprint steeped in the traditions of his party by ensuring the commitment of the federal government to provide a social safety net — and funding those programs in the most progressive way possible.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano)Fernando Llano/APOpinion: The tide may be turning in the fight between democracy and autocracySeeking to put Republicans calling for cutbacks in support to Ukraine in a difficult position, he is also asking for increases in military spending so that the United States can continue to support Ukraine in its war against Russia.    As for Haley’s proposal, it is not surprising that Republicans like former President Donald Trump have already attacked fellow GOP candidates for wanting to raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, while others in the party are scrambling to distance themselves from a House Republican Caucus that is pushing for draconian cuts to domestic programs. While the party has backed away from touching Social Security and Medicare, for now, they are instead pushing for massive reductions in other programs such as food assistance and housing programs for lower-income Americans.   With the decision to raise the debt ceiling still unsettled, the House GOP is threatening to send the nation into a financial spiral if the administration does not concede to its demands. It’s not a great look for Republicans, and there is good reason that many Americans don’t trust the GOP’s promises to back off Social Security and Medicare. First of all, House Republicans have shown they are capable of resorting to extreme measures. Secondly, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence, two potential 2024 presidential candidates, have previously endorsed privatizing the programs or making cuts, as have other prominent members of the party.   The problem for Republicans is that these and other domestic programs remain extremely popular. Even Haley’s proposal to increase the retirement age and means test benefits won’t sit well with millions of Americans who count on and support these two universal social insurance programs that have done so much to alleviate the challenges of old age. Other domestic policies also command strong support as polls show that voters want the government to play a major role on a number of issues — including ensuring access to health care and helping people get out of poverty — even when they don’t trust in the government to always do the right thing.

Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesOpinion: Republicans are playing with fireSome Republicans learned these hard lessons with the Affordable Care Act, which has become increasingly popular despite strong opposition from Republicans, who spent years trying to repeal the legislation. That effort culminated in the famous moment in 2017 when Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona gave a dramatic thumbs down on the Senate floor, blowing up Trump’s “skinny repeal” bill. Not surprisingly, Trump is now insisting that the GOP should vow that they won’t touch Social Security and Medicare benefits.   Biden’s plan to raise taxes from 37% to 39.6% on Americans who earn more than $400,000 a year and impose a minimum tax on billionaires is also a winning strategy, since Americans tend to support progressive taxation. The move makes predictable criticisms against the president as a “tax-and-spend” liberal more difficult.   Although the shadow of President Ronald Reagan’s famous line that “government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem,” continues to shape the anti-government rhetoric of the GOP, the reality was that his administration failed to make the draconian cuts to domestic spending that he promised. (While he succeeded in reducing spending in some areas, he failed to dismantle any major domestic programs.)    Indeed, his administration quickly backed off from a plan to curtail Social Security benefits in 1981, after Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill pounced on the White House, saying, “For the first time since 1935 people would suffer because they trusted in the Social Security system. I’m not talking about politics. I’m talking about decency. It is a rotten thing to do. It is a despicable thing.” It was from this battle that the concept of Social Security being a “third rail” in American politics emerged.

Biden understands this, as he demonstrated during his State of the Union address, when he backed Republicans into a corner on Social Security and Medicare. It is for this reason that he is forcing Republicans to have a conversation, with specifics, about what they mean when they attack the government and federal spending.   For it is one thing to tell Americans that Washington is broken and another to say they will slash the federal benefits upon which so many of them have come to depend on.

A total of 81 missiles were used in a “massive attack” on Ukrainian infrastructure, including six Kinzhal ballistic missiles that have the ability to elude Kyiv’s air defenses, the Ukrainian military said.  “The attack is really large-scale and for the first time using such different types of missiles. We see that this time as many as six Kinzhal were used. This is an attack like I don’t remember seeing before,” Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Air Force Command of Ukraine, said on Ukrainian television Thursday.   “So far, we have no capabilities to counter these weapons,” he added, referring to the Kinzhals, plus six X-22 air-launched cruise missiles that were also launched by Russian forces.  “It’s been a difficult night,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday in a Facebook message.   “The enemy fired 81 missiles in an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians again, returning to their miserable tactics. The occupiers can only terrorize civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelensky said.   He listed 10 regions across Ukraine where aerial attacks took place, including Dnipro, Odesa, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, and said the attacks hit “critical infrastructure and residential buildings.”  Three Russian rockets launched against Ukraine from Russia's Belgorod region are seen at dawn in Kharkiv, Ukraine, March 9. Vadim Belikov/AP“Unfortunately, there are injured and dead. My condolences to the families,” he added.  Russia used the nuclear-capable Kinzhal missile, which it has described as a hypersonic weapon, on a few occasions in the first weeks of its invasion last year. But the powerful weapon, which Ukraine doesn’t have the capability to shoot down, has rarely been seen over the country’s skies.  At least 11 people were killed and more than 20 injured during the overnight attacks, according to preliminary information from regional authorities.  In Kyiv, an air raid alert lasted for almost 7 hours overnight into Thursday and power outages were implemented as a preventative measure, regional authorities said. In the Zolochiv community near Lviv, a fire broke out when the fragments of a Russian missile were shot down, regional authorities said.   The fire destroyed three residential buildings, and three cars. The rubble was being cleared and rescuers were searching for additional victims on Thursday morning. Several infrastructure facilities and other buildings were hit elsewhere in Ukraine.

Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said the agency was carrying out operations following “armed Ukrainian nationalists who violated the state border.” Russian President Vladimir Putin described the incident as a “terrorist attack.” A local official said two civilians were killed.  CNN cannot independently verify the Russian claims, and local media did not carry any images of the supposed incidents, any type of confrontation or an alleged raid reported by Russian authorities.  Russia’s pretext for Thursday’s attacks was dismissed by Kyiv’s Defense Ministry, which likened the Kremlin’s claims of “retaliation” to propaganda tactics used by the Nazi regime in justifying the use of V-1 flying bombs over London during World War II. “Brothers in spirit,” the ministry said, referring to the Kremlin and the Third Reich.Rare use of Kinzhal missileThe use of such a wide and unpredictable array of weaponry seemingly marks a shift in the Kremlin’s strategy.  The Kinzhal, an air-launched variant of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) which has also, more frequently, been used in Ukraine, was unveiled by Putin in 2018 as a cornerstone of a modernized Russian arsenal.   Like virtually all ballistic missiles it is hypersonic, which means they travel at least five times the speed of sound, but it is also particularly difficult to detect because it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions.   “Russia likely developed the unique missile to more easily target critical European infrastructure … (its) speed, in combination with the missile’s erratic flight trajectory and high maneuverability, could complicate interception,” according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).  Russia’s use of the missile on Ukrainian targets last March was its first known use in combat, according to CSIS, and it was subsequently used again in May.    Rescuers carry a body from residential buildings destroyed by a Russian missile strike on March 9.State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Lviv region via ReutersEight Iranian-made Shahed drones were also used in Thursday’s attacks, authorities said. A senior US defense official said Thursday that Ukraine is becoming a “battle lab” for testing Iranian weapons outside of the Middle East. The official spoke ahead of US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s visit to Israel where Iranian-Russian military cooperation will be on the agenda.  “Everyone should be preparing for what the threat scenarios look like when Iran takes the tactics, techniques and procedures it learned in Ukraine and starts to use those coercive tactics here,” the official said in reference to the Middle East.    The barrage came as most focus in Ukraine was fixed to Bakhmut, the eastern city that Russia’s ground forces have been assaulting for weeks and appear to be on the cusp of capturing.  CNNExclusive: Zelensky warns of 'open road' through Ukraine's east if Russia captures Bakhmut, as he resists calls to retreatUkraine’s troops have sustained a determined defense of the city even as some military experts advocate for a tactical withdrawal.   Zelensky said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday that Kyiv’s ongoing resistance in the city is “tactical,” warning that Russians could advance towards other key cities to the west if they capture Bakhmut.  “We understand that after Bakhmut they could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk, they could go to Sloviansk, it would be open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine, in the Donetsk direction,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an exclusive interview from Kyiv. “That’s why our guys are standing there.”    Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the known death toll in Ukraine on Thursday from overnight attacks was 11, not 16. This story was also updated to clarify that virtually all ballistic missiles -- not missiles in general -- are hypersonic.   CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova and Radina Gigova contributed reporting.

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.CNN      For nearly two decades, democracies around the world have been losing ground. Countless autocrats have managed to pulverize the foundations of democracy in their countries by passing arcane laws that quietly erode civil liberties, press freedoms or the separation of powers, to name a few examples.    Frida GhitisA new report from the non-partisan Freedom House confirms that millions of people in dozens of countries saw their freedoms eroded last year. There were more countries that lost freedom in 2022 than those that gained it. But look closer and there are promising signs of change. The pace of decline is slowing and it’s possible that the pushback we’re seeing from protesters in places like Mexico, Israel and Georgia will reverse the trend.  Freedom House uses the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to measure individual freedom in every country, giving it a numeric score and a classification of Free, Partly Free or Not Free based on factors including press freedoms, rule of law, freedom of association and belief, free and fair elections and others.   By this measure, freedom has been declining worldwide for 17 years. Autocracy is still on the march, and democracy is still on the defensive. Nowhere is that more crassly on display than in Ukraine, a fledgling democracy defending against an unprovoked attack by its autocratic neighbor, Russia.   In most places, however, autocrats are advancing their agenda more subtly by changing the rules of the game and amassing more power for themselves. Freedom House found democracy losing ground in Tunisia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Hungary, Burkina Faso and dozens of other countries.   But there was some glimmer of good news: last year, there were 35 countries that became less free than they were the previous year — the smallest number since the most recent trend of democratic decline started in 2005. Meanwhile, nearly the same number of countries (34) saw improvements, suggesting change may be afoot.  Selfie of Odessa Rae and Alexey Navalny in front of the suspect board. Odessa RaeOpinion: Putin's nemesis has a spirit that can outlast any strongmanFreedom House noted “While authoritarians remain extremely dangerous, they are not unbeatable. … Meanwhile, democratic alliances demonstrated solidarity and vigor.”  Some of the increase in freedom can be attributed to the rollback of pandemic restrictions, but that’s not the full story. Pro-democracy supporters have been making their voices heard and winning key battles.  Russia’s assault on Ukraine has also put the choice between autocracy and democracy in stark relief, prompting much of the world to side with Ukraine.  And yet, not every country accepts the premise that Ukraine’s struggle is a contest over freedom and democracy. Many governments in the so-called Global South have rejected that framing. To be sure, the governments — if not the people — of India, South Africa and other southern hemisphere nations have been reluctant to support Ukraine.  Russian propaganda has long exploited simmering resentments against the West’s imperialistic past and recent foreign policy interventions, now promoting the view that Ukraine is a puppet of the West. The narrative is particularly powerful in Latin America, where Kremlin-controlled media outlets such as RT have big audiences.  But when Russian tanks plowed into Ukraine, many other countries saw a blatant and unprovoked trampling of Ukraine’s sovereignty in an ongoing battle of freedom versus oppression. To Russia’s neighbors in particular, the Kremlin now embodies the risks to their own freedom.  That’s why in Tbilisi, capital of the Republic of Georgia, protesters took to the streets this week to decry a draft law they dubbed the “Russian law,” that would have forced organizations that receive a fraction of their funding from abroad to register as “foreign agents.” The draft bill would have subjected them to increased government monitoring and made it more difficult for Georgia to ever join the European Union. A similar law in Russia was key to dismantling civil society.Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesOpinion: The toxic brew poisoning American societyBut on Thursday, following two nights of protests in the capital, Georgia’s ruling party announced it would be withdrawing the controversial bill. It was a win for civil society—but also a warning of what this government is capable of.   Elsewhere, defenders of democracy are also paying close attention to efforts to rewrite the rules by leaders with authoritarian tendencies. While similar legislative proposals might have previously slipped under the radar, citizens in many countries seem more aware of what’s at stake, given the erosion of democracy around the world.   For nine consecutive weeks, Israelis have staged some of the largest protests in the country’s history. They are trying to stop the current government coalition’s plans to overhaul the legal system in a way that would undercut the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law and the separation of powers. Among other controversial changes, a bill would allow a simple majority of the Knesset, or the Israeli parliament, to overturn Supreme Court rulings.   The blowback against the law has been unlike anything the country has seen. Even elite military reservists from the vaunted Israeli air force, special forces and military intelligence have said they would refuse to serve if the plan to weaken the Supreme Court goes into effect. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak called it “the worst crisis” since the founding of the modern State of Israel.  In Mexico, the capital’s central square, the Zócalo was filled with demonstrators in late February, in a show of force against a law that would undercut the country’s independent electoral authority. Organizers estimated an incredible 500,000 people turned out.  The law, which has already passed but is being challenged in court, would slash the budget of the National Electoral Institute, INE, and change the way key members are selected. Critics said it amounts to dynamiting the foundations of Mexico’s democratic institutions.

As the Freedom House report helpfully reminds us, some countries that used to be deeply repressive are now growing into strong democracies, and democracies that have faced grave challenges have ultimately proved resilient. That commitment by so many people to continue fighting for freedom is what ensures that no autocracy lasts forever.  This article has been updated to clarify the Freedom House report’s findings that 35 countries became less free than they were the previous year.

Georgian lawmakers voted against the bill in its second reading by a margin of 35 to one, according to Georgia’s public broadcaster First Channel.  Friday’s vote came a day after the country’s ruling party announced it would scrap the proposed legislation, hours after tens of thousands of people rallied outside the Georgian parliament for a second night of protests. Senior officials in the US and the European Union also expressed concern over the bill.   The controversial legislation would have required organizations receiving 20% or more of their annual income from abroad to register as “foreign agents” or face heavy fines – a proposal that rights experts warned would have a chilling effect on civil society in the country and damage its democracy.

Western leaders welcomed Thursday’s decision to shelve the bill, with the European Union’s office in Georgia saying it encouraged lawmakers in the country “to resume pro-EU reforms.” Though Georgia was not granted EU candidacy status after applying for membership in March 2022, the European Council has expressed readiness to grant that status if the country implements certain reforms.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Georgia’s decision to withdraw the bill is “fraught with provocations” and denied Russian influence in proposing the Putin-style “foreign agents” bill.   “The situation that served as a trigger for these popular unrest and insurgent manifestations has nothing to do with the Russian Federation,” said Peskov, adding that “Russia has nothing to do with it either in essence or in form. We do not interfere in internal Georgian affairs.”  Peskov instead alleged US interference in Georgian affairs, and claimed Washington was “diligently trying to again add an anti-Russian element to it.” Fight ‘not over’Protesters outside the Georgian parliament welcomed the withdrawal of the bill, but said they will continue to fight for their country to join the EU in the form of a 12-point plan.   “This is a victory for our people … we were dispersed many times, but we returned with a common European and national idea. The main demand of this protest was to fail this bill, but our aspiration is that Georgia should become a member of the European Union,” said Tamar Jakeli, one of the protest organizers, according to First Channel.

Gogia had said that the proposed legislation was a clear threat to human rights in Georgia.    CNN’s Rhea Mogul, Sophie Tanno, Niamh Kennedy, Hannah Ritchie and Sana Noor Haq contributed reporting.

However, the announcement was met with caution among protesters who say they will continue to demonstrate until the government formally denounces the bill and releases all those who have been detained.   The proposed legislation was compared to a draconian set of laws adopted in Russia and condemned by rights groups as a bid to curtail basic freedoms and crack down on dissent in the country.  The developments sparked mass unrest, with thousands of demonstrators gathering outside Tbilisi’s parliament building, waving not just the Georgian flag but also that of the European Union.  Meanwhile, Moscow said it has been watching the two-day riots with concern. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday urged Russian nationals staying in the neighboring country to be cautious.   “This is our neighbouring state and despite the fact that we do not have relations with Georgia as such, the situation there cannot but cause our concern,” Peskov said. He went on to advise Russian citizens to “refrain from staying in areas where these street riots are taking place” and to be “extremely cautious.”  Georgia, which won its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, has long been playing a balancing act between its citizens’ pro-European sentiment and the geopolitical aims of its powerful neighbor, Russia.  In March 2022, Georgia applied for EU membership – an ambition that may be jeopardized by the proposed legislation.     Here’s a look at what the controversial law would have meant for Georgia, and how it reached this point.What was in the bills?According to Giorgi Gogia, associate director of the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch, two bills were being discussed in Georgia’s parliament.  The first bill would have required organizations including non-governmental groups and print, online and broadcast media to register as “foreign agents” if they receive 20% or more of their annual income from abroad.  Those who do not comply would have faced fines of $9,600 US dollars (25,000 Georgian Lari).  The second bill expanded the scope of “agents of foreign influence” to include individuals and increased the penalties for failure to comply from fines to up to five years in prison.  For Gogia, the bills represented a clear threat to human rights in Georgia. “They threaten to marginalize and discredit critical voices in the country. This threat is real,” he told CNN on Tuesday ahead of its scrapping on Wednesday.  Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili speaks to a member of her team in her office in Tbilisi, Georgia, on March 8, 2022.Daro Sulakauri/Getty Images“Under the disguise of transparency, the latest statements by the Georgian authorities strongly suggest that if adopted, the law will be weaponized to further stigmatize and penalize independent groups, media and critical voices in the country.”  The first draft law passed on Tuesday in a session that was broadcast live on the legislature’s website, with 76 votes for and 13 against. The bill would have needed to pass further readings to become law.  The President of Georgia, Salome Zourabichvili, pledged to veto it, and as she threw her support behind protesters in a video message posted on Facebook.  “Those who support this law today, all those who voted for this law today are violating the Constitution. All of them are alienating us from Europe,” Zourabichvili said in the clip on Tuesday.  “I said on day one that I would veto this law, and I will do that.”  However, the country’s ruling Georgian Dream party – of which Zourabichvili is not a member – would have had the parliamentary majority to overcome a presidential veto, according to Human Rights Watch.Which countries have imposed similar laws?Georgia’s bill followed the model of a controversial law in neighboring Russia that has already imposed draconian restrictions and requirements on organizations and individuals with foreign ties, critics say.  The law was initially passed in 2012 amid a wave of public protests over allegations of election-rigging and Vladimir Putin’s intentions to return to the Russian presidency. It required organizations engaging in political activity and receiving funding from abroad to register as foreign agents and adhere to draconian rules and restrictions.  Russia’s law on Foreign Agents has been gradually updated since then, forming the backbone of an even tighter stranglehold on civil society in Russia over the past decade.  A woman affected by tear gas receives medical aid during a rally against the ""foreign agents"" law in Tbilisi, Georgia, March 7.Zurab Javakhadze/ReutersProtests erupt as Georgian parliament passes draft foreign agents billGogia said the legislation is similar to the law in Russia in that it is “trying to create a special status and legal regime for organizations and media that receive foreign funding and – under the disguise of transparency – interferes with freedom of associations and media and with their legitimate functions.”  Asked during a press briefing Thursday if the Russian law had inspired the Georgian bill, Peskov said the Kremlin has “nothing to do with this” and pointed to legislation against so-called foreign agents in the US.  Russia-aligned Belarus has had a citizenship law in place since 2002 that has a similar impact. In December 2022, the Belarusian parliament passed amendments to the law which would enable the government to target members of the political opposition, activists and other critics in exile, according to Human Rights Watch.  The draft law would allow the president to strip Belarusians abroad of their citizenship, even if they have no other.Who is the driving force behind the legislation?The bills were nominally proposed by a faction in the parliament formed by members who left the ruling Georgian Dream party, but remained in the parliamentary majority, according to Gogia.  “However, the ruling Georgian Dream party fully and publicly supported the bills and campaigned for their adoption, and almost unanimously voted for it in the first reading yesterday,” Gogia said.  The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), a think tank, believes the party is leading Georgia towards Russia’s sphere of influence.  Participants protest against the draft law outside parliament building in Tbilisi on March 8.Irakli Gedenidze/Reuters“In the last few years, and especially over the past 18 months, Georgia’s ruling coalition has made a series of moves that seem designed to distance the country from the West and shift it gradually into Russia’s sphere of influence,” a report released by the ECFR in December said.  It pointed to Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire, as a driving force behind this pivot towards Moscow.  “Much of the responsibility for this drift away from the EU lies with oligarch and former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose Georgian Dream Party dominates the governing coalition,” the report said.  Ivanishvili made a fortune while living in Russia during its turbulent transition to a market economy, and was part of an influential group of Russian bankers who supported the re-election of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1996, according to the ECFR.What comparisons have been drawn to Ukraine in 2014?Analysts have noted similarities between the situation in Georgia and Ukraine – both former Soviet republics which have found themselves caught between the East and the West.  The think tank ECFR drew comparisons between the situation in Georgia and Russia’s invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and 2022.  Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in 2011 that had Russia not invaded Georgia in 2008, NATO would have expanded into Georgia.  The 2008 conflict centered on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway provinces in Georgia. They are officially part of Georgia but have separate governments unrecognized by most countries.   Both Abkhazia and South Ossetia are propped up by Russia.  The 2008 invasion of Georgia only lasted days, but it appeared to have the same revanchist ambitions that drove Putin’s invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and last year, writes the ECFR.  “In this light, Russia’s wars in Georgia and Ukraine seem part of a single imperial project,” the report said.How would the legislation impact Georgia?The Georgia bill was widely criticized as posing a potentially chilling effect for Georgian civil society, and particularly NGOs and news organizations with links to Europe.  It would also hamper Georgia’s bid to join the European Union. An EU statement Tuesday warned that the law would be “incompatible with EU values and standards” and could have “serious repercussions on our relations.”  In February, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price also said that “anyone voting for this draft legislation” could also imperil Georgia’s relationship with Europe and the West.  “Georgia’s international and bilateral partners have been very clear that adopting a ‘foreign agent’ bill would be inconsistent with Georgia’s stated commitments to human rights and its Euro-Atlantic aspirations,” Gogia told CNN.  “I hope the Georgian authorities would heed to the warning and instead of passing the bills that would clearly impede the work of independent groups and media, they should ensure safe and enabling environment for civil society in the country.”    CNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Anna Chernova contributed to this report.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesCNN      The US and its allies have blocked or seized more than $58 billion worth of assets owned or controlled by sanctioned Russians in the past year as Western governments continue to dial up the pressure over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint statement from a multinational sanctions enforcement task force.   The Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force held its sixth multilateral deputies meeting Thursday morning to discuss the group’s continued work and pledge to “redouble” their efforts to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates. The task force is a joint effort between the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, the UK and the European Commission.   “REPO will redouble efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unjust war, countering Russian efforts to undermine, circumvent, or evade REPO’s collective sanctions,” according to a joint statement released following the meeting and obtained first by CNN.   “As Russia’s war of aggression continues, REPO members remain determined in their commitment to impose steep costs on Russia.  REPO will continue to identify, locate, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russians, with the aim of depriving the Kremlin of the funds it needs to fight its illegal war,” it continues.   The task force, which was formed last March, is also taking further steps to crack down on sanctions evasion as the US and its allies work to seal the cracks in a sanctions regime that has weakened but not crippled the Russian economy.   Following Thursday’s meeting, REPO also issued a joint global advisory to help the private sector spot and prevent common sanctions evasion methods, like using family members to maintain access to sanctioned assets, creating complex ownership structures and using third party jurisdictions and false trade information to ship controlled goods, including those that support the Kremlin’s war machine.   “This advisory will contribute to effective sanctions implementation across REPO Task Force members’ jurisdictions by preventing the undermining of financial sanctions, export controls, and other restrictive measures designed and implemented in response to Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine,” the note says.   The US was represented Thursday by Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Marshall Miller, the principal associate deputy attorney general, according to a US Treasury Department official.  The task force has blocked financial assets and seized luxury yachts, high-end real estate and even priceless art, with US officials recovering a possible Fabergé egg from one Russian oligarch’s seized yacht last summer.  But while the task force has generated splashy headlines over the past year by seizing the yachts and homes of Russia’s ultra-rich, a US Treasury official told CNN that REPO provides the governments involved a valuable and streamlined mechanism to apply many of the same tools and best practices for the broader effort to crackdown on sanctions evasion.Over one year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden administration officials are focusing on how to plug the gaps on sanctions evasion, a problem that runs the gamut of adversaries like China and allies like Turkey, India and the United Arab Emirates.   “We will engage companies, banks, regulators, and service providers in a series of jurisdictions we assess are wittingly or unwittingly providing assistance to Russia. This is a broad campaign on which we are working closely with allies and partners,” Elizabeth Rosenberg, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, said last week at the Association of Women in International Trade.   The latest crackdown started in earnest in February on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when the Biden administration announced sanctions for “over 200 individuals and entities, including both Russian and third-country actors across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East that are supporting Russia’s war effort.” Those sanctions were imposed in partnership with the G7 and other allies.  Also on Thursday, the US issued a slew of sanctions against companies involved in a “shadow banking” network established to evade sanctions, as well as entities that are part of a separate China-based network to supply critical parts for Iran’s unmanned aerial vehicle program, which it exports to Russia for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  The US Treasury issued two sets of sanctions as part of its continued efforts to crack down on sanctions evasion networks and undermine efforts to support the Kremlin’s war machine and fund the Iranian regime as both countries forge closer ties.   The first set of sanctions targets 39 companies that make up a “significant ‘shadow banking’” system that helps sanctioned Iranian oil and gas companies access the international financial system and move billions of dollars, according to the Treasury.  The second set of sanctions issued today designate a network of five China-based companies and one employee who support Iran’s UAV procurement network and are responsible for the sale and shipment of “thousands of aerospace components,” according to the Treasury.

They were discussing Russia’s siege of the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant in the strategic city of Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine.    To Ukrainians, Azovstal had become a bleak but potent symbol of resistance, sheltering about 2,600 soldiers and civilians while the fortress-like facility was pummeled by Russian bombardment for weeks. To Moscow, the vast site was a frustration, the last stubborn holdout in a city that its forces had otherwise taken control over weeks earlier.    “Block off the industrial site, so that not even a fly can escape,” Putin spat, his command broadcast on state-run television.   But as the Russian president ordered a tightening of the noose around the hulking factory complex, a small group was about to begin secret negotiations to end the siege. They involved two of Putin’s most senior generals and a Ukrainian lawmaker who once served as a Soviet paratrooper. CNN can now exclusively reveal the inner details of how the deal was struck, and who was involved in the sensitive talks.     Oleksandr Kovalov, a member of Ukrainian parliament from the Donetsk region and a veteran of the Soviet-Afghan war, told CNN he brokered the early stages of the negotiations. Two high-ranking generals from Russia’s military intelligence agency, widely known as the GRU, represented the other side: Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alexseyev, second in command of the GRU, and Maj. Gen. Alexander Zorin, both born in Ukraine.     Alexseyev has been linked to a string of brazen international incidents in recent years. He was among four GRU officers sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2016 for wide-ranging malicious cyber activity directed at undermining America’s democratic processes, including election interference. The United Kingdom and European Union sanctioned him in 2019 for the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in England with a deadly nerve agent.   Zorin, meanwhile, served as Putin’s envoy to Syria, playing an active role in talks between President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and the country’s opposition and rebel factions.    Their involvement shines a spotlight on the importance that Putin placed on resolving the Azovstal impasse and seizing Mariupol, securing his long-sought land bridge between Crimea and Russia – one of the biggest prizes of the Russian invasion.   It also illustrates a much-reported but hard-to-prove narrative right at the top of Moscow’s command of the Ukraine war – that the Russian president took control over the brutal conflict from the country’s main domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB, and placed it in the hands of the military spies, the GRU.     “Since last summer military intelligence generals assumed a more prominent role as it dawned on Putin it was not a ‘special operation’ anymore but a conventional war,” Andrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist and intelligence expert now in exile in London, told CNN. “Unfortunately, it means Putin’s readying the country for a long conventional war.”   For years, Ukraine had been part of the FSB portfolio; handing control of the war to the GRU marked a seismic shift in how Putin viewed the service.   In an essay from the Center for European Policy Analysis, Soldatov and his colleague Irina Borogan wrote that Putin was not impressed that the FSB’s highly secretive plans for the invasion were obtained by Western intelligence. The Russian president was apparently also unhappy about “the complete absence of popular uprisings by Russian-speakers” that had been promised to him.  The sprawling Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, captured in a photograph taken in 2020.Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesUnderground refuge After invading Ukraine on February 24, Russian forces swept to the city of Mariupol in days but then spent months trying to fully capture it. Azovstal quickly became the epicenter of the fight.   A monstrous warren of tunnels, pipes and chimney stacks perched on the Azov Sea, the plant sprawls over four square miles and once employed more than 10,000 people. It now lies in ruins.   Russian forces shelled the facility day and night for weeks. The Ukrainians’ last stand became increasingly desperate as food and water supplies dwindled, and hundreds of casualties were left without adequate medical care. Huddled together underground in grim conditions, many soldiers and civilians began to doubt that they’d ever escape the plant alive.    It was at that point that Kovalov came in.    Kovalov’s office in Kyiv is in a non-descript administrative building, minutes from the Ukrainian Rada, or parliament. A large flag of his philanthropic organization for veterans hangs on the wall, its slogan taken from the Soviet Airborne Forces: “Nobody but us.” Against the wall, a stuffed wolf named “Droog” (“friend” in Ukrainian) stands with a frozen snarl.   The lawmaker represents a constituency of Donetsk region, in the country’s east, where he campaigned to repeal a state law enshrining Ukrainian as the official language – an important issue for many Russian-speaking people in the area.    Kovalov’s allegiances have come under scrutiny in the past. In 2014, he was accused of helping with the flight of members of a now defunct special police force division, known as the Berkut, after they carried out a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Euromaidan. He has denied supporting Berkut and told CNN that he assisted in their escape in order to prevent further bloodshed in Kyiv.    That goal has been central to his work since the war began.    As Russia’s assault on Mariupol and Azovstal dragged on, Kovalov said he remembered thinking that someone had to try to stop the madness. “Not all people want war. Many understand that this is bad and everyone at their level is trying to find a loophole for a small reconciliation.”     Kovalov said he leveraged an FSB contact in Moscow – Valentin Kryzhanovsky – in the hopes of breaking the brutal siege. Kryzhanovsky, a former Ukrainian Intelligence Services (SBU) agent who defected to Russia in 2014 and joined the FSB, is widely viewed as a traitor in Ukraine.    The two men talked about the civilians stranded in Azovstal. “There are women, children, let’s think of something,” Kovalov recalled saying.    According to the parliamentarian, many others had tried without much luck to negotiate access to the Azovstal steelworks. “There were 11 unsuccessful missions before me, and no one believed it was possible to get there at all,” he said. CNN could not independently confirm his claim.   He said that he made his plans clear to the office of Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency. Even though Budanov was doubtful of his chances, Kovalov said he gave him his blessing. Negotiations ramp up in Mariupol  On April 25, Kovalov made his first trip into Russian-occupied southern Ukraine since the war began, armed with secret passwords and encrypted communication devices from Budanov, he said, to ease passage through checkpoints into Russian-held Ukrainian territory and liaise with the Azov commanders.    He was shocked by the devastation that he witnessed on this brief, escorted tour around the city – his first of three – and documented the scene in videos and photos, which were shared with CNN. CNN examined their metadata, or file information, which lined up with the time and date of Kovalov’s journeys. One clip filmed from a car, which shows blackened high-rise buildings and shattered storefronts, was geolocated to Metalurhiv Avenue in Mariupol using available street imagery.   “We were bombed, we were shelled. We were in a completely destroyed city. A city that is practically wiped off the face of the earth. We were exactly at the heart of the war,” he said.   In order to even reach the plant, a ceasefire had to be implemented.    On April 27, Kovalov was pictured in a photograph that resembled a scene from a spy movie. The image captured Kovalov with Kryzhanovsky and Lt. Gen Andrey Sychevoy, of the 8th Guards Combined Arms Army of Russia’s Southern Military District, sitting in the middle of the road around a small table.    Kovalov said he sat all day with the general, nicknamed “Don.” Sychevoy was responsible for leading the assault on Mariupol, and is rumored to have replaced Col. Gen. Alexander Zhuravlyov after the initial faltering stages of the war; he was also sanctioned by the EU for his military actions in Ukraine.  While the photo of the meeting made it seem like everything was calm, Kovalov said: “In fact everything was exploding. We did everything for Azovstal to make it quiet.”   The civilians were a priority, their desperate pleas and worsening health having gripped the world’s attention.     Kovalov played up his role in their eventual release, telling CNN he helped convince “the other side that saving, first of all, children, women and the wounded, will be an act of sanity, an act of humanism.”   In early May, the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross evacuated hundreds of civilians from Azovstal and other areas of the port city in a series of operations, which UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as “complex.” On May 7, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vershchuk said that “all women, children and elderly people” had safely been taken out of the steel plant.   But the soldiers remained and Russian strikes on the plant started up again.   Oleksandr Kovalov, left, meets with Russian Lt. Gen Andrey Sychevoy, middle, and his FSB contact Valentin Kryzhanovsky, right, on a deserted road in Mariupol on April 27.Courtesy Oleksandr KovaliovKovalov returned to Mariupol and the negotiating table on May 9, celebrated as “Victory Day” in Russia. This time the negotiations from both sides were kicked up a gear, he said.    By this point, Budanov had insisted on his representatives being at the meetings and dispatched top deputy Dmitrii Usov. The Russians decided they needed to up their game too.    Kovalov said he wasn’t surprised to see Russian generals Alexseyev and Zorin at the negotiating table. “This process was counted as a special operation,” outside of the war, Kovalov said. These talks needed a special touch.   Christo Grozev, from the online investigative group Bellingcat, who has tracked the activities of Russian security services and their operations abroad for years, said Alexseyev’s presence makes sense. “Alexseyev  is the Ukraine war man for the GRU. He’s fully entrusted with everything regarding the war,” he told CNN.     CNN shared two photos of the meetings with Grozev, and he confirmed that the images appear to be Alexseyev and Zorin.    According to Kovalov, Alexseyev would take regular breaks from the May 9 negotiations to call Moscow. He had a “direct satellite connection” with the Russian defense ministry, Kovalov understood.     “Alexseyev  is very high on the food chain,” Grozev said. “I think he can report directly to (Nikolai) Patrushev,” the head of Russia’s Security Council. Patrushev, in turn, reports directly to Putin.   CNN reached out to Russia’s Defense Ministry for comment on the negotiations. ‘A moment of trust’  As negotiations progressed further, a third visit to Mariupol was arranged and one of the more remarkable scenes of the war unfolded – a meeting between Russian generals who were directing the bloody war and the Ukrainian officers who Moscow have depicted as “neo-Nazis.” On the morning of May 16, Kovalov recorded a video approaching one of the entrances to Azovstal. Zorin and Alexseyev are visible on the walk up to the battered plant. Warped metal pipes and debris litter the ground on an otherwise perfect sunny day.    Kovalov was part of several negotiations including a meeting between Ukrainian and Russian delegations conducted at one of the entrances to Azovstal.Courtesy Oleksandr KovaliovIn the videos and images, the Russian delegation is met by a group of at least six Ukrainian soldiers, including Lt. Col. Denys Prokopenko, head of the Azov Battalion, whom Moscow has regularly accused of being part of Ukraine’s far right, or “Nazi” movement.    “These are the moments that we were worried about,” Kovalov said. “A moment of trust. When we did everything so that the two sides came together, looked into each other’s eyes, the Russian side promised that there would be a civilized exit for our soldiers.”    Kovalov said that when the negotiations started in earnest, the terms were simple: the Ukrainian fighters would stop fighting, give up the plant and be taken into Russian custody.   “Here were conditions for a mutual ceasefire, a civilized surrender of Azovstal, civilized conditions for our prisoners of war, and an exchange,” he said.    The agreement was implemented without a hitch, Kovalov said. Later that day, those most severely injured were removed from the plant on stretchers.    That evening, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister announced that the evacuation of Ukrainian soldiers from Azovstal had begun. Hanna Maliar said 53 injured soldiers had been taken to a Russian hospital, and 200 had been moved to a detention center in Olenivka, in the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR).  Out of Azovstal but into Russian hands  The following day, May 17, at around noon, a seemingly endless stream of soldiers began their procession into captivity – gaunt and pale, many on crutches or stretchers, others limping and some seriously maimed.     Kovalov said it was deeply unpleasant to see the Ukrainian troops in that condition, but it also underscored the necessity of the deal. “They demanded help, and we did everything to get this help to them. Seeing how they left Azovstal, I realized that our efforts were not in vain.”    Videos showed the soldiers, both men and women, dropping their rifles in the back of pick-up trucks and immediately becoming prisoners. Then, they were shipped off to the agreed location of Olenivka. Other locations were initially floated, according to Kovalov, such as the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant near Enerhodar, but there wasn’t enough room there.    Kovalov was able to gain access to the soldiers on May 18 in the DPR. There he shot video of their living conditions, and the doctors who were on hand for their treatment. This was the last time he saw them.   Two months later, on July 29, a mysterious explosion at the Olenivka detention center left more than 50 prisoners of war dead, including fighters who had surrendered at Azovstal. Russia and Ukraine traded blame for the deadly attack, with Moscow accusing Kyiv of using a US-supplied rocket launcher known as HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) to kill its own troops, in a strike intended to stop the soldiers from sharing information.    Ukraine vehemently denied the claims, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling it a “deliberate war crime by the Russians.” A CNN investigation found that the Russian version of events was very likely a fabrication, and that there was almost no chance that a HIMARS rocket caused the damage to the warehouse where the prisoners were being held.  Today, about 2,000 Azovstal fighters remain imprisoned at locations in the DPR, but most are in Russia, according to Kovalov. He says he is still working to get them home, perhaps through one of the prisoner swaps that happen regularly.     “They demand help, they ask for it through their relatives. We are planning and doing everything to get to them,” he said.    While Kovalov said he quickly handed off much of the negotiating on Azovstal to Ukrainian intelligence officials, he has been recognized for his work by the government.   In a letter to the head of the Ukrainian parliament, shared with CNN by Kovalov, military intelligence chief Budanov wrote: “Kovalov provided important and invaluable support to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.”    The lawmaker risked “endangering his own life and health, was the only one who accompanied the defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal to their places of detention … which in itself is a great deed,” Budanov said.   Budanov’s office declined to comment on the record about Kovalov’s involvement, but Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, GUR, did confirm that Dmitrii Usov took part in the talks.   Back in his office on the eve of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kovalov played down his involvement.    “This is a general success, not just mine. The most important thing in these negotiations is saving the lives of our fighters, our heroes, like our president said: use every opportunity to save our people.”   That success is nuanced. Mariupol is under Russian control and most of the Azovstal fighters remain prisoners of war, though Kovalov said further talks are planned to try to secure their release.   Still, Kovalov hopes the story of Azovstal, which is indelible in the Ukrainian national psyche for its horror and scale, shows that opportunities for negotiations between the warring parties – though narrow – are possible.    “Communication bridges work, not everything is lost in this life, you can still be a human. Even at war,” he added.    Clarification: A previous version of this story misstated where Azovstal fighters are imprisoned by Russian forces.

Federal budgetPresident Joe Biden is set to release his 2024 budget today, laying out his policy vision for the year ahead. The new budget will cut the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the next 10 years, the White House announced on Wednesday. Advisers stress that the budget reflects his fiscal vision – with significant investments in manufacturing, climate, education, paid leave and health care, all paired with a menu of tax increases on corporations and wealthier Americans. It will also include cuts to “wasteful spending on special interests, like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. The deficit reduction will be a central part of Biden’s budget proposal and a symbolic marker as the president approaches the showdown with House Republicans over the looming debt ceiling crisis.2. Winter stormMillions across central and Northern California are bracing for an alarming storm beginning today, with heavy rain threatening to cause widespread flooding in areas grappling with dayslong snowfall. More than 17 million people are under flood watches in California and slices of Nevada, with much of the Golden State under an especially significant risk of excessive rainfall that could swamp some of the same areas already devastated by severe flooding earlier this year. The most vulnerable areas for flooding are creeks and streams in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, the Weather Prediction Center said. A total of 34 of California’s 58 counties are now under a state of emergency issued by the governor’s office due to recent storms and this week’s severe weather.

UkraineAt least 11 people were killed after Russia targeted critical infrastructure across Ukraine with more than 80 missile strikes today, officials said. Following the strikes, 15% of Kyiv went without electricity temporarily, according to an official in the region. As crews work to restore power, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian assault was “an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians again” and to “terrorize civilians.” Separately, Georgia’s ruling party has withdrawn a controversial “foreign influence” bill that sparked two nights of widespread protests in the capital Tbilisi. The bill had been compared to a draconian set of laws adopted in Russia and condemned by rights groups as a bid to curtail basic freedoms and crack down on dissent in the country.

In part, this is because food producers, which started raising prices a few years ago, have other expenses that remain pricey – like labor and transportation. But critics and industry experts say the cost increases during the pandemic gave food makers cover to hike prices above what those increases called for, boosting profits and correcting what they saw as too-low prices in previous years. Between January 2022 and January 2023, groceries got 11.3% more expensive. Many food companies are forecasting that they might slow down or pause price increases – but not lower them. “Companies view these as occasional opportunities, and they don’t want to miss out,” said Jean-Pierre Dubé, a marketing professor at the University of Chicago.5. Instagram outageInstagram was back up for most users after a global outage, the photo-sharing platform said early today, adding that an hourslong technical issue has been resolved. “Earlier tonight, a technical issue caused people to have trouble accessing Instagram. We resolved this issue for everyone as quickly as possible,” Instagram said in a tweet. Downdetector, which tracks outages, reported more than 53,000 incidents of users being unable to access Instagram at the peak of the outage. As Instagram was coming back online, Downdetector said reports of outages had fallen below 1,000 in the US and under 100 reports in the UK, India, Japan and Australia.BREAKFAST BROWSECNN reporter calls his parents using AI voice.

But the California Republican’s decision to turn down Volodymyr Zelensky’s invitation, made in an exclusive interview with CNN, is in keeping with the central premise of his speakership – appeasing the GOP radicals who keep him in power.  But as with his handling of a looming debt ceiling crisis and his efforts to help Tucker Carlson whitewash the Capitol insurrection, McCarthy’s unwillingness to cross lawmakers who want to cut Ukraine’s US lifeline may simply be storing up future national crises that could threaten his hold on power.  His precarious position is fast becoming a dominant feature of a critical period of divided government that will define McCarthy’s political career and go a long way toward shaping the 2024 White House race and the legacy of President Joe Biden.  The volatile dynamics of the House GOP and the way McCarthy’s tiny majority gives outsize influence to the most committed “Make America Great Again” loyalists is also complicating his efforts to train undivided attention on Biden’s new budget to be released Thursday.  Left to right, Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy, Tucker CarlsonTrump, McCarthy and Fox run out a new truth-defying playbookModerate Republicans who helped the GOP win the majority last November are just as important to the party’s hopes of retaining control of the chamber next year as pro-Trump extremists. But their priorities risk being constantly compromised by the speaker’s repeated plays to Trump’s base and the ex-president’s most devoted followers in the House.  McCarthy’s balancing act is so far working for him politically. His decision to give January 6 conspiracist Carlson access to US Capitol security tapes sparked a torrent of criticism from the media and some Republican senators, but that counts as a political win with the MAGA crowd. A House Republican resolution blocking a controversial Washington, DC, crime measure, which also passed the Senate Wednesday, caused a split between progressive Democrats and the president, who declined to veto it. And there’s no immediate bill for billions more in aid for Ukraine that could widen the chasm between far-right lawmakers and GOP committee chairmen who want Biden to send more arms and ammunition into the proxy war against Russia in Ukraine.  But at some point – possibly in the looming summer showdown over raising the government’s borrowing authority, which the GOP refuses to do without Biden agreeing to transformative spending cuts – McCarthy’s strategy could fail in a battle between US interests and the speaker’s political needs.Don’t expect to see McCarthy in Kyiv any time soonAlmost every Western leader who matters, and many who don’t, have now made the daring trip to visit Zelensky, a hero of democracy, in Kyiv.  Yet McCarthy, who has a reputation for loving a photo-op with famous people, rebuffed the invitation to visit the Ukrainian leader.  “Mr. McCarthy, he has to come here to see how we work, what’s happening here, what war caused us, which people are fighting now, who are fighting now. And then after that, make your assumptions,” Zelensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.  But the California Republican told CNN on Tuesday he had no plans to visit and reiterated the illogical position that Biden had been too slow to help Ukraine but that he would not preside over a “blank check” in assistance for Zelensky’s government. McCarthy’s bridging of two adamant strands of opinion in the House GOP on Ukraine is just about holding.  Zelensky and McCarthyGetty ImagesExclusive: Zelensky invites House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine “Let’s be very clear about what I said: no blank checks, OK? So, from that perspective, I don’t have to go to Ukraine to understand where there’s a blank check or not,” McCarthy told CNN. “I will continue to get my briefings and others, but I don’t have to go to Ukraine or Kyiv to see it.”  Zelensky is a shrewd politician who has expertly evoked the history and national mythology of Western nations as he has solicited help in repelling Russia’s invasion – for instance, comparing the onslaught to attacks on US soil at Pearl Harbor and on September 11, 2001. McCarthy would be put in a deeply awkward position if he stood alongside the Ukrainian leader in his wartime capital and repeated his line about allowing no “blank checks.”  But making the trip is effectively a political impossibility with his political patron, Trump, accusing Biden of caring more about Ukraine’s borders than America’s. Sooner or later, though, McCarthy may face a choice between the GOP hardliners and the prospect of voting down a future funding bill that Ukraine needs to survive against the Russian assault. Because of concessions he made to win the speakership, it’s not clear he could use Democratic votes without provoking a GOP revolt from hardliners in his conference that could cost him his job.    Critics might hope he’d put principle – defending a pro-Western leader who has risked everything and a democracy Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to obliterate – ahead of his political viability. But that’s not an approach he’s taken at home following Trump’s lies about a stolen election in 2020.  Still, McCarthy hasn’t fully adopted demands of his most radical subordinates, like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, for audits or an end to Ukraine aid. His line about a blank check could be interpreted as a holding position between his extremist colleagues and hawkish internationalist Republicans who want to do more.  But with Russia only escalating its assault and the GOP presidential primary likely to drag the party toward the anti-aid faction, it’s a position that may crumble before much longer.McCarthy’s budget balancing actThe speaker is not only treading a dicey path on Ukraine. His strategy heading into a monumental showdown over spending and debt is one that sustains him for now but will require a series of political masterstrokes for him to come out ahead in a head-to-head with Biden.  If Congress does not raise the government’s current $31.4 trillion borrowing limit later this year, the government will be unable to fulfill its obligations. There could be delays to Social Security payments, military wages and tax refunds. But Republicans in the House are refusing to act unless Biden agrees to steep spending cuts, and McCarthy apparently gave undertakings to stand firm when he needed the support of GOP budget hawks to finally win the speakership after 15 rounds of chaotic voting in January.  Biden is refusing to negotiate, arguing that the debt limit increase is needed to pay for obligations already racked up by Congress and that the GOP previously voted to raise it several times under the free-spending Trump.  BALTIMORE, MARYLAND - MARCH 1: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during the annual House Democrats Issues Conference at the Hyatt Regency Hotel March 1, 2023 in Baltimore, Maryland. Biden spoke on a range of issues, including bipartisan legislation passed in the first two years of his presidency.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesRepublicans eye transformational cuts as Biden seeds a tax hike. Nobody will get exactly what they wantRepublicans have every right to seek to cut spending. They won the House in the midterm election, albeit narrowly, on their vow to rein in government largesse. But the White House and many financial experts fault them over the debt limit stance because failing to act could shatter the credibility of America’s credit and pitch the global economy into a disaster.  McCarthy has so far shown no clear path through this game of Russian roulette. And he’s blaming Biden for not caving into him on his pledge not to negotiate.  “He told me once that he would, I believe eventually he will, but that’s a month wasted. That’s a month that brings more doubt financially. That’s a month that hurts Americans,” McCarthy told reporters on Wednesday evening.  McCarthy is betting Biden will blink. The White House insists he will not. And the prosperity and livelihoods of millions of Americans may be on the line.New fury over release of January 6 tapesHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise on Wednesday accused reporters of being obsessed with the mob assault by Trump supporters on Congress.

So do a lot of Democrats,” the Louisiana Republican said.   But it was McCarthy who ignited the latest controversy over the insurrection by giving Carlson exclusive access to thousands of hours of surveillance tapes, allowing the Fox host to cherry pick excerpts that bolstered his effort to hide the truth of what happened. And it’s House Republicans who are talking about that day, with Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who chairs a House Administration subcommittee, telling CNN he will examine how the “January 6 committee dropped the ball on what actually happened here in the Capitol.”   U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) walks to a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 7, 2023. REUTERS/Elizabeth FrantzElizabeth Frantz/ReutersHouse GOP plots new January 6 probes despite internal backlash over McCarthy giving Carlson footageRepublicans have consistently attempted to put the blame for the most serious attack on US democracy in decades on security failures rather than a president who incited an angry crowd with lies about election fraud and sent them marching to the Capitol with a call to “fight like hell” ringing in their ears.  But the MAGA wing of the party’s rewriting of the history of January 6 threatens to perpetuate the very anti-democratic extremism that contributed to Trump’s 2020 election loss and that alienated swing-state voters in the 2022 midterms, thereby saddling McCarthy with such a thin majority.  Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington state, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the 2021 insurrection, told CNN Wednesday that Fox News and some in his party were wrong to try to rewrite what happened on January 6.  “It’s a revisionist thing that I think is unfair to the American people,” he said.  The radical House Republicans using their power to try to reshape the narrative about Trump’s assault on democracy, just as he takes a new tilt at the White House, do not just reflect the character of the new GOP majority.  It encapsulates the compromises that McCarthy has made to win power. But on Ukraine and debt at least, the time may be approaching when he faces painful choices that could decide how long he can keep the job he fought so hard to win – and that will shape America’s future at home and abroad.

It is not the first time Moscow has deployed its Kinzhal hypersonic missile during its invasion, but it does appear to be a relatively rare occurrence.   Russia said it used Kinzhal missiles Ukraine in mid-March – a claim later confirmed by US officials to CNN – in the first known use of the weapon in combat.  In March, US President Joe Biden confirmed Russia’s use of the Kinzhal missile, describing it as “a consequential weapon … it’s almost impossible to stop it. There’s a reason they’re using it.”  Biden’s defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has downplayed the effectiveness of the missile, telling CBS in March that he “would not see it as a game-changer.”  And the UK defense ministry has previously said the Kinzhal missile is really just an air-launched version of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), which Russia has used repeatedly in its war on Ukraine.  Here’s what to know. Why the fear and hype about hypersonic missiles?First, it’s important to understand the term.   Essentially, all ballistic missiles are hypersonic – which means they travel at least five times the speed of sound. Almost any warhead released from a rocket miles in the atmosphere will reach this speed heading to its target. It is not a new technology.  What military powers – including Russia, China, the United States and North Korea – are working on now is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). An HGV is a highly maneuverable payload that can theoretically fly at hypersonic speed while adjusting course and altitude to fly under radar detection and around missile defenses.  An HGV is the weapon that’s almost impossible to stop. And Russia is thought to have an HGV in its arsenal, the Avangard system, which Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 called “practically invulnerable” to Western air defenses.

While it does have limited maneuverability like the Iskander, its main advantage is that it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions, according to a report last year from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  “The MiG-31K can strike from unpredictable directions and could avoid interception attempts altogether. The flying carrier vehicle might also be more survivable than the road-mobile Iskander system,” the report said.  The same report also noted that the ground-launched Iskander proved vulnerable to missile defense systems during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, during which Azeri forces intercepted an Armenian Iskander.  “This suggests that claims of the Kinzhal’s invulnerability to missile defense systems may also be somewhat exaggerated,” the report said.Does Ukraine have missile defenses?The United States and its NATO allies are already sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense.  According to a senior US official in March, these additional systems included the Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems.  NATO member Slovakia has also sent more modern S-300 missile defense batteries to Ukraine.   In April, the United Kingdom promised £100 million ($123 million) worth of high-grade military equipment, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. Weeks later, Germany said it would supply 50 anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine.   And the US is preparing a mammoth $40 billion aid package that would include additional anti-aircraft capabilities for the Ukrainian military. Why did Putin use the Kinzhal missile?Use in Ukraine marks the combat debut for Russia’s Kinzhal system.  “On March 18, the Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse of missiles and aviation ammunition of Ukrainian troops in the village of Delyatin, Ivano-Frankivsk region,” Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.  (220202) -- WASHINGTON, Feb. 2, 2022 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrives to attend a closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., the United States, on Feb. 2, 2022. The United States will deploy additional troops to Europe, the Defense Department announced Wednesday, citing tensions on Ukraine's borders. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua) (Photo by Xinhua/Sipa USA)Ting Shen/Xinhua/Sipa USAPentagon urges CEOs of largest defense companies to accelerate hypersonic weapons development as US lags behind ChinaUS officials later confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine and were able to track the launches in real time.  The launches in March were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message to the West about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN.  At that point, the war on the ground in Ukraine had become something of a stalemate. Russia may have been looking for victories it could tout.    The UK defense ministry said at the time that Moscow probably deployed the Kinzhal to “detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign.” Austin, the US defense secretary, used similar language in his CBS interview in March, saying Putin was”trying to reestablish some momentum.”  By the end of March, the US assessed that Russian forces were running low on air-launched cruise missiles, according to a US defense official, who said there were indications that Russia was trying to preserve that inventory as part of its declining stocks of precision guided munitions.    Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that virtually all ballistic missiles -- not missiles in general -- are hypersonic.  CNN’s Brad Lendon wrote and reported from Seoul.

But a tentative €2 billion ($2.1 billion) European Union plan to procure ammunition for war-torn Ukraine may provide just that.  EU defense ministers wrapped up a two-day summit in Sweden this week. The outcome was a provisional agreement to jointly buy 155-millimeter artillery shells desperately needed by Kyiv, and send more artillery rounds to Ukraine from EU countries’ existing stockpiles.    Speaking in Stockholm Wednesday, Ukraine’s Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his country needed one million rounds of ammunition “as soon as possible” to deter Russian forces.   A final decision is expected on March 20 when EU foreign and defense ministers meet in Brussels.  The Russia-Ukraine war marks the first time the European Union has supplied lethal weapons to a third country, underscoring the extent of the threat it believes Moscow poses to its security.   “I think that many countries have had a wake-up call, and need to replenish and increase their stocks,” Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defense contractor Saab, told CNN.   “This will continue for a number of years to come.”    Investors have spotted the opportunity, piling into defense stocks in recent months as Ukraine’s allies have upped their military support, and as some of its donors seek to replenish their thinning stocks.   The STOXX Europe Total Market Aerospace and Defense index, which tracks 25 leading defense companies, has climbed 41% since late September, outperforming the region’s broader benchmark index, the Stoxx Europe 600, by 18 percentage points.   The MSCI World Aerospace and Defense Index, a global benchmark, rose nearly 26% over the same period. Walking the talk As Ukraine’s war with Russia rages on into a second year, the European Union — alongside the United States and the United Kingdom, Kyiv’s other two main backers — has reaffirmed its solidarity with Ukraine.   That solidarity has translated into further commitments on military spending in recent weeks.  In early February, the bloc announced that it would inject another €545 million ($575 million) into its €3.6 billion ($3.8 billion) military assistance fund for Ukraine. And in January, Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom agreed to supply modern battle tanks to Kyiv, responding to a longstanding call by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite fears that such a move could inflame the West’s tensions with Russia.

Sascha Schuermann/Getty ImagesBAE Systems    (BAESF), Europe’s largest defense contractor by revenue, logged record orders worth £37 billion ($44 billion) last year, though the majority were related to programs predating the war.   And more is coming down the pike. Brad Greve, the UK company’s chief financial officer, told investors last week that he expected the impact of restocking “will come later as governments convert demand into firm orders.”  “[It is] a factor which could contribute to a longer growth cycle for the industry,” he added.   BAE shares are up 55% since Russia invaded Ukraine a little over a year ago. The company forecasts that its earnings-per-share — a measure of profitability -— will increase by between 5% and 7% over 2023.   Johansson at Saab told CNN that orders directly connected to Ukraine started to pick up in December.  “More is definitely coming,” he added, noting that Western governments were spending more on their defense and security amid a “quite dramatic” ramp-up in geopolitical tensions.   Johansson expects Saab’s sales to grow 15% this year, although he said he hoped for an end to the war soon.    In Germany, Rheinmetall    (RNMBF), the country’s biggest arms manufacturer, told the Rheinische Post newspaper Monday that it hoped to open a €200 million ($211 million) battle tank factory in Ukraine, capable of producing about 400 tanks a year — a sign that defense companies are expecting strong demand for years to come.   In the near term at least, a let-up in government orders is unlikely.   “Ukraine should get all the necessary military equipment and training it needs to defend its territory,” Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign affairs and security chief, said in a statement last month.   “[The EU] will continue supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes and as long as it is needed.”  — Stephanie Halasz, Radina Gigova and Inke Kappeler contributed reporting.

Next, it could weaponize exports of important metals such as aluminum and palladium, researchers at Citigroup have warned.  Prices of these commodities could spike as a result, the bank said in a note to clients dated March 6.  “Any restrictions on exports could have major implications for markets in the short run,” Citi’s analysts wrote.  Such curbs would disrupt operations for manufacturers around the world. They could also fan already-high inflation.  About 15% of traded aluminum comes from Russia, according to Citi. The widely-used metal can be found in airplanes and products ranging from household appliances to foil and kitchen utensils.  The United States has announced a 200% tariff on imports of the metal from Russia. It takes effect Friday.  Russia’s output of palladium, which is used in devices that limit emissions from cars, is said to account for about a quarter of global supply.   Moscow has shown a readiness to use Russia’s vast natural resources to hit back at the West, which has enacted unprecedented sanctions in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago.  For example, last year Russia made deep cuts to its natural gas exports to Europe, its top customer. That forced governments in the region to ramp up efforts to find new suppliers.  Russia has also been accused of weaponizing global food supplies by blockading Ukraine’s Black Sea ports in the first few months of the war and targeting agricultural infrastructure, disrupting the supply of grain to world markets.  Russia’s role in the global nuclear power industry is also under the microscope. The country is a key exporter of nuclear fuel and its nuclear sector has so far mostly escaped Western sanctions.

The announcement that the bill would be scrapped, carried by the country’s public broadcaster, was made hours after tens of thousands of people gathered outside the Georgian parliament for a second night of rallies, some clashing with police.  The Executive Secretary of the Droa opposition party, Giga Lemonjala, said his party “did not believe” the ruling Georgian Dream party would withdraw the legislation, “because we have very sad experience that Georgian Dream has lied to the Georgian public several times.”   Lemonjala  is demanding parliament formally cancels the bill and immediately release all those detained during the protests, which saw tens of thousands gather outside the country’s parliament over a fear it would drive a wedge between Georgia and Europe.

The controversial legislation would have required organizations receiving 20% or more of their annual income from abroad to register as “foreign agents” or face heavy fines – a proposal that rights experts warn will pose a chilling effect to civil society in the country and damage its democracy.  Meanwhile, Moscow on Thursday expressed concern over the situation and urged Russian nationals to exercise caution. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday advised Russian nationals staying in neighboring countries to remain vigilant.  Asked on a press briefing if the Russian law had inspired the Georgian bill, Peskov said the Kremlin has “nothing to do with this” and pointed to legislation against so-called foreign agents in the US.  Critics said it resembled similar laws used by Russia to stifle dissent and political opposition and the announcement to shelve the bill was welcomed by the European Union’s office in the former Soviet Republic.  “We encourage all political leaders in GE (Georgia) to resume pro-EU reforms, in an inclusive & constructive way,” the office wrote on its official Twitter account.  Social media videos from Wednesday night showed some protesters throwing stones at the building’s windows and attempting to break a protective barrier, with police deploying water cannon and tear gas.  The Georgian Interior Ministry said it had arrested a further 66 people for their involvement in the protests.  “The participants of the rally violated the public order and law and order throughout the night at different locations and resisted the police officers,” the statement read.   The announcement brings the total number of people arrested in connection to the protests, which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, to 142.

The first bill would have required organizations including non-governmental groups and print, online and broadcast media to register as “foreign agents” if they receive 20 percent or more of their annual income from abroad.   The second expanded the scope of “agents of foreign influence” to include individuals and increases the penalties for failure to comply from fines to up to five years in prison.  Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the ruling Georgian Dream party said Wednesday that the laws would help root out those working against the interests of the country and the powerful Georgian Orthodox Church, Reuters reported.  He criticised Georgia’s “radical opposition” for stirring up protesters.  But Gogia said the the bills were a clear threat to human rights in Georgia.

Vano Shlamov/AFP/Getty Images“They threaten to marginalize and discredit critical voices in the country. This threat is real,” he said. “Under the disguise of transparency, the latest statements by the Georgian authorities strongly suggest that if adopted, the law will be weaponized to further stigmatize and penalize independent groups, media and critical voices in the country.”  Russia-aligned Belarus has had a citizenship law in place since 2002 that has a similar impact.   In December 2022, the Belarusian parliament passed amendments to the law which would enable the government to target members of the political opposition, activists and other critics in exile, according to Human Rights Watch.  The draft law would allow the president to strip Belarusians abroad of their citizenship, even if they have no other.Georgia’s balancing actGeorgia, which won its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, has long played a delicate balancing act between its citizens’ pro-European sentiment and the geopolitical aims of its powerful neighbor, Russia.  A Tuesday statement from the EU warned that the law would be “incompatible with EU values and standards” and could have “serious repercussions” on the group’s relations with Georgia.   Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said she believed that the bill “looks very much like Russian politics” and vowed to veto it.   “There is no need for this law, it comes from nowhere. Nobody has asked for it,” Zourabichvili told CNN’s Isa Soares Wednesday.

Georgia applied for EU membership in March 2022. Though it was not granted candidacy status, the European Council has expressed readiness to grant that status if Georgia implements certain reforms.  US State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday said the bill was “Kremlin-inspired.”   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile addressed Georgian protesters directly, thanking them on Wednesday for raising his country’s flag during the demonstrations and wishing them “democratic success.”  “I want to thank everyone who has been holding Ukrainian flags in the squares and streets of Georgia these days,” Zelensky said.

View more opinion on CNN.CNN      The Biden administration will soon make a final decision on a major oil drilling project in Alaska — the Willow Project. As the state’s congressional delegation — two Republicans and one Democrat — we represent Alaskans who are united in strong support of the project and urging its swift reapproval.   We all recognize the need for cleaner energy, but there is a major gap between our capability to generate it and our daily needs. Even those who practice a subsistence lifestyle in Alaska — living primarily off the land and water — rely on boats, snowmachines and ATVs, and those all need fuel. In rural parts of our state, gasoline prices have been as high as $18 a gallon. That is crippling — both for our economy and for the practice of traditional livelihoods, which new energy supplies will only help.   We need affordable energy today, and we will need it well into the future. And both are reasons why Willow matters.    First, the basics.    Aerial view of Nuiqsut, AK on May 28, 2019.Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesBiden administration takes another step toward advancing a controversial oil drilling project in AlaskaWillow is in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), an area in northwest Alaska roughly the size of Indiana. In 1976, Congress re-designated the area explicitly for environmentally responsible resource development. That occurs based on sound science and the best available technology, and is carried out in careful balance with the subsistence and economic needs of Alaska Native communities on our North Slope.   The project’s developer, ConocoPhillips, says it has paid approximately $120 million to the federal government for lease acquisition and rental costs, which it started to acquire during the Clinton-Gore administration. After a decade of preliminary environmental studies, the company listened as the Obama-Biden administration urged development in the petroleum reserve and ultimately applied to develop Willow in 2018.   More than five years later, after several rounds of environmental analysis, career civil servants at the Bureau of Land Management have recommended Willow’s approval with some modifications to reduce the project size and footprint.  Now, the question is whether the Biden-Harris administration recognizes that Willow will dramatically benefit the Alaska Native people who live on the North Slope, our state’s stagnant economy and our nation’s energy security — all while creating hundreds of permanent jobs and thousands of temporary ones, and generating fewer emissions than imported oil.  This should be an easy decision. The administration has made combating climate change a priority, while also acknowledging that the transition to cleaner energy will take time. In the meantime, we need oil, and compared to the other countries we can source it from, we believe Willow is by far the most environmentally responsible choice.  In total, the Bureau of Land Management’s preferred project will impact just 429 acres, which is a tiny fraction of the 23-million-acre petroleum reserve. The Biden administration has separately blocked surface development on 11 million acres of NPR-A, meaning that Alaskans are asking to develop an area of land 25,600 times smaller than what has been placed off limits.   FILE - This 2019 aerial photo provided by ConocoPhillips shows an exploratory drilling camp at the proposed site of the Willow oil project on Alaska's North Slope. The Biden administration is weighing approval of a major oil project on Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope that supporters say represents an economic lifeline for Indigenous communities in the region but environmentalists say is counter to Biden's climate goals. A decision on ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project, in a federal oil reserve roughly the size of Indiana, could come by early March 2023. (ConocoPhillips via AP, File)ConocoPhillips/APWhat to know about the controversial Willow oil drilling project in AlaskaWillow is meticulously planned and will be developed safely. It will adhere to hundreds of lease stipulations and best practices — including the use of ice roads and underground extended reach drilling —  to minimize impacts.   Despite its small size, the project will still deliver immense benefits. According to ConocoPhillips, it will provide 2,500 construction jobs, 75% of which will be union jobs. According to the Bureau of Land Management’s estimates, the government revenues it generates over the life of the project, up to $17 billion, will be split among the federal government, the state of Alaska and indigenous North Slope communities — helping to pay for roads, schools, medical clinics and basic infrastructure, and potentially contributing to further gains in the life expectancy of Alaska Natives.  Because of its small footprint and enormous benefits, many indigenous subsistence hunters and whalers in the region strongly support Willow. North Slope residents, primarily the Inupiaq people, have voiced their strong desire to see it move forward, as have the Alaska Federation of Natives, the bipartisan Alaska State Legislature, and state and national labor groups.  The administration has made social justice and racial equity priorities. There is no greater example than the indigenous population of the North Slope asking for this economic development to benefit all their people through self-determination.  Another reason to approve Willow is that it will boost our nation’s energy security. We can learn not just from Europe’s example with Russia but also from California, which has imported more as Alaska’s production has declined. California’s recent actions — importing from Saudi Arabia, then Russia, and most recently from countries drilling in the Amazon rainforest — are a recipe for the empowerment of OPEC+ and needless environmental devastation beyond our borders.  The reality, as President Joe Biden has acknowledged, is that the world will need oil for some time to come. Even under best case net-zero emission scenarios, the world is projected to use 75 million barrels per day in 2030 and nearly 23 million barrels per day in 2050.   If Willow is rejected, emissions won’t magically go down. That’s because the US will have to import more oil from elsewhere — like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia — at higher cost, with greater environmental impact, and at untold risk to our national security. This is clearly reflected in the Department of Interior’s environmental assessment.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook The reapproval of Willow is not a violation of President Biden’s pledge to restrict new oil leasing, either. The project was already approved when he took office. Its reapproval, following a lawsuit, would help signal the administration is serious about both climate and energy policy, understands Alaska’s economic needs and has heard the vast majority who support it.  Alaskans are not ignorant about our changing climate. We are on the front lines and see the impacts every day. Still, we know that clean energy cannot manifest overnight. We have to work our way there.   As we do, we must prioritize American energy to meet our continuing needs. There’s no better way to do that than through oil responsibly produced from a petroleum reserve in Alaska, with a small environmental footprint, that significantly benefits the people who live there and support it as well as the rest of our great nation.   We hope President Biden and his team agree.

Cores of earth drilled from Siberian permafrost  have been analyzed to detect frozen viruses. Jean-Michel Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AMSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.CNN      Warmer temperatures in the Arctic are thawing the region’s permafrost — a frozen layer of soil beneath the ground — and potentially stirring viruses that, after lying dormant for tens of thousands of years, could endanger animal and human health.  While a pandemic unleashed by a disease from the distant past sounds like the plot of a sci-fi movie, scientists warn that the risks, though low, are underappreciated. Chemical and radioactive waste that dates back to the Cold War, which has the potential to harm wildlife and disrupt ecosystems, may also be released during thaws.  “There’s a lot going on with the permafrost that is of concern, and (it) really shows why it’s super important that we keep as much of the permafrost frozen as possible,” said Kimberley Miner, a climate scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.   Permafrost covers a fifth of the Northern Hemisphere, having underpinned the Arctic tundra and boreal forests of Alaska, Canada and Russia for millennia. It serves as a kind of time capsule, preserving — in addition to ancient viruses — the mummified remains of a number of extinct animals that scientist have been able to unearth and study in recent years, including two cave lion cubs and a woolly rhino.  The reason permafrost is a good storage medium isn’t just because it’s cold; it’s an oxygen-free environment that light doesn’t penetrate. But current day Arctic temperatures are warming up to four times faster than the rest of the planet, weakening the top layer of permafrost in the region.  To better understand the risks posed by frozen viruses, Jean-Michel Claverie, an Emeritus professor of medicine and genomics at the Aix-Marseille University School of Medicine in Marseille, France, has tested earth samples taken from Siberian permafrost to see whether any viral particles contained therein are still infectious. He’s in search of what he describes as “zombie viruses” — and he has found some.  Jean-Michel Claverie is pictured here working in the subsampling room at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Postsdam, where the cores of permafrost were kept.  Jean-Michel Claverie    The virus hunterClaverie studies a particular type of virus he first discovered in 2003. Known as giant viruses, they are much bigger than the typical variety and visible under a regular light microscope, rather than a more powerful electron microscope — which makes them a good model for this type of lab work.  His efforts to detect viruses frozen in permafrost were partly inspired by a team of Russian scientists who in 2012 revived a  wildflower from a 30,000-year-old seed tissue found in a squirrel’s burrow. (Since then, scientists have also successfully brought ancient microscopic animals back to life.)  In 2014, he managed to revive a virus he and his team isolated from the permafrost, making it infectious for the first time in 30,000 years by inserting it into cultured cells. For safety, he’d chosen to study a virus that could only target single-celled amoebas, not animals or humans.   He repeated the feat in 2015, isolating a different virus type that also targeted amoebas. And in his latest research, published February 18 in the journal Viruses, Claverie and his team isolated several strains of ancient virus from multiple samples of permafrost taken from seven different places across Siberia and showed they could each infect cultured amoeba cells.  This is a computer-enhanced microphoto of Pithovirus sibericum that was isolated from a 30,000-year-old sample of permafrost in 2014.Jean-Michel Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AMUThose latest strains represent five new families of viruses, on top of the two he had revived previously. The oldest was almost 48,500 years old, based on radiocarbon dating of the soil, and came from a sample of earth taken from an underground lake 16 meters (52 feet) below the surface. The youngest samples, found in the stomach contents and coat of a woolly mammoth’s remains, were 27,000 years old.  That amoeba-infecting viruses are still infectious after so long is indicative of a potentially bigger problem, Claverie said. He fears people regard his research as a scientific curiosity and don’t perceive the prospect of ancient viruses coming back to life as a serious public health threat.  “We view these amoeba-infecting viruses as surrogates for all other possible viruses that might be in the permafrost,” Claverie told CNN.  “We see the traces of many, many, many other viruses,” he added. “So we know they are there. We don’t know for sure that they are still alive. But our reasoning is that if the amoeba viruses are still alive, there is no reason why the other viruses will not be still alive, and capable of infecting their own hosts.”   Precedent for human infection Traces of viruses and bacteria that can infect humans have been found preserved in permafrost.  A lung sample from a woman’s body exhumed in 1997 from permafrost in a village on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska  contained genomic material from the influenza strain responsible for the 1918 pandemic. In 2012, scientists confirmed the 300-year-old mummified remains of a woman buried in Siberia contained the genetic signatures of the virus that causes smallpox.An anthrax outbreak in Siberia that affected dozens of humans and more than 2,000 reindeer between July and August in 2016 has also been linked to the deeper thawing of the permafrost during exceptionally hot summers, allowing old spores of Bacillus anthracis to resurface from old burial grounds or animal carcasses.  Birgitta Evengård, professor emerita at Umea University’s Department of Clinical Microbiology in Sweden, said there should be better surveillance of the risk posed by potential pathogens in thawing permafrost, but warned against an alarmist approach.  “You must remember our immune defense has been developed in close contact with microbiological surroundings,” said Evengård, who is part of the CLINF Nordic Centre of Excellence, a group that investigates the effects of climate change on the prevalence of infectious diseases in humans and animals in northern regions.   “If there is a virus hidden in the permafrost that we have not been in contact with for thousands of years, it might be that our immune defense is not sufficient,” she said. “It is correct to have respect for the situation and be proactive and not just reactive. And the way to fight fear is to have knowledge.”   A boat served as a canteen and storage space for the team that took cores that Claverie used in his experiments. Jean-Michel Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AM    Chances of viral spilloverOf course, in the real world, scientists don’t know how long these viruses could remain infectious once exposed to present-day conditions, or how likely the virus would be to encounter a suitable host. Not all viruses are pathogens that can cause disease; some are benign or even beneficial to their hosts. And while it is home to 3.6 million people, the Arctic is still a sparsely populated place, making the risk of human exposure to ancient viruses very low.  Still, “the risk is bound to increase in the context of global warming,” Claverie said, “in which permafrost thawing will keep accelerating, and more people will populate the Arctic in the wake of industrial ventures.”  And Claverie isn’t alone in warning that the region could become a fertile ground for a spillover event — when a virus jumps into a new host and starts to spread.  Last year, a team of scientists published research on samples of soil and lake sediment taken from Lake Hazen, a freshwater lake in Canada located within the Arctic circle. They sequenced the genetic material in the sediment to identify viral signatures and the genomes of potential hosts — plants and animals — in the area.  Using a computer model analysis, they suggested the risk of viruses spilling over to new hosts was higher at locations close to where large amounts of glacial meltwater flowed into the lake — a scenario that becomes more likely as the climate warms.  Cores of permafrost samples are pictured in a container. Jean-Michel Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AM    Unknown consequencesIdentifying viruses and other hazards contained in the warming permafrost is the first step in understanding what risk they pose to the Arctic, Miner at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said. Other challenges include quantifying where, when, how fast and how deep permafrost will thaw.  Thawing can be a gradual process of as little as centimeters per decade, but also happens more rapidly, such as in the case of massive land slumps that can suddenly expose deep and ancient layers of permafrost. The process also releases methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — an overlooked and underestimated driver of climate change.  Permafrost thaw can be gradual or happen much more quickly. Jean-Michel Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AMMiner cataloged an array of potential hazards currently frozen in Arctic permafrost in a 2021 paper published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change. Those possible dangers included buried waste from the mining of heavy metals and chemicals such as the pesticide DDT, which was banned in the early 2000s. Radioactive material has also been dumped in the Arctic — by Russia and the United States — since the advent of nuclear testing in the 1950s.  “Abrupt thaw rapidly exposes old permafrost horizons, releasing compounds and microorganisms sequestered in deeper layers,” Miner and other researchers noted in the 2021 paper.In the research paper, Miner labeled the direct infection of humans with ancient pathogens released from permafrost as “currently improbable.”   However, Miner said she is worried about what she termed “Methuselah microorganisms” (named after the Biblical figure with the longest life span). These are organisms that could bring the dynamics of ancient and extinct ecosystems into the present-day Arctic, with unknown consequences.  The re-emergence of ancient microorganisms has the potential to change soil composition and vegetative growth, possibly further accelerating the effects of climate change, Miner said.  “We’re really unclear as to how these microbes are going to interact with the modern environment,” she said. “It’s not really an experiment that I think any of us want to run.”  The best course of action, Miner said, is to try and halt the thaw, and the wider climate crisis, and keep these hazards entombed in the permafrost for good.

Watch the full exclusive interview  tonight at 9 p.m. ET.CNN      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is inviting House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine to see the situation on the ground first hand – an invitation that comes as the Republican Party faces a divide over whether the United States should continue to provide aid to the country under attack from Russia.  “Mr. McCarthy, he has to come here to see how we work, what’s happening here, what war caused us, which people are fighting now, who are fighting now. And then after that, make your assumptions,” Zelensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an exclusive interview.  But when told of the invitation on Tuesday, McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support “a blank check,” a position he repeated on Tuesday – even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there.   “I think that Speaker McCarthy, he never visited Kyiv or Ukraine, and I think it would help him with his position,” Zelensky said.   As speaker, McCarthy must navigate competing views within his party over sending additional assistance. There is widespread bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress, but some House Republicans are calling for an end to further military and financial aid to the country.   Getty ImagesAnalysis: Why the 2024 shadow campaign between Trump and DeSantis should worry Ukraine“Let’s be very clear about what I said: no blank checks, OK? So, from that perspective, I don’t have to go to Ukraine to understand where there’s a blank check or not,” McCarthy told CNN. “I will continue to get my briefings and others, but I don’t have to go to Ukraine or Kyiv to see it. And my point has always been, I won’t provide a blank check for anything.”  As the conflict in Ukraine unfolds, Zelensky has worked to rally support for his country as he continues to emphasize the need for aid. The Ukrainian president said that any lawmaker who visits can see the reality of what is happening in the war-torn country. Biden visited Kyiv in February in a show of support for Ukraine.  “When the Democrats and Republicans come to us, they see the supply roots – every shell, every bullet, every dollar,” Zelensky said.  Zelensky has expressed gratitude to the US for the aid it has provided as he has made appeals on behalf of Ukraine. Last year, he delivered a historic speech from the United States Capitol, arguing that support from the US “is crucial not just to stand in such (a) fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.”  Asked by Blitzer if he is concerned that pushback from some Republicans could threaten the flow of aid to the country, Zelensky praised the fact that there has been bipartisan support for Ukraine on Capitol Hill.  “Firstly, I would like to thank the bipartisan support of Ukraine – it’s very important,” Zelensky said.  “Recently, I had a meeting with representatives of the Republican Party and I’m thankful to the congressmen who visited Ukraine. They told me that they want to support Ukraine very much, like the Democrats,” he said.   Zelensky went on to say, “We don’t care about the side of the support as long as it’s powerful and constant.”  McCarthy has previously told CNN he does not support a resolution from GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida declaring congressional “fatigue” over supporting Ukraine, but McCarthy has also indicated he would not automatically rubber stamp any aid package the Biden administration requests – a sign that it will be more difficult to pass additional Ukraine funding under a GOP-led House.  CNN’s Lauren Fox, Melanie Zanona, Morgan Rimmer and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.

People take part in a demonstration outside Georgia's Parliament in Tbilisi on March 8, 2023 called by Georgian opposition and civil society groups against government plans to introduce controversial ""foreign agent"" legislation.Vano Shlamov/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the Georgian parliament on Wednesday in the second day of protests in capital city Tbilisi over a draft “foreign agents” bill that critics fear could drive a wedge between the Caucasian nation and Europe.  Protesters could be seen waving the flag of the European Union – which Georgia applied to join last year – and those of the United States and Ukraine, as well as the Georgian flag. Social media videos also showed some protesters throwing stones at the building’s windows and attempting to break a protective barrier, with police deploying water cannon and tear gas.   The controversial bill would require organizations receiving 20 percent or more of their annual income from abroad to register as “foreign agents” or face heavy fines – a proposal that rights experts warn will pose a chilling effect to civil society in the country and damage its democracy.  The ruling Georgian Dream party has said that the bill is modeled on US legislation, Reuters reports. But critics say it evokes a controversial law in neighboring Russia that forms the basis of draconian restrictions and requirements on organizations and individuals with foreign ties.  The bill passed a first reading on Tuesday in the legislature and faces several further steps before becoming law. Its ultimate passage is considered likely, however, as the bill has strong support among lawmakers.   In a statement on Wednesday, the Georgian Interior Ministry called “on the protesters, organizers and political leaders not to go beyond the limits defined by the law on freedom of assembly and expression.”   At least 76 people have been arrested in connection to Tuesday’s protests.

Vano Shlamov/AFP/Getty Images    Georgia’s balancing actGeorgia has long played a delicate balancing act between citizens’ pro-European sentiment and the geopolitical aims of its powerful neighbor, Russia.   But an EU statement Tuesday warned that the law would be “incompatible with EU values and standards” and could have “serious repercussions on our relations.”  Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said she believed that the bill “looks very much like Russian politics.”    “There is no need for this law, it comes from nowhere. Nobody has asked for it,” Zourabichvili told CNN’s Isa Soares Wednesday.  Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the bill. But supreme executive power lies with the government headed by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili.   Georgia applied for EU membership in March 2022. Though it was not granted candidacy status, the European Council has expressed readiness to grant that status if Georgia implements certain reforms.   “For Georgia, there has been certain conditions that are very much linked to the democratic credentials for democratic reforms,” European Union Vice Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič told CNN.  The bloc’s member states have since “had very intense discussions” about Georgia’s candidacy, Šefčovič said, speaking to CNN’s Richard Quest on Wednesday.  The US has said it is “deeply troubled” by the bill, with State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday describing it as “Kremlin-inspired.”   “Parliament’s advancing of these Kremlin-inspired draft laws is incompatible with the people of Georgia’s clear desire for European integration and its democratic development,” Price said.   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile addressed Georgian protesters directly, thanking them on Wednesday for raising his country’s flag during the demonstrations and wishing them “democratic success.”  “I want to thank everyone who has been holding Ukrainian flags in the squares and streets of Georgia these days,” Zelensky said.   “We want to be in the European Union and we will be. We want Georgia to be in the European Union, and I am sure it will be,” Zelensky added later. “We want Moldova to be in the European Union, and I am sure it will be. All free peoples of Europe deserve this.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Laura Richardson speaks during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, March 8.House Armed Services CommitteeCNN      Senior US generals issued stark warnings to lawmakers about what they described as an “aggressive” expansion of Chinese influence in South America and the Caribbean encroaching on American interests in the region.  “The [People’s Republic of China] has the capability and intent to eschew international norms, advance its brand of authoritarianism, and amass power and influence at the expense of these democracies,” Gen. Laura Richardson, commander of US Southern Command, said on Wednesday. “The PRC has expanded its ability to extract resources, establish port, manipulate governments through predatory investment practices, and build potential dual-use space facilities — the most space facilities in any combatant command region.”   Indeed, Richardson and Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of US Northern Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that China’s expansion has included increased work on the Belt and Road Initiative, a massive international infrastructure project that seeks to expand Chinese influence around the world, as well as “economic coercion” in the Bahamas and “investment” on South American projects.  “We’ve got to pay more attention to this region,” Richardson said. “The proximity matters. They are on the 20-yard line of our homeland. We are in a neighborhood, these are our neighbors, and we have got to pay attention to them.”  American officials have voiced similar concerns about Chinese activities in other regions of the world including Africa as Beijing looks to compete with Washington not just militarily but also economically and in terms of soft power.

W DIA Director General Paul Nakasone National Security Agency NSATom Williams/CQ Roll Call/APUS intel chiefs say China likely to press Taiwan and seek to undercut USIn the Caribbean, China is “very aggressive” in the Bahamas, VanHerck said, where they have built the largest embassy in the world complete with an ambassador who “uses the information space to undermine us each and every day.”   He added that the US has not had a permanent ambassador to the Bahamas since 2011, and appointing one would “vastly help.”  VanHerck also noted that there is “significant” investment from China in Mexico, and that 80% of Mexico’s telecommunications is provided by Chinese companies.  Richardson added that while the US also has a “lot of investment” in South America, the US does not advertise it enough. And while many of those countries will seek contracts for big projects, she said, they only see “PRC and Chinese bidders,” which makes them feel they’ve “got no choice” but to work with China.  At the same time, however, Richardson said China’s investments do not actually benefit countries in the region and claimed Beijing is “taking advantage” of South American nations by pushing them into a “debt trap associated with the multiple loans” they provide.  The reflection of pedestrians is seen in a billboard advertising Chinese video app TikTok at Wangfujing street on August 20, 2020 in Beijing, China. VCG/Getty ImagesTikTok could be a valuable tool for China if it invades Taiwan, FBI director says“They don’t invest in the country, the extract … they bring their own workers, Chinese laborers, to the country and build these high-rise apartments. So the investing, you don’t see the investment in the country,” she said.  The hearing comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China, following the shootdown of a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina last month, and reports that China is considering assisting Russia in its war against Ukraine.  Chinese officials have denied claims that they are considering providing lethal military aid to Russia, but US officials have maintained that China would face “real costs” if they went forward with the support.  China has also denied that the balloon shot down off the US coast into the Atlantic Ocean was a surveillance balloon. But on Wednesday, VanHerck said the event displayed “one of the ways our competitors target us each and every day.”   “Candidly, the internal discord of this event just showed one of the ways our competitors target us each and every day in the information space,” VanHerck said, “and they’re becoming increasingly adept at driving wedges between the American people.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Russia says it may challenge Biden’s nominee to head the World Bank    			By Reuters  Published  6:17 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackWorld Bank president: We're facing a global recession in 2023    05:42   - Source:CNNRussia is consulting with its allies about challenging the US nominee to head the World Bank, Moscow’s top representative at the organization said Tuesday. The move could complicate what was expected to be a smooth succession process.  Russia remains a voting member of the World Bank, although the bank halted all programs in Russia and Belarus last March, citing what it called “hostilities against the people of Ukraine” following Russia’s invasion.  Roman Marshavin, the World Bank executive director who represents Russia and Syria, told Reuters the “listing of potential candidates and consultations are still ongoing,” but gave no details. He said the decision would be made in Moscow.  US President Joe Biden last month nominated ex-Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, 63, to replace David Malpass at the helm of the World Bank, which oversees billions of dollars in funding for developing countries.  Russia’s plans were first reported by Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency.  It quoted Marshavin as saying he was in discussions with other countries about possible candidates including Russian financiers and foreign economists, former heads of international organizations, as well as several ex-ministers of finance and heads of central banks.  Marshavin declined to comment on the specifics of the TASS report or which other countries were involved.TensionsBanga, who is traveling in Africa this week, said last week that he had already won support from India, Ghana and Kenya. He also received positive reviews from France and Germany at last month’s meeting of Group of 20 finance officials, and on Tuesday won the endorsement of Bangladesh.  The US Treasury declined to comment on the possible Russian challenge.  While the bank will accept nominations from other countries until March 29, Biden’s nomination all but assures that Banga will fill the role.  The World Bank has been headed by someone from the United States, the lender’s dominant shareholder, since its founding at the end of World War Two.  A challenge from Russia or an allied country is unlikely to change the outcome, given the shareholding structure, but it could expose simmering tensions between the United States and Western nations and China — the World Bank’s third-largest shareholder — over the bank and other global financial institutions.

FloodsAs many parts of California attempt to recover from colossal amounts of snow that trapped mountain communities, more than 16 million people are now under flood watches ahead of a storm set to drench the state Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain. The places that will be impacted – mostly across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento – have already been dealt layers of snow from the previous brutal storms. In response to the ominous forecast, many residents in the region have been urged to prepare at least two weeks of essentials ahead of the likely flooding. The impending atmospheric river event won’t be the first this year to lash California. Late last year and into the new year, multiple rounds of heavy rains from atmospheric rivers soaked entire neighborhoods and unleashed mudslides that killed at least 18 people.2. Mexico kidnappingTwo of the four Americans who authorities say were kidnapped in Mexico last week have been found dead, officials said Tuesday. The other two were found alive. The group of friends traveled from South Carolina so one of them – a mother of six – could undergo a medical procedure across the border, but they never made it to the appointment. The discovery of the Americans’ whereabouts comes days after the four were targeted by a Mexican cartel that likely mistook them for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official said. Their abduction highlights the ongoing violence that has plagued some Mexican cities during the long-running Mexican drug war as well as the growing business of “medical tourism.”3. Covid-19The US is planning to relax Covid-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, a source told CNN. In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijing’s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases. Those restrictions will be relaxed this week, the source said, citing a decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths – and more data surrounding the variants that were circulating in China. The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a program that surveys travelers on details around new variants. 4. MarijuanaVoters in Oklahoma will reject a ballot measure that would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state for adults ages 21 and older, CNN projects. The measure in Tuesday’s special election would have allowed for possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the growth of up to six marijuana plants. If it had passed, there would also have been a 15% tax on sales of recreational marijuana in the state. Supporters of the measure argued it would bring in new tax revenue, but critics said it would negatively impact communities. It was one of several ballot measures on cannabis use that has been considered by voters in recent months. Similar measures in November failed in Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota, while voters in Maryland and Missouri passed measures for recreational cannabis use.5. TikTokA dozen senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Tuesday expanding President Joe Biden’s legal authority to ban TikTok nationwide, marking the latest in a string of congressional proposals threatening the social media platform’s future in the country. The legislation specifically aims to give the government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk. The proposed law takes a wide-ranging approach to fears that companies with ties to China could be pressured by that country’s government into handing over Americans’ data. The legislation has “sparked a lot of interest” from other senators beyond the 12 co-sponsors and among some members of the House in both parties, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said.BREAKFAST BROWSEWhat to know about Holi, the festival of colors  Millions of people in India and around the world are celebrating Holi this week.

Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu pose to the media during a rally on May 21, 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey.

Sign up here.Abu Dhabi, UAECNN      Turkey’s opposition on Monday announced Kemal Kilicdaroglu as the presidential candidate to run against two-decade ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an upcoming election that could change the course of the country.   Leader of Turkey’s secular and center-left Republican People’s Party (CHP), Kilicdaroglu (pronounced Ke-lich-dar-ou-loo) is widely seen as everything Erdogan is not. He was finally nominated after three days of political bickering among the six-party alliance – just three months before the vote.    His much-awaited selection also came after strong criticism of the opposition bloc for their delay in choosing their frontrunner, which analysts said may have bolstered Erdogan’s chances.   Perhaps the most important election in Turkey’s modern history, the vote is expected to take place on May 14.    It comes just months after a deadly February 6 earthquake rocked the country’s southeast, killing more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria. It also falls amid soaring inflation and a currency crisis that last year saw nearly 30% slashed off the lira’s value against the dollar.    Erdogan, who turned 69 last month, is hoping to extend his power well into a third decade. And while the AK Party leader is today facing the fiercest opposition yet to his rule, polls suggest a very tight race between him and the CHP candidate even after last month’s earthquake caused widespread disgruntlement in his strongholds.    But who is the slightly older, bespectacled contender hoping to break Erdogan’s 20-year grip on power?  A follower of Ataturk  A lawmaker representing the CHP since 2002 – the same year that saw Erdogan’s AK Party rise to power – Kilicdaroglu, 74, climbed up the political ladder to become his party’s seventh chairman in 2010.    Born in the eastern, Kurdish-majority province of Tunceli, the party leader ran in Turkey’s 2011 general election but lost, coming second to Erdogan and his AK Party.     Kilicdaroglu represents the party formed 100 years ago by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founding father of modern Turkey and a die-hard secularist. He stands in stark contrast to Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted party and its conservative base.    Despite his secular leanings, however, the opposition candidate and his alliance have vowed to represent all factions of Turkish society, which analysts say was demonstrated in his diverse coalition.

Burak Kara/Getty ImagesTurkey's earthquake caused $34 billion in damage. It could cost Erdogan the electionThe opposition bloc’s roadmap has been clear in its aim to reverse Erdogan’s presidential system, moving towards a more inclusive parliamentary system where the president’s role holds less power.    “There will no longer be a centralization of power at the hands of the president,” said Mehmet Karli, coordinator of the Program on Contemporary Turkey at the European Studies Centre at Oxford University.   “The presidency will become a symbolic office and Turkey will revert back to the parliamentary democracy that it was since 1921,” Karli, who is also a long-term adviser to Kilicdaroglu, told CNN.    Kilicdaroglu stands for a more “pluralist Turkish identity,” said Karli, where freedoms and liberties are cherished.  Erdogan’s polar opposite Sometimes referred to as “Ghandhi Kemal” for both his physical resemblance to India’s Mahatma Ghandhi as well as his humble decorum, Kilicdaroglu is seen as Erdogan’s polar opposite, analysts say.    “Kemal Kilicdaroglu is everything President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not,” Gonul Tol, founding director of the Middle East Institute’s Turkey program in Washington, DC, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Tuesday. “Erdogan is a rightwing, populist firebrand who has dismantled the country’s institutions to establish his one-man rule.”   “He has little regard for expertise or liberal democratic values,” she said, adding that while Kilicdaroglu is not as charismatic, “he wants to rebuild the country’s institutions, diffuse power and rule with consultations and compromise.”    While both Kilicdaroglu and Erdogan hail from humble socio-economic backgrounds, “they evolved to be completely different creatures,” says Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul.    Symbolically, “Erdogan is the shopkeeper, Kilicdaroglu is the bureaucrat,” said Somer, referring to Erdogan’s businessman-like approach, as opposed to that of Kilicdaroglu, who Somer says is more committed to procedure.     “Kilicdaroglu will try to fight corruption and also bring past corruptions to justice,” he said.  An ‘institutional’ foreign policy Kilicdaroglu is expected to have a softer and more predictable approach toward the West, analysts say, as he will not be acting unilaterally but through institutions.    “Kilicdaroglu is a strong believer that Turkey belongs in the West,” said Karli, his adviser.   If the West wants a relationship with Turkey that is based on “shared values,” says Somer, then they are very likely to experience a much better partnership under Kilicdaroglu, whose values, he said, are much closer to those of the West and the European Union.    Conflicts with foreign powers are still bound to take place, he continued, as Turkey has its own national interests which Kilicdaroglu and the opposition are also keen to preserve.

Erdogan’s foreign policy has often been described as “combative” and “personal,” which the opposition may change to become more institutional, predictable and based on soft power, Somer said.   Turkey’s friendship with Russia may also witness change, experts say. A close friend of Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been clear to support his Turkish counterpart.    Karli says that Kilicdaroglu will call out Russia for its violation of international law, referring to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while maintaining a balancing role between Moscow and Turkey’s Western allies.    In the Middle East, where Erdogan has for months been pledging a new incursion into northern Syria amid his fight with Kurdish militants, Kilicdaroglu’s approach is expected to be much less interventionist, experts say.    Kilicdaroglu is a follower of Ataturk’s maxim, says Karli, that “unless a nation’s life faces peril, war is murder.” What are his chances of winning? This year’s election presents an unprecedented scenario where one candidate, Erdogan, is running against a coalition of parties that haven’t traditionally seen eye-to-eye on ideology, analysts say.   Somer, of Koc University, sees Kilicdaroglu’s approach to running in a coalition as a potential strength.    Kilicdaroglu and the two vice presidents he has named are the three most popular leaders in the country, said Tol. “If they run as a team, this will certainly broaden the appeal of the opposition coalition,” she said.

And while many critics expected the earthquake to impact Erdogan’s reelection chances, polls indicate that the government is not likely to lose as many votes as the opposition anticipated, Ozer Sencar, chairman of MetroPOLL, a Turkish polling firm, told CNN.    “After the earthquake, Erdogan’s popularity decreased by only 1 point, while Kilicdaroglu’s popularity decreased by 5 points,” he said.    “All these data show that the losses of the government and Erdogan due to the earthquake are at a level that can be compensated.”   The race is going to be a tight one, said Somer.    “It will be a referendum between democracy and autocracy, not an election between two candidates,” he said. “It will be an epic story.”    The digest Iraq enforces seven-year-old ban on alcohol sale  Iraq has begun enforcing a 2016 ban on alcoholic beverages, Reuters reported, citing the country’s official gazette – a move some Iraqis attribute to the growing clout of Islamic religious parties that they fear is threatening social freedoms. Enforcement took effect seven years after the law’s passage by parliament.    Background: Under the law, imported alcoholic beverages are prohibited and cannot be sold in local markets, or replaced by domestically manufactured versions. Border crossings and airport authorities have been ordered to confiscate any alcoholic drinks in the possession of travelers. Licenses to sell alcohol have only been issued to non-Muslims in Iraq and, while drinking in public is not prohibited, it is frowned upon. In the capital Baghdad, it is not unusual to see youths drinking on the banks of the Tigris River. Why it matters: Analysts say religious parties exert more influence in the current coalition government than recent predecessors. Iraq is a conservative, mainly Muslim society where most men and women eschew alcohol, but it is not an Islamic state, critics of the alcohol ban say. Still, Iraq’s stance on alcohol has long been seen as relatively liberal in the Islamic world compared with neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, where possession of alcohol is outlawed. At least 6 Palestinians killed in Israeli raid targeting killer of settler brothers At least six Palestinians were killed in an Israeli military raid into the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. The target of the raid was Abdul-Fattah Hussein Kharousha, the Israel Defense Forces said, calling him a “Hamas terrorist operative” and saying he was suspected of shooting two settler brothers in the Palestinian town of Huwara last week. Hamas later on Tuesday claimed Kharousha, 49, as a member, and said he had killed two Israeli settlers in Huwara.   Background: Brothers Hillel Yaniv, 21 and Yagel Yaniv, 19, were shot as they drove through the Palestinian village of Huwara in the occupied West Bank on February 26. They lived in the nearby Israeli settlement of Har Bracha. Their killing prompted settler mobs to rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara last week, killing one Palestinian. Why it matters: The raid is at least the third to take place in daylight this year. The previous two – one in Jenin and one in Nablus – each resulted in 11 Palestinian fatalities, including militants being targeted by Israel, people clashing with the Israeli forces, and bystanders.  Saudi foreign minister says Syria may return to Arab League Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud said on Tuesday that it is “too early to tell” if Syrian President Bashar Assad would be invited to the Arab League summit in Riyadh, but that engagement with Damascus is necessary “and that may well lead eventually to Syria returning” to the grouping. “There is consensus building in the Arab World that the status quo is not working,” Al-Saud told journalists at a press briefing at the Saudi embassy in London on Tuesday.     Background: Syria was largely isolated from the rest of the Arab world following Assad’s deadly crackdown against protests that erupted against his rule in 2011. The Arab League suspended Syria’s membership in 2011 and many Arab countries pulled their envoys out of Damascus. Algeria hosted the first Arab League summit since before the Covid-19 pandemic in November, though Damascus stayed away after Algeria failed to persuade other Arab states to end Syria’s suspension. Why it matters: Assad has benefited from an outpouring of support from Arab states following the devastating earthquake on Feb. 6, which killed thousands of Syrians. Saudi Arabia will host this year’s Arab League summit. Around the region Nusaiba Al Maskari in MuscatEman AliIn her sunlit portrait of the pole dancing instructor Nusaiba Al Maskari, the UK-born Omani photographer Eman Ali creates an arresting visual simile between the strength of Al Maskari’s body and the Hajar Mountains in the background. Gracefully extending herself horizontally from her pole, she aligns with the peaks above Muscat, a single fluid line across the picture plane.   Ali, who currently works between Oman and Bahrain, began practicing pole dancing herself while living in London years ago. She wanted to meet and photograph Al Maskari in particular after hearing about the instructor’s private studio, Rock & Rhythm, she explained over email.   “I am drawn to like-minded women who aren’t afraid to be themselves,” Ali said.   Though pole dancing has become a popular form of fitness around the world over the past two decades, having such a studio in the Gulf country is “highly unusual,” Ali explained.   “I admire her bravery in bringing a sport that celebrates female sensuality to a more conservative environment and am inspired by how she helps women feel confident and empowered by their body.”   The striking portrait is part of Ali’s meditative series about life in Oman, “The Earth Would Die if the Sun Stopped Kissing Her,” part of a global project from the NFT platform Obscura in which nearly 140 photographers documented contemporary life during the same month.   Ali’s contribution, which she also exhibited at the international fair Paris Photo last fall, is a love letter to Oman’s land and people, “highlighting the beauty, imperfections and strength” that bind us, she explained.

The dismissal by a senior Ukrainian official on Tuesday came in response to a report by the New York Times, which cited new intelligence that had been reviewed by United States officials.   “Although I enjoy collecting amusing conspiracy theories about (the Ukrainian) government, I have to say: (Ukraine) has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea mishap and has no information about ‘pro-(Ukraine) sabotage groups,’” Mykhailo Podolyak, top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote on Twitter.  The New York Times said the new intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a group loyal to Ukraine but acting independently of the government in Kyiv were involved in the operation.  Mystery has surrounded who might be responsible for the brazen sabotage last September which damaged two pipes transporting Russian gas into the European Union and targeted a crucial source of revenue for Moscow. Both pipelines were closed at the time of the attack, which came months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  A source familiar with the US intelligence told CNN the assessment was not made with high confidence and is not the predominant view of the intelligence community, and that the US has not yet identified a culprit for the attack.  There is a section of the US intelligence community that believes that pro-Ukrainian actors would have had the motive to sabotage the pipelines because of how Russia was weaponizing them against Ukraine and Europe.   The intelligence community has no evidence, however, that Ukrainian leaders, including Zelensky, had any knowledge of or involvement in the pipeline sabotage, the source said.  German defense minister Boris Pistorius on Wednesday warned of drawing conclusions too hastily following the report. In an interview with public radio station Deutschlandfunk (DLF), he added that the chance of a false flag operation was within the realm of possibilities.  “It could just as well be, and this has also been made clear in the reports, that it was a false flag action (operation), in other words, to blame pro-Ukrainian groups and make it look that way, the probability of one or the other is equally high, so we must now wait and see how things develop,” he told DLF.  “It does not help us to think about the impact this would have on our support for Ukraine on the basis of such research, which has undoubtedly been done painstakingly and meticulously.”  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said no perpetrator had yet been identified. “We have not been able to determine who was behind [the sabotage],” he said, adding, “There are ongoing national investigations and I think it’s right to wait until those are finalized before we say anything more.”   Gas bubbles from the Nord Stream 2 leak reach the surface of the Baltic Sea near Bornholm, Denmark on September 27, 2022.Danish Defence Command/Reuters/FILE    New twist in energy standoffThe incident, in which underwater explosions occurred before the pipelines burst in several places, remains a major point of contention between Russia and the West.  The pipelines which link Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea to funnel gas from Russia into the European Union were controversial long before the Kremlin waged war on Ukraine, largely because of fears around European reliance on Russian energy.   Their damage became yet another twist in the energy standoff that erupted after the invasion as Europe sought to wean itself from Russian fuel.  Russia, which has in the past publicly denied it was involved in striking the pipelines and blamed the West for the explosions, also pushed back on the latest assessment surfacing in the media.  A Kremlin spokesman described the report as “obvious misinformation campaign coordinated by the media.”   “Clearly, the authors of the attack want to divert attention. This is an obvious misinformation campaign coordinated by the media,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media RIA Novosti on Wednesday.  Multiple investigations by European authorities are on-going.   Swedish prosecutors in November confirmed the blasts at the pipelines were an act of sabotage after investigators uncovered evidence of explosives at the sites, but their preliminary investigation had yet to determine any charges.   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby referred questions to investigating Europeans authorities and said he was “not going to get ahead of that investigative work.”  “Several our European partners – in fact, three of them in Germany, Sweden and Denmark – have already opened investigations into what happened with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and those investigations are not closed. They’re still hard at work on that,” Kirby said.  The German prosecutors’ office told CNN Wednesday they searched a boat in January that was suspected of carrying explosives used in the Nordstream 1 and 2 explosions. It said investigations were ongoing, and reliable statements cannot be issued yet, particularly as to whether there was any state involvement.  In the days following the incident, sightings of Russian vessels operating in the area where the leaks occured raised suspicions about the potential involvement of Russia, which at that time drew attention from both European and US officials as the only actor in the region believed to have both the capability and motivation to deliberately damage the pipelines.   So far, no evidence has been presented to the public as to which parties are responsible.   During a meeting of G20 Foreign Ministers in New Delhi earlier this month, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted on the necessity of a “fair and prompt investigation” into the explosions.

IMF chief: Ukraine war will have ‘devastating’ consequences for Russia’s economy    			By Julia Horowitz, CNN		  Updated  7:27 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad Feedback'We don't see global recession': IMF chief on 2023 economic outlook    02:12   - Source:CNN Business    LondonCNN      The International Monetary Fund has drawn criticism for forecasting that Russia will see stronger economic growth this year than either the United Kingdom or Germany, despite rising pressure from Western sanctions.   But Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that the economic outlook for Russia beyond 2023 is “quite devastating.”  “When you take our projections over a medium term, what they mean is Russia[’s economy] shrinking by at least 7%,” Georgieva said in an interview that aired Wednesday.   In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from both the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Economists at those groups have penciled in contractions of 3.3% and 5.6% in 2023, respectively.  Even Russia’s own central bank, which extended emergency capital controls for another six months on Monday, has said gross domestic product might contract by 1% this year.  A man walks past commercial premises put up for rent and sale in Moscow on February 10, 2023. - Real estate analysts say the housing market in Russia has been on a rollercoaster ride since Russians panicked when sanctions over the country's military action in Ukraine hit and then adjusted to their new reality. First, prices spiked as home-owners sought to secure their savings when the penalties hit. Then they dropped as tens of thousands Russians opposed to the conflict and worried for their futures up and left. President Putin insists Russia is weathering the Western sanctions. A home-grown brand has replaced McDonald's and supermarkets are offering Russian-made drinks to replace foreign brands like Coca Cola, which left Russia last year. Still, Russia's economy is facing mounting problems as the West -- one year into the conflict -- is building on its sanctions program with a 10th EU package looming. Hundreds of foreign companies have exited, leaving behind emptying shopping malls, while inflation, which stands at around 12 percent, has undermined the purchasing power of Russian wages. Natalia Koleniskova/AFP/Getty ImagesRussia's economy is hurting despite Putin's blusterJeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor, wrote in Fortune magazine Monday that the “IMF has been asleep at the switch” and parroting propaganda from Russian President Vladimir Putin.  “With respect to Russia, it is naively echoing Putin’s own invented GDP forecasts, in effect, canonizing and legitimating these economic myths with no verification,” said Sonnenfeld and two colleagues, Stephen Roach and Steven Tian.  Sonnenfeld has kept a list of Western companies curtailing operations in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine one year ago and has called for firms to exit the country.  Georgieva told CNN that Russia’s economy would suffer over time as workers emigrated and access to technology was cut off, and as sanctions on its vast energy industry took a toll.  “This year what we reflect on is that Russia has managed to direct some of [its] oil sales beyond the markets of the European Union,” she said, referring to Russia’s success in rerouting crude shipments to China and India. “That is not going to be a lasting impact for the Russian economy.”   “We don’t see Russia in any way benefiting from what they have caused to Ukraine and to themselves.”  Following Europe’s recent import bans on seaborne Russian crude and oil products, Moscow’s finances have shown signs of strain. On Monday, the Russian government reported a budget deficit of 2.58 trillion rubles ($34 billion) for January and February, compared with a surplus of 415 billion ($5.5 billion) rubles in the same period in 2022. It said oil and gas revenues had fallen 46% year-over-year.Inflation fight continuesMeanwhile, the US and European economies have proven surprisingly resilient, Georgieva said. She pointed to the strength of their job markets and Europe’s swift action to limit reliance on Russian energy.  “All of this contributes positively to our prospects for growth,” Georgieva said. “We don’t see [a] global recession in the cards for this year.”  That won’t prevent a global slowdown, however, as central banks continue their campaigns to bring inflation down from the highest levels in decades. The IMF expects world economic output, which grew 3.4% in 2022, to rise 2.9% in 2023.  Yet according to Georgieva, it’s essential policymakers don’t ease up on interest rate hikes prematurely, lest prices soar again.  “Stay the course,” Georgieva advised Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.   The Fed slowed the pace of rate hikes last month, but Powell indicated in testimony to Congress Tuesday that the central bank may need to turn hawkish again.  “The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell said. The Fed “would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes” if necessary, he added.  — Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.

Chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., makes an opening statement during the Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats in Hart Building on Wednesday, March 8, 2023. From left are, FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Gen. Paul Nakasone, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, CIA Director William J.Burns, and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott D.Berrier. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/APCNN      US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to press Taiwan and try to undercut US influence in the coming years as he begins a third term as president.  While Beijing has stepped up its public criticism of the US, Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the intelligence community assesses that China still believes it “benefits most by preventing a spiraling of tensions and by preserving stability in its relationship with the United States.”  Haines and the other top intelligence officials – CIA Director William Burns, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier and NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone – testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday at the panel’s annual public worldwide threats hearing.  Haines ticked through the global challenges the US faces – from China and Russia to Iran and North Korea – along with the risks related to cyber and technology as well as authoritarian governments.   China was among the top concerns for senators at the hearing, where Haines and the other intelligence chiefs were pressed on everything from China’s global ambitions to the risks of TikTok and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China.  Russia’s war in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s long-term intentions were another key issue, as Haines warned that Putin could be digging in for the long haul because the Russian military cannot make territorial gains.Russia probably does not want conflict with US and NATO, intel chiefs sayThe US intelligence community believes that Russia “probably does not want a direct military conflict with US and NATO forces, but there is potential for that to occur,” according to the unclassified annual threat assessment report of the intelligence community issued on Wednesday that US intelligence leaders testified about.   “Russian leaders thus far have avoided taking actions that would broaden the Ukraine conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders, but the risk for escalation remains significant,” the report says.   Haines said in her testimony that the Ukraine conflict has become a “grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage,” but said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to carry on, possibly for years.  “We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favor, and that prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia’s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,” Haines said.  Haines explained that Russia will likely be unable to sustain even its currently modest level of offensive operations in Ukraine without an additional mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources.  “They may fully shift to holding and defending the territories they now occupy,” said Haines  Haines called Putin’s “nuclear saber-rattling” an attempt to “deter the West from providing additional support to Ukraine.”  “He probably will still remain confident that Russia can eventually militarily defeat Ukraine and wants to prevent Western support from tipping the balance and forcing a conflict with NATO,” she said.  Still, as Russia deals with “extensive damage” from its war in Ukraine, Moscow will grow more dependent on its nuclear, cyber and space capabilities, the US intelligence agencies said in their report.  Heavy losses on the battlefield in Ukraine “have degraded Moscow’s ground- and air-based conventional capabilities and increased its reliance on nuclear weapons,” the report added.Senators concerned about China and Tik-Tok, Covid origins investigationSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence panel, argued that TikTok presents “a substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didn’t face in the past.”  The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, Wray told the panel Wednesday.   Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Rubio on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait.  “The most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something that’s very sacred in our country — the difference between the private sector and public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,” Wray said.  Rubio and Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, also pressed the intelligence leaders on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in light of a new Energy Department assessment, made with low confidence, that the pandemic likely was the result of a lab leak in Wuhan.   Haines said the intelligence community is still seeking to collect additional information to determine the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic but reiterated there’s no consensus at this point among US intelligence agencies.  “There’s a broad consensus in the intelligence community that the outbreak is not the result of a bioweapon or genetic engineering. What there isn’t a consensus on is whether or not it’s a lab leak, essentially as Director Wray indicated, or natural exposure to an infected animal,” Haines said.  Collins, a proponent of the lab leak theory, argued that the two theories should not carry the same weight.  “I just don’t understand why you continue to maintain on behalf of the intelligence community that these are two equally plausible explanations. They simply are not,” Collins said.Committee has ‘unfinished business’ on classified documentsSenate Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said that the committee still had “unfinished business” with the investigation into the handling of classified documents, reiterating that the committee still needed to see the documents taken from the offices and homes of President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.   “I think I speak for everyone on both sides of the aisle on this committee, we still have unfinished business regarding the classified documents that we need to see in order for this intelligence committee to effectively oversee its job on intelligence oversights,” said Warner during his opening remarks at the committee’s annual worldwide threats hearing.  Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, asked Haines and Wray why they hadn’t personally looked at all of the classified documents that were found. They responded they had both reviewed some but not all of the documents.   Wray said that he had gone through a “fairly meticulous listing” of all the documents with “detailed information about the contents,” while noting the FBI had teams experienced with mishandling of classified documents cases.   At the end of Wednesday’s public hearing, both Warner and Rubio pressed the intelligence chiefs to give the committee access to the classified documents so they could conduct proper oversight of the intelligence community’s damage assessment on the mishandling of the classified material.  “How can we possibly conduct oversight over whether you’ve assigned the proper risk assessment and over whether the mitigation is appropriate – how can we possibly do that if we don’t know what we’re talking about?” Rubio said. “A special counsel cannot have veto authority over Congress’ ability to do its job. It just can’t happen. It won’t happen. And so it will change the nature of the relationship between this committee.”Intel community says racially motivated extremists are most lethal threatTransnational racially and ethnically motivated extremists, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists,”remain the most lethal threat to US persons and interests,” the intelligence community said in its new report.  The report says this largely “decentralized movement” poses “a significant threat to a number of US allies and partners through attacks and propaganda that espouses violence.”  “These actors increasingly seek to sow social divisions, support fascist-style governments, and attack government institutions. The transnational and loose structure of RMVE organizations challenges local security services and creates a resilience against disruptions,” the report states, referring to racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist groups.   The report also raises concern that a prolonged conflict in Ukraine could provide foreign racially and ethnically motivated extremists “with opportunities to gain access to battlefield experience and weapons.”  Cotton questioned Haines skeptically about the assessment, arguing that deaths from fentanyl were more lethal in the US. Haines responded that while fentanyl caused more deaths, the report was in relation to terrorism threats.   “But in the context of terrorism, your conclusion is that racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists are a more lethal threat to Americans than ISIS or Al Qaeda or Hezbollah?” Cotton asked.  Haines noted that past reports had made the same assessment, as racially and ethnically motivated extremists were similarly listed as the most lethal threat to US persons and interests in the 2022 version of the intelligence community report.  “It simply is a question of how many people, how many US persons are killed or wounded as a consequence of attacks,” Haines said.  “I find this astonishing,” Cotton said at the end of his questioning.  This story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.

Russian film makers on Tuesday released a trailer for “The Challenge,” which became the first ever feature film to be shot in space in 2021.  The trailer outlines the movie’s plot: A surgeon, Zhenya, played by Russian actress Yulia Peresild, has to perform heart surgery on a sick cosmonaut in space because he is unable to return to Earth for treatment. The patient is portrayed by real-life cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy.

Peresild and producer-director Klim Shipenko traveled to the International Space Station (ISS) – 250 miles above earth – alongside veteran Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov in October 2021 and filmed the movie over the course of 12 days.   Peresild was selected to star in the movie after Roscomos posted an open casting call in November 2020. In addition to providing an audition tape, prospective stars had to undergo medical, psychological and physical tests to ensure they could cope with the demands of space travel.    jsc2021e043285 (Aug. 26, 2021) --- Soyuz MS-19 crew members (from left) Yulia Peresild, Anton Shkaplerov and Klim Shipenko pose for a portrait at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia.

Although “The Challenge” is the first feature-length film to be shot in space, it’s not the first project to be filmed aboard the ISS. Previous films include a 2002 IMAX documentary narrated by Tom Cruise and a 2012 eight-minute science fiction film by entrepreneur and space tourist Richard Garriott.

The court session was broadcast live on the legislature’s website.  “76 votes for, 13 against. The bill was adopted in the first reading,” said Speaker of the Parliament Shalva Papuashvili.   The bill must pass further readings in parliament to become law, but so far appears to have broad support among Georgian lawmakers despite criticism domestically and abroad.  Thousands of protesters could be seen outside the parliament building on Tuesday night, holding not just the Georgian flag but also European Union flags.   Some threw stones and petrol bombs, as security forces responded with tear gas and water cannon. Video posted on social media also showed protesters storming a barricade at the entrance to the parliament building and tearing it down.  A woman affected by tear gas receives medical aid during a rally against the ""foreign agents"" law in Tbilisi, Georgia, March 7.Zurab Javakhadze/ReutersThere are fears the law could impede the country’s hopes of closer ties with the European Union.   The President of Georgia, Salome Zourabichvili, threw her support behind protesters, in a video message posted on Facebook, saying “the path of European integration must be protected. Those who support this law today, all those who voted for this law today are violating the Constitution. All of them are alienating us from Europe,” she said.  She said she would repeal the law if it crossed her desk. However, the ruling Dream Party has the parliamentary majority to overcome a presidential veto, according to Human Rights Watch.   “I said on day one that I would veto this law, and I will do that,”  Zourabichvili said in the video.  Protesters gather in front of police officers, who block the way during a rally against the ""foreign agents"" law in Tbilisi, Georgia, March 7, 2023.Zurab Javakhadze/ReutersGeorgia’s Interior Ministry asked protesters to disperse, warning that “legal measures” would be taken to restore calm. A total of 66 people were detained and charged with offenses ranging from petty hooliganism and disobedience to police, the country’s public broadcaster First Channel reported Wednesday.    The ministry said the protest went beyond the framework of a peaceful assembly and turned into violence, according to First Channel. The protesters tried to block the parliament building’s entrances, threw stones, smashed glasses, and damaged iron fences, according to First Channel.   Police were forced to use proportional force to restore public order, the ministry said, according to Fist Channel.   Protesters’ chants, with insults aimed at both Georgian politicians and Russian President Vladimir Putin, underline fears that the bill follows the model of a controversial law in neighboring Russia that has already imposed draconian restrictions and requirements on organizations and individuals with foreign ties.  President Zourabichvili called it “an unnecessary law that did not come out of nowhere, but was dictated by Moscow,” telling protesters that she was “standing next to you because you are the very people who represent free Georgia today. The Georgia which sees its future in Europe and will not let anyone take this future away from it.”  The Georgian bill has been widely criticized as posing a potential chilling effect for Georgian civil society, and particularly NGOs and news organizations with links to Europe.   Video Ad FeedbackPoliticians in this country next to Russia want to pass controversial law. A fight broke out in parliament    01:00   - Source:CNN Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have said that the bill would impede rights to freedom of expression and association in the country with onerous financial reporting requirements.  “The ‘foreign agent’ bills seek to marginalize and discredit independent, foreign-funded groups and media that serve the wider public interest in Georgia,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch.  An EU statement Tuesday warned that the law would be “incompatible with EU values and standards” and could have “serious repercussions on our relations.”  In February, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price also said that “anyone voting for this draft legislation” could also imperil Georgia’s relationship with Europe and the West.   The former Soviet republic has played a balancing act between its citizens’ pro-European sentiment and its regional positioning next to Russia. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in 2011 that had Russia not invaded Georgia in 2008, NATO would have expanded into Georgia.   The invasion only lasted a couple days, but it appeared to have the same pretext Russian President Vladimir Putin used to invade Ukraine in 2014 and last year, writes think tank European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).“In the last few years, and especially over the past 18 months, Georgia’s ruling coalition has made a series of moves that seem designed to distance the country from the West and shift it gradually into Russia’s sphere of influence,” ECFR writes in a report where it attributes much of the drift to the ruling Georgian Dream party.

Qin, who was until recently China’s ambassador to the US, built up a reputation for being careful and accomplished diplomat while overseas.  But he struck a far more combative tone in his first appearance as foreign minister at China’s annual parliamentary meeting, warning of the “catastrophic consequences” of what he described as a “reckless gamble” by Washington in how it treats its fellow superpower.  “If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” Qin said on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress in Beijing.  At the highly scripted event, Qin set the tone for China’s foreign policy for the coming year and beyond, berating the US for rising bilateral tensions and defending Beijing’s close partnership with Moscow.  Ties between the world’s two largest economies are at their worst in decades, and tensions soared further last month after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated over North America and was then shot down by US fighter jets.  On Tuesday, Qin accused the US of overreacting in its response, which he said created “a diplomatic crisis that could have been avoided.”  The incident, Qin said, shows “the US perception and views of China are seriously distorted. It regards China as its primary rival and the biggest geopolitical challenge.”  “The US claims it seeks to compete with China but does not seek conflict. But in reality, the so-called ‘competition’ by the US is all-round containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death,” he said.   “Containment and suppression will not make America great, and the US will not stop the rejuvenation of China,” Qin said.Colliding powers The great power rivalry between the US and China has intensified in recent years.  Under leader Xi Jinping, China has become increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive abroad, taking a more aggressive approach to exert its influence and counter the West.   And Washington has pushed back.  Under the Biden administration, the US has shored up ties with allies and partners to contain Beijing’s rising influence, including in its backyard.   It has also pushed to decouple from China in emerging technologies, recently banning the export of advanced chips to the fury of Beijing.  Qin lashed out at Washington for its Indo-Pacific strategy, accusing it of forming exclusive blocks to provoke confrontation, advocating for decoupling and plotting an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO.”  “The real purpose of the Indo-Pacific strategy is to contain China,” Qin said. “No Cold War should be repeated in Asia, and no Ukraine-style crisis should be repeated in Asia.”  China’s refusal to condemn Russia for the invasion of Ukraine and its growing partnership with Moscow have further strained its relations with the West. While Beijing has sought to cast itself as a neutral peace broker, it has also defended its “rock-solid” ties with Russia.  On Tuesday Qin said the Sino-Russian relationship “does not pose a threat to any country in the world, nor will it be interfered or sowed discord in by any third party.”  “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations,” he said.  Qin highlighted the issue of Taiwan as the “bedrock of the political foundation of Sino-US relations and the first red line that must not be crossed.”   The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and refuses to rule out the use of force to “reunify” it with mainland China.  On Tuesday, Qin urged the US not to “interfere in China’s internal affairs” and questioned Washington’s different responses to the issues of Ukraine and Taiwan.  “Why does the US talk up respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Ukraine issue, but does not respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on the issue of Taiwan? Why does the US ask China not to provide weapons to Russia while keeps selling arms to Taiwan?” Qin said.McCarthy visit?Qin’s remarks come amid reports of a potential meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April.  The Financial Times reported Monday that Tsai could meet McCarthy in California, rather than in Taiwan as the US Speaker had initially indicated.   A US State Department spokesperson said Monday he was “not aware of any confirmed travel” by the Taiwanese President, and Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it had no information to share regarding any potential US visit.  However, regardless of the location, a face to face between Tsai and a senior US politician will most certainly draw the ire of Beijing, fueling even more tensions in already tense relations across the Taiwan Strait – and between US and China.  Defying Beijing’s threats of retaliation, McCarthy’s Democratic predecessor Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August in the first trip by a US Speaker in 25 years.   Beijing responded by staging unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan and cutting off key lines of communication with the US.   China’s Foreign Ministry has since warned McCarthy not to visit Taiwan.  Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Program, said Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy in California is not necessarily a “replacement or downgrade.”   Instead, it could be an “add-on,” he said, suggesting McCarthy could always visit Taiwan at a later date.  While Taiwan wants to normalize high-level visits by American officials to Taiwan, it also needs to be seen by its Western partners that it is being a responsible stakeholder in the process.  “Some may think that there is better timing than this current moment to be pursing another US speaker visit to Taiwan,” Sung said.  A meeting in the US, he added, could serve as “a very visual deliverable in the short term to show continued US support for Taiwan, regardless of change of party leadership in the legislature.”   Tsai has transited in the US before on her visits to Taipei’s diplomatic allies.  She last visited the US in 2019 and gave a speech in New York – a trip that angered Beijing.  To China, Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy will be provocative no matter where it takes place, Sung said.  “Beijing is going to be very unhappy and protest vigorously regardless. So I guess for them it will be a difference in intensity, but not a difference in kind. Beijing won’t like any such high level exchange be it taking place on Taiwan or US soil.”    CNN’s Eric Cheung in Taipei contributed to reporting.

Winter snowBack-to-back winter storms over the past week have overwhelmed several mountain communities in California, leaving residents trapped behind walls of snow and concerned about their dwindling supplies. The Sierra Nevadas could see up to three inches of snow through today, following a weekend that brought as much as 38 inches of snow over a 24-hour period to some areas. In recent days, the snowfall prompted Yosemite National Park to close indefinitely and has buried cars under snow piles that sometimes towered as high as second-story windows. Meanwhile, the Climate Prediction Center is calling for below-average temperatures for much of the rest of the country this week which could bring snow as far south as the southern Appalachians as well as into the mid-Atlantic region.2. January 6Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired newly released footage on his show Monday from the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack that included images of the rioter known as the “QAnon Shaman,” as well as of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died following the attack. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy granted Carlson access to more than 40,000 hours of the Capitol security footage from January 6. CNN and other news organizations have also requested access to the footage. McCarthy’s office said it is still working out the process to make the footage “more widely available” but did not comment further. Separately, former Vice President Mike Pence has asked a judge to block a subpoena for his testimony related to January 6, previously arguing it was “unconstitutional and unprecedented.”  Video Ad FeedbackSource: Mike Pence asks a judge to block a subpoena for his testimony about January 6    02:17   - Source:CNN    3. ChinaGood relations between Beijing and Moscow are essential, China’s foreign minister said today, alarming some US officials. “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations,” Qin Gang said. This comes amid warnings from US officials that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia for its war against Ukraine, which Beijing has denied. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week also cautioned that arming Moscow’s forces would cause China serious problems around the world. Still, Beijing is refusing to acknowledge the nature of the conflict – it has so far avoided calling it an “invasion” – and its diplomatic and economic support for Moscow appears to be increasing.

ImmigrationThe Biden administration is considering reviving the policy of detaining migrant families who cross the border illegally. President Joe Biden had ended the practice when he came into office, but it’s now one of several options administration officials are mulling as they prepare for the end of Title 42 in May – likely resulting in a surge of crossings at the southern border. A source familiar with the deliberations said that family detentions could be limited to a small number of days – an attempt to set the policy apart from the previous administration’s handling of family detentions. Biden, however, has increasingly turned to tougher border enforcement measures in recent months, drawing criticism from immigrant advocates and progressive Democrats who view the changes as a return to some of the policies under former President Donald Trump.5. TwitterTwitter was hit Monday with one of the biggest outages to date under new owner Elon Musk. Some users who attempted to load Twitter were met with an error message or encountered slow-loading pages. In a tweet on Monday, Musk said: “This platform is so brittle (sigh). Will be fixed shortly.” Within about an hour, the issues appeared to have largely been resolved. However, the outage marked the second Twitter glitch in less than a week and the third in under a month. Analysts have noted the company has experienced a range of technical glitches since Musk took over the company and laid off more than half its staff late last year. Some former employees raised concerns that the mass layoffs under Musk could cause the platform to break in big or small ways after workers with knowledge of Twitter’s key systems were ousted.

Watch the full exclusive interview on Wednesday, March 8 at 9 p.m. ET.CNN      Russian troops will have “open road” to capture key cities in eastern Ukraine if they seize control of Bakhmut, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in an interview with CNN, as he defended his decision to keep Ukrainian forces in the besieged city.  “This is tactical for us,” Zelensky said, insisting that Kyiv’s military brass is united in prolonging its defense of the city after weeks of Russian attacks left it on the cusp of falling to Moscow’s troops.  “We understand that after Bakhmut they could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk, they could go to Sloviansk, it would be open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine, in the Donetsk direction,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an exclusive interview from Kyiv. “That’s why our guys are standing there.”  A weeks-long assault from Wagner mercenary troops, which has picked up pace in recent days, has forced thousands from the city and decimated its infrastructure. But Ukrainian troops have also mounted a dogged defense of the area, stalling Russia’s progress.  Zelensky said his motivations to keep the city are “so different” to Russia’s objectives. “We understand what Russia wants to achieve there. Russia needs at least some victory – a small victory – even by ruining everything in Bakhmut, just killing every civilian there,” Zelensky said.  He said that if Russia is able to “put their little flag” on top of Bakhmut, it would help “mobilize their society in order to create this idea they’re such a powerful army.”  Ukrainian soldiers fire a self-propelled howitzer towards Russian positions near Bakhmut, as the battle for the city itensifies.Libkos/APThough Bakhmut does not hold significant strategic value in itself, its road connections to Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – two densely populated, industrial urban hubs to the northwest – mean those cities be next in Russia’s crosshairs if they are able to take control.  Some commanders and lower level officers have questioned the merit of holding Bakhmut amid a rising number of casualties and a growing risk that hundreds or even thousands of Ukrainian troops could get cut off.  But Zelensky dismissed those concerns, saying he has “never heard anything like that” from his commanders.   “We have to think about our people first and no one should be surrounded, encircled – this is very important,” he said.   “I had a meeting with the chief of staff yesterday and the chief military commanders online and offline … and they all talk that we have to stand strong in Bakhmut,” he said. “Of course we have to think about the lives of our military. But we have to do whatever we can whilst we’re getting weapons, supplies and our army is getting ready for the counter-offensive.”  “The military sees for themselves that we have to stay strong there despite the fact that Russia ruined the whole city and everything there,” Zelensky added. “Troops were helping kids, civilians to leave the town – even up to today people were leaving Bakhmut. We were helping everyone.  Nearly 4,000 civilians – including 38 children – remain inside the battered city, the country’s Vice Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said elsewhere on Tuesday. “We have special evacuation teams, who help, and armored vehicles. But people often stay in basements, leaving no information about their whereabouts,” she said in a televised address. “This makes evacuation much more difficult.”  NATO intelligence meanwhile estimates that for every Ukrainian soldier killed defending Bakhmut, Russian forces have lost at least five, a military official with the alliance told CNN on Monday. The official cautioned the 5-to-1 ratio was an informed estimate based on intelligence.  Wagner troops have been descending on the city since capturing the town of Soledar in January. Should they gain control of Bakhmut, it would mark a rare case of a town changing hands in what has become a sluggish and slow-moving war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.  Horrific video appears to show a Ukrainian soldier, allegedly a prisoner of war, executed seemingly by Russian soldiers after he says: ""Glory to Ukraine.""From Social MediaZelensky vows justice after video appears to show Ukrainian soldier's execution An adviser within the Ukrainian Presidency, Mykhailo Podolyak, told CNN on Monday that in defending Bakhmut, Ukraine had two main goals: buying time to replenish its forces and inflicting heavy losses on Russian armies.  “It achieved its goals by 1,000%,” he said. “Even if the military leadership at some point decides to retreat to more favorable positions, the case of defending Bakhmut will be a great strategic success for the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a foundation for future victory.”  Ukraine is meanwhile racing to integrate Western weapons systems and dozens of tanks into its operations, after Zelensky successfully persuaded the US, the UK, Germany and a bloc of other European nations to step up its military aid.  It comes ahead of an anticipated Russian spring offensive that may encompass territory in central and northern Ukraine which Russia was unsuccessful in capturing in its initial invasion last year.  In recent days, a video emerged that Zelensky said showed the execution of a Ukrainian soldier by Russian forces, though Moscow has consistently denied accusations that it or its soldiers have committed war crimes.  The man, identified by Ukraine’s army on Tuesday as Tymofii Mykolayovych Shadura, says “Slava Ukraini (Glory to Ukraine),” before being executed, according to the clip.  Zelensky told CNN that the video showed “the Russian attitude towards POWs (prisoners of war). They don’t have any laws of war or international law or any conventions. It’s a question that these people – they don’t respect anything. They don’t fight like soldiers,” he said.   “For us, it’s war for our freedom, for democracy, for our values. For them it’s terrorism – that’s the attitude. And they post this video…. This is the face of this war. This is the face of the Russian Federation,” he added.CNN’s Tim Lister, Olga Voitovych and Vasco Cotovio contributed reporting.

They (China) have had in just the last three months a military or some type of confrontation with every country. And then they’re shocked that countries are taking their own steps for deterrence to protect themselves. What did they think they were going to do?” Ambassador Rahm Emanuel said in the interview at his residence in Tokyo.  The US envoy listed a string of what he said were aggressive military actions by China, including “attacks” against India along their shared Himalayan border, Chinese coast guard ships aiming lasers at Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, the firing of missiles into Japan’s exclusive economic zone and the harassment of US, Canadian and Australian aircraft by People’s Liberation Army ships and planes.  Beijing has denied being an aggressor in all those instances and accused Washington of being the primary instigator of heightened tensions in the region.  On Tuesday, China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that “conflict and confrontation” with the US is inevitable if Washington does not change course.  “The US claims it seeks to compete with China but does not seek conflict. But in reality, the so-called ‘competition’ by the US is all-round containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death,” he said during his first news conference in the new post.  “Containment and suppression will not make America great, and the US will not stop the rejuvenation of China,” Qin said.Japan and South KoreaEmanuel countered on Wednesday that military buildups and exercises by the US and its partners in the Indo-Pacific are not acts of containment, as Beijing charges, but acts of deterrence against further – and possibly more dangerous – Chinese aggression.  “They’ve come together to realize that (Chinese aggression) can’t continue as is, so every country is taking steps, both within an alliance (and) also within their own self-interest of creating a comprehensive coalition of deterrence. That’s what’s going on,” Emanuel said.  He praised Japan for doubling its defense budget and taking on a leadership role in the region, citing plans for it to operate joint South China Sea patrols with the Philippines and its agreement with South Korea just this week to settle grievances dating back to before World War II concerning Japan’s colonial rule in Korea.  And he praised both Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for putting the future before history and taking a stance that has prompted domestic backlash in both Tokyo and Seoul.  “I do think that both leaders showed a braveness and a boldness to look to the 21st century and make the most of that rather than being tied by 20th century,” Emanuel said.  “To me the test of leadership is to be idealistic enough to know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And then tough enough to get it done,” he said, adding that both Kishida and Yoon had passed that test.‘Gravitational pull of freedom’The US ambassador also contrasted the countries Japan has been partnering with, including South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, India and even the United Kingdom, with countries with whom China works, including Russia, North Korea and Iran.  “There’s a phrase in America, you’re known by the company you keep,” Emanuel said.  Over the past 18 months, the Biden administration has been keeping good company, too, he said, noting its record in uniting allies and partners.  Emanuel cited multilateral agreements like the Quad – the informal alliance of the US, Japan, Australia and India – and the AUKUS deal for nuclear-powered submarines between the US, Australia and the UK as well as other economic, diplomatic and military initiatives.  “I think that has given our allies confidence, like Japan, to increase the defense budget, to be more active on the diplomatic arena and stage,” he said, giving credit to Tokyo for getting eight of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to vote to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a March 3 United Nations General Assembly vote.  Countries around the world will respond to Japan, or South Korea, or the US for a simple reason that China doesn’t understand, “the gravitational pull of freedom,” Emanuel said.  “A rules-based system that upholds respect both for the individual and in trying to uphold freedom has its own, I don’t know how else to say it, but seductive gravitational pull.”    CNN’s Nectar Gan, Emiko Jozuka and Alex Stambaugh contributed to this report.

Video Ad FeedbackZelensky responds to video showing apparent execution of unarmed Ukrainian soldier    03:44   - Source:CNNCNN      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to “find the murderers” involved in a video that he said showed the execution of a Ukrainian soldier by Russian troops, as officials in Kyiv roundly condemned the incident as a war crime.   The video shows an unarmed troop allegedly in Russian captivity wearing Ukrainian combat fatigues and smoking a cigarette, near what appears to be a fighting position.   The man is then shown pulling the cigarette from his mouth, blowing out the smoke and saying, “Slava Ukraini (Glory to Ukraine),” before being executed, with fighters off camera firing several shots at him.  This screengrab from the video purportedly shows a captured Ukrainian soldier moments before he is killed.From Social MediaThe Ukrainian Army’s 30th Mechanized Brigade named the soldier on Tuesday as Tymofii Mykolayovych Shadura.  The brigade said in a Facebook post that Shadura was part of the contingent and had been missing since February 3 after fighting near the eastern city of Bakhmut, as the battle for control of the eastern Donetsk region intensifies.  “Currently, the body of our serviceman is on the temporarily occupied territory. The final confirmation of his identity will be established after the body is returned and the relevant examinations are conducted,” the brigade’s post added.   President Volodymyr Zelensky, pictured on February 24, 2023, condemned footage seemingly showing the execution of a Ukrainian soldier by Russian troops.Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout/ReutersZelensky denounced the video and said it shows “how the occupiers brutally killed a warrior.”   “Today, a video has been released showing how the occupiers brutally killed a warrior who bravely said to their faces: ‘Glory to Ukraine,’” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Monday. “I want us all to respond to his words in unity: ‘Glory to the hero. Glory to heroes. Glory to Ukraine.’”  “We will find the murderers,” he added.  CNN has not been able to independently verify who the executed soldier is, where he was shot, and who shot him. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian defense ministry to get further details on the incident, and to the Russian defense ministry for a response. Russia has consistently denied accusations that its soldiers have committed war crimes during its invasion, despite evidence to the contrary. ‘Genocidal’The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, described the footage as “a manifestation of rascality and ignobility.”  “The execution of a captured Ukrainian soldier is a violation of the Geneva Conventions,” Lubinets wrote on Telegram, adding that he has shared the video with international allies “as evidence of yet another Russian war crime.”   “All over the world the words ‘Glory to Ukraine’ evoke honor, respect and pride, the Russians execute people for the Ukrainian slogan.”  Lubinets added that it was “painful” to see what Russian forces were doing in his country.  Viktor Sevalnev was sent from prison to fight for Russia in Ukraine. But not by Wagner.CNNExclusive: Russian convicts say defense ministry is sending them from jail to fight as 'cannon fodder' in UkraineUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the video was additional “proof” that Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was “genocidal,” and called on the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation into “this heinous war crime.”  “Perpetrators must face justice,” Kuleba tweeted Monday.  Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, also called the incident a “war crime.”  Western allies of Kyiv have called for greater measures to hold Moscow accountable amid accusations of crimes against humanity since the war began in February 2022, including targeted killings of civilians, the forcible transfers of children and sexual assault incidents.    US Attorney General Merrick Garland reaffirmed Washington’s “determination to hold Russia accountable for crimes” during an unannounced trip to Ukraine on Friday.    The US Justice Department has taken several steps to hold the Russian government and its supporters accountable since the invasion began.  On Wednesday, Garland testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he believed the Russian government was committing crimes against humanity and said the Justice Department supports efforts by The Hague to investigate and prosecute those crimes.  It came days after the US State Department imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian officials and entities involved in the war, including three senior Russian military leaders who will be blocked from entering the country due to their involvement “in gross violations of human rights perpetrated against Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of wars,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

According to PA Media, the Eurovision tickets were scheduled to be released at 7 a.m. ET, but ticket buyers were met with a server error message just minutes before the tickets were due to go on sale.   Ticketmaster appeared to be working again after 10 minutes, PA Media reported, with fans able to join a virtual line to buy tickets.  Tickets for the event are now sold out.   A spokesperson for Ticketmaster told CNN that only “a very small number of fans experienced issues accessing the queue.”   “Ticket sales were unaffected, and thousands of fans secured their seats for the Eurovision Song Contest,” they added.   The ticketing site ran into trouble in mid-November when heavy demand for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour snarled the platform, infuriating millions of fans who couldn’t snag tickets.   Unable to resolve the problem, Ticketmaster subsequently canceled the sale of tickets to Swift’s concerts to the general public, citing “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand.”  The fiasco has prompted US lawmakers to investigate whether Ticketmaster has a monopoly on selling tickets for events, resulting in higher prices for customers.   This year’s Eurovision takes place in May in Liverpool in the United Kingdom on May 13. The United Kingdom came second to Ukraine in last year’s competition, but has agreed to host the event on behalf of that country as it remains embroiled in a war with Russia.   — Samantha Murphy Kelly contributed reporting.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under fire from opposition parties to immediately call a wide-ranging public inquiry into allegations of election interference. Sean Kilpatrick/APOttawaCNN      Amid recent allegations that China attempted to meddle in Canada’s 2019 and 2021 elections, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would appoint an independent investigator or rapporteur to help identify and combat foreign interference in Canada’s elections and its democracy.  “We have long known, and an independent report confirmed it again last week, that the Chinese government and other regimes like Iran and Russia have attempted to interfere not just in our democracy but in our country in general, whether it’s our institutions, our businesses, our research facilities or in the daily lives of our citizens,” said Trudeau Monday during a press conference in Ottawa.  Trudeau added that he was taking new investigative steps to safeguard democracy saying foreign actors were looking to foster instability in Canada. But he underscored that multiple reports have so far determined that despite foreign influence attempts, the results of the 2019 federal election and the 2021 election were not impacted.  Trudeau, who is under fire from opposition parties to immediately call a wide-ranging public inquiry into the issue, said that decision would be up to the rapporteur.    “We will ask the independent special rapporteur as one of the first tasks of their mandate to provide the government with a recommendation as to what the appropriate next step should be whether it be an inquiry and investigation or a judicial review and what the scope of that work may be and we will abide by their recommendation,” he said.  China has reacted angrily to allegations of interference in Canadian elections in recent days calling the accusations “total nonsense.”  “It must be pointed out that only those well-versed in spying can fabricate the outrageous lies as reported in the media,” read a statement, in part, from China’s embassy spokesperson in Ottawa. “Only those accustomed to interfering in other countries’ internal affairs are prone to suspicion and preoccupied with playing the trick of feigning innocence and calling others a thief.”  Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on Thursday also denied the allegations, saying during a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly during a G20 meeting, “China never interferes with other countries’ internal politics, and opposes any country interfering other countries’ internal politics.” Calls for public inquiryCanada’s opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, said only a full public inquiry will “get to the bottom” of what actually happened with regards to foreign interference.  “Justin Trudeau has known about this interference for a decade because it was ten years ago that the Trudeau foundation got its $200,000 (Canadian dollar) donation from a Beijing backed donor and ever since we know that the government in Beijing has been trying to influence and support Justin Trudeau,” said Poilievre during a press conference Monday.  Poilievre was referring to a Globe and Mail newspaper report that a foundation named after Trudeau’s father, Pierre, a former prime minister of Canada, had received a $200,000 (Canadian dollar) donation in 2016 from two wealthy Chinese businessmen to fund scholarships and leadership programs.  Poilievre claims those connections go back to 2013 when the younger Trudeau first entered politics.  A spokesperson for Trudeau’s office said that the prime minister withdrew his involvement in any affairs of his father’s namesake foundation when he entered federal politics nearly a decade ago.  In a statement last week, the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation said it would refund the donation in light of recent media reports, and in keeping with its role as an independent, non-partisan charity. The foundation said it would not accept any donation that “may have been sponsored by a foreign government,” according to the statement.  In a government report released last week, Morris Rosenberg, a former public servant charged with looking into attempts to influence Canada’s 2021 election, concluded that foreign actors attempted to meddle but that they did not influence the outcome of the elections.  Rosenberg himself was the CEO of the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation in 2016 when the Chinese businessmen made the donation.

US senators unveil bipartisan bill empowering Biden to ban TikTok and other services    			By Brian Fung, CNN		  Updated  3:45 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackCybersecurity expert talks TikTok concerns    06:13   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      A dozen US senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Tuesday expanding President Joe Biden’s legal authority to ban TikTok nationwide, marking the latest in a string of congressional proposals threatening the social media platform’s future in the United States.  The legislation, called the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act, does not target TikTok specifically for a ban. But it aims to give the US government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk.  Adobe StockHouse panel votes to advance bill empowering Biden to ban TikTokThe proposed law takes a wide-ranging approach to fears that companies with ties to China could be pressured by that country’s government into handing over Americans’ sensitive personal information or communications records. In the case of TikTok, lawmakers have said China’s national security laws could force TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to provide access to TikTok’s US user data.   TikTok CEO Shou Chew said this week the company has never received such a request from the Chinese government and would never comply with one. The company has taken voluntary steps to wall off US user data from the rest of its global organization, including by hosting that data on servers operated by the US tech giant Oracle. The company is also negotiating a possible agreement with the Biden administration that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under certain conditions.   In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said a US government ban would stifle American speech and would be “a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.”  But that has not stopped many policymakers from seeking tougher measures against the company.   Last week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced a bill that would require the Biden administration to issue a nationwide TikTok ban if an assessment of the platform found potential risks to US user data — risks that multiple administration officials have already said exist.   Another bill led by Sen. Marco Rubio would ban transactions by social media companies based in or under the “substantial influence” of countries considered US foreign adversaries.  Tuesday’s bill, unveiled by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner and South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune, is less prescriptive — granting the Commerce Department wide discretion to identify, and then to mitigate, perceived risks stemming from technology produced by companies with ties to foreign adversaries including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela.   The bill specifically directs the Secretary of Commerce to “identify, deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise mitigate” national security risks associated with technology linked to those countries. It enables the Commerce Secretary to negotiate, enter into, impose and enforce “any mitigation measure” in response.   That latitude would reflect an entirely new authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce, not authority derived from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.   The legislation would cover a broad range of technologies in addition to social media, Warner said, including artificial intelligence, financial technology services, quantum computing and e-commerce. The bill’s text also prioritizes technology in satellite and mobile networks, cloud services and storage, internet infrastructure providers, home internet gear, commercial and personal drones, video games and payment apps, among others.   Under the bill, the US government would also be required to declassify and share evidence gathered by the intelligence community to substantiate allegations that a given company or product poses a national security risk.  The bill would shift US policy away from an ad hoc scramble focused on individual companies, and provide the US government with a systematic legal structure for addressing tech-driven spying threats, Warner said.   In recent years, US concerns about Chinese espionage have largely focused on telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE, who produce wireless gear for cellular networks. But those have expanded to include makers of surveillance cameras and, more recently, apps and software makers such as TikTok.  “Instead of playing whack-a-mole on Huawei one day, ZTE the next, Kasperky, TikTok — we need a more comprehensive approach to evaluating and mitigating these threats posed by these foreign technologies from these adversarial nations,” said Warner, adding that the bill was crafted in consultation with the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Justice and Treasury, along with US intelligence officials, the Federal Communications Commission and the White House.  In a statement, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan endorsed the bill, calling it “a systematic framework for addressing technology-based threats to the security and safety of Americans.”  “This will help us address the threats we face today, and also prevent such risks from arising in the future,” Sullivan said.  Warner added that the legislation has “sparked a lot of interest” from other senators beyond the 12 co-sponsors and among some members of the House in both parties.

This grave of a horse rider was discovered at a burial mound in Malomirovo, Bulgaria.Michał PodsiadłoSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.CNN      Skeletons unearthed from graves in southeastern Europe bear the earliest known evidence of horse riding in the archaeological record, new research has revealed.  Horseback riding was a pivotal development in human history — transforming agriculture, transport and warfare — but exactly when humans figured out how to clamber on a horse’s back and steer the animals to go from points A to B has been difficult to pin down.   However, a study published last week in the journal Science Advances found that nine people buried 4,500 to 5,000 years ago who lived in what’s now Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary had patterns of wear on their leg bones, spines and pelvises that suggest they regularly rode horses.   Przewalski's horses, like the one pictured here, are thought to be closest in size and appearance to those ridden by the Yamnaya people.  Annika Sorjonen/Korkeasaari ZooThe researchers examined 217 skeletons found in burial mounds called kurgans in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia.   To detect whether the people buried in the graves were horse riders, the researchers outlined six criteria they said were hallmarks of horse riding. For example, the up-and-down movement associated with the activity can damage the spinal vertebrae, and the use of thighs to grip the horse can result in wear at the point where the thigh muscles join the thigh bones.   “Bones reflect the life of a person,” said lead study author Martin Trautmann, a bioanthropologist at the University of Helsinki.   “If you sit on horseback, and especially if you don’t have stirrups, you have to hold fast. And you do that by clenching your legs together and the hip abductor muscles. You also have to balance all the time to avoid slipping from the horse. So the trunk muscles have to keep you erect in relation to your pelvis,” he explained, adding that modern-day horse riders, such as cowboys, showed similar patterns of skeletal wear and tear.   In total, 24 individuals in the graves studied showed some of these signs — although only nine of the skeletons studied displayed at least four of the six criteria, which clearly marks them as horse riders, according to the study. Of these nine, all thought to be the remains of men, five had five of the characteristics and one well-preserved skeleton from Romania exhibited all six.   Most of the skeletons belonged to a group of people known as the Yamnaya, cattle and sheep herders who originated on the Pontic-Caspian steppe that stretches from southeastern Europe into Kazakhstan, skirting north of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea along the way.   Archaeological excavations at a burial mound in Malomirovo, Bulgaria. Michał Podsiadło“You can call them the first nomads in the world,” said study coauthor Volker Heyd, a professor of archaeology at the University of Helsinki. “From the end of the fourth millennium BC onwards, we see them spreading towards the east and the west. They were on a dramatic expansion drive. In relation to our findings that they were riding horses, then this expansion over 5,000 or 6,000 kilometers makes sense.”   It’s thought that horses were likely first domesticated for meat and milk before being ridden.   DNA analysis has suggested that horses were first domesticated about 4,300 years ago in the steppes of the Black Sea region, part of modern-day Russia, before spreading across Asia and Europe in the centuries that followed.  The first horse-drawn chariots are thought to have been used about 4,000 years ago.

Here’s why    			Analysis by Clare Sebastian, CNN		  Updated  1:57 AM EST, Tue March 7, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackSatellite images show changes Russia are making to occupied nuclear plant    03:36   - Source:CNNLondonCNN      Much of Russia’s energy exports have been hit by Western sanctions since the country launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with a notable exception — nuclear power.   Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy monopoly Rosatom, which exports and enriches uranium as well as builds nuclear power stations around the world, has been in control of Europe’s largest nuclear plant in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region since Russian forces seized it a year ago.  Kyiv has accused Russian forces of turning the complex into a military base and using it as cover to launch attacks, knowing that Ukraine can’t return fire without risking hitting one of the plant’s reactors. Ukraine has also blamed Russia for explosions at the site, including late last year.   Petro Kotin, interim president of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Energoatom, is worried about the militarization of the plant, but also a significant reduction in the number of qualified staff on site. The Russian press service for the plant told CNN that new employees are being recruited, “which ensures [its] safe operation.”  If anything happens, Energoatom “cannot jump in and actually mitigate any consequences or mitigate any emergency” because Russia controls the territory, Kotin said.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko/File PhotoAlexander Ermochenko/ReutersEurope's largest nuclear plant is under threat. But experts say a Chernobyl-sized disaster is unlikelyDespite what Kotin described as the rising risk of a mistake or breach of safety protocols at the Zaporizhzhia plant, and repeated calls by Kyiv for sanctions on Rosatom, the Russian company remains largely unscathed, although the United Kingdom sanctioned its top management and several subsidiaries last month, and Finland terminated a power plant deal last May.    Experts say Rosatom remains protected by the vital role it plays in global nuclear power, and the fact it can’t easily be replaced.   The problem is a “Russian doll’s worth of interlocking dependencies,” says Paul Dorfman, chair of Nuclear Consulting Group and a long-time advisor to the UK government and the nuclear industry.   To start with, Rosatom is a key exporter of nuclear fuel. In 2021, the United States relied on the Russian nuclear monopoly for 14% of the uranium that powered its nuclear reactors. European utilities bought almost a fifth of their nuclear fuel from Rosatom. According to Dorfman, the European Union has made little progress since weaning itself off Russia’s nuclear industry.   Rosatom also provides enrichment services, accounting for 28% of what the United States required in 2021.  It has built numerous nuclear plants around the world and in some cases financed their construction. At the end of 2021, almost one in five of the world’s nuclear power plants were in Russia or Russian-built, and Rosatom is building 15 more outside of Russia, according to Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.  Kacper Szulecki, a research professor at the Norwegian Institute of International affairs, says the cost of building a nuclear power plant is so high that it can only be financed by governments, and in some cases even they can’t afford it. In those cases, Rosatom has often stepped in, offering credit lines guaranteed by the Russian government and in some cases long-term contracts to provide fuel for or even run the plant.   Szulecki, who co-authored a recent paper on Russia’s nuclear industry, says the most extreme of these kinds of deals is the build-own-operate model. It was first used by Rosatom with Turkey’s Akkuyu power plant, which the corporation is building, fully financing and has committed to operating for its entire lifetime.   The Akkuyu nuclear power plant as its construction continues in November 2022Serkan Avci/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesSuch dependency can trump other considerations. For example, Hungary has been the European Union’s most vocal opponent of sanctions on Rosatom. It is also one of only several EU countries that rely on nuclear energy for more than 40% of their electricity and it has a long-term financing deal with Rosatom to build a nuclear power plant.   Experts say finding new suppliers to replace Rosatom in the global nuclear industry would take years.  That may be why, far from deterring future customers, Rosatom’s occupation of the Zaporizhzhia plant has coincided with growth in the company’s foreign revenue. Its Director General Aleksey Likhachev told Russian newspaper Izvestiya in December that overseas revenue was on track to rise by about 15% in 2022 compared with 2021.  For his part, Kotin at Energoatom believes Rosatom is maintaining the equipment at the plant so poorly that the Russian occupation may cause irreversible damage.   If it continues for another year, “then I’m sure we won’t be able to restart this plant,” he said.  Diplomatic efforts to hand the control of the plant back to Ukraine have stalled, Ukraine’s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on the weekend.    Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine itself of shelling the Zaporizhzhia plant and, in an email to CNN, Rosatom’s press service for the plant denied there’s heavy military equipment on the site.

Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, speaks during a meeting on Capitol Hill, February 1, 2023 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesCNN      House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan has subpoenaed the former executive director for the Department of Homeland Security’s Disinformation Governance Board, Nina Jankowicz, according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.  The move is a sign Jordan intends to probe Jankowicz’s brief tenure at the now-disbanded disinformation board, which was met with intense backlash from Republican and conservative media, as part of his effort to show the federal government has been “weaponized” against conservatives. Jankowicz’s deposition is scheduled April 10.  Jankowicz responded to news of the subpoena in a statement, saying she will not be “cowed by conspiracy theories or intimidation.”  “I will happily testify to the truth of the Board under oath: That it was a working group meant to curb disinformation that endangered Americans’ safety, and that — because of the Republican Party’s irresponsible lies about it — our democracy is less secure,” she said.  Jordan had previously requested that Jankowicz appear for a transcribed interview to discuss her brief role as the executive director of the Disinformation Governance Board created by the Department of Homeland Security.  Jankowicz resigned in May 2022 after her appointment drew condemnation from GOP lawmakers and right-wing media personalities, who pointed to her past tweets and statements regarding the laptop of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Steele dossier. When she resigned, Jankowicz responded to more of the attacks she had received, defending her work.  The Disinformation Governance Board has since been dissolved.  An interagency team, the board was intended to coordinate department activities related to disinformation aimed at the US population and infrastructure. Jankowicz, a disinformation expert with experience working on Ukraine and Russia issues, was tapped to helm the board, along with two senior DHS officials, including acting Principal Deputy General Counsel Jen Daskal.  Jordan has called the now disbanded board “an anti-democratic and un-American attempt to establish a de facto Ministry of Truth within the federal government.”  At the time, DHS and the White House defended the board and called Jankowicz “imminently qualified,” but eventually decided to pause the initiative and call for a review. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas later acknowledged the confusing rollout of the working group and in August DHS shut down the board.More subpoenas as part of probe into Biden administration’s response to school board threatsJordan also issued two subpoenas to individuals affiliated with the National School Boards Association who were involved in the response to protests and some violence that erupted at school board meetings across the country starting in 2021.   Jordan subpoenaed the president of the board, Viola Garcia, and its former interim executive director and CEO, Chip Slaven, for depositions as the panel continues to investigate whether a Justice Department strategy to address threats against teachers and school officials was abused to target conservative parents. The FBI has denied that it ever investigated or policed speech at school board meetings or anywhere else.    CNN has reached out to Garcia and Slaven for comment.  The committee gave Garcia a deposition date of March 16 and Slaven a deposition date of March 17.  Jordan had previously subpoenaed the Justice Department, the FBI and the Department of Education in relation to the matter.  Much of the anger at school boards came from conservative parents who wanted to repeal mask mandates, opposed anti-racism courses and had concerns about LGBTQ policies.  With that backdrop, the National School Boards Association wrote to Biden asking for federal help to address the violence and threats against school administrators. The group said that “these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism” and encouraged the Justice Department to explore which laws, possibly including the Patriot Act, could be applied.  The group soon apologized for “some of the language” in its letter. But it quickly drew backlash, particularly among conservatives.   Attorney General Merrick Garland had issued a memo in response – which didn’t cite the letter, compare parents to “terrorists” nor invoke the Patriot Act. It merely told the FBI and federal prosecutors to step up collaboration with state and local law enforcement on the issue.  According to a report Jordan released last year, emails show that the Biden White House consulted with the NSBA on the letter before the group made its letter public. An independent review by NSBA concluded, however, that there was no “direct or indirect evidence suggesting the Administration requested the Letter” or reviewed the contents before the letter was sent.  Other emails also show that the Justice Department sent an advance copy of Garland’s memo to the NSBA.   The FBI later established a “threat tag” to internally track cases about school board threats under the same categorization. Jordan said in his subpoena letters to Garcia and Slaven that whistleblowers have disclosed that the memorandum led to the establishment of a threat tag.   Republicans have seized on the “threat tag” to accuse the FBI of carrying out Biden’s desire to stomp out conservative speech at school boards. But the creation of an internal database does not mean the FBI initiated any sort of crackdown against parents.  This story has been updated with additional developments.

Video Ad FeedbackAfter 40+ years, 'History of the World, Part II'    02:00   - Source:CNNCNN      Recognizing the inevitably hit-miss nature of sketch comedy, the main question for “History of the World, Part II” is whether the Hulu series yields enough good stuff to justify this extension of the 1981 movie from Mel Brooks, rightfully billed here as an “American treasure.” The show squeaks by, barely, though this is one of those exercises where a little fast-forwarding through “History” couldn’t hurt.  To its credit the series generally matches the irreverence of the original, which was produced in a different comedy era, testing whether it’s possible to still be that proudly offensive. Brooks (now 96, incidentally) introduces the show and the various sketches, which feature an assortment of regulars and guests that includes Nick Kroll, Ike Barinholtz and Wanda Sykes, who, along with Brooks, serve as executive producers.  Musical numbers play a role in the merriment, another Brooks staple, although there’s nothing that quite rivals the giddy absurdity of a song-and-dance routine devoted to the Spanish Inquisition.  Much of the comedy involves updating the gags through the current media moment, from ESPN-style sideline interviews with General Grant during the Civil War to “The Real Concubines of Kublai Khan.”  “History of the World” also revels in inside-showbiz humor, such as William Shakespeare (Josh Gad) running a TV writers’ room, or cheekily filtering the story of Jesus through a movie studio that turns it into what looks like a Rambo movie, down to the trailer’s muscular hero.  Quinta Brunson, J.B. Smoove and Zazie Beetz in ""History of the World, Part II,"" premiering on Hulu.Aaron Epstein/HuluPerhaps of necessity, the show fleshes out the episodes by returning to the same sketches multiple times, from a “Fiddler on the Roof”-inspired ode to Russia during the revolution to a ’70s-style sitcom featuring Wanda Sykes as one-time presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm (titled “Shirley,” naturally), complete with an overbearing laugh track.  Not surprisingly, “History of the World” leans into low-brow fare, such as a reenactment of the D-Day invasion that turns into perhaps the longest vomiting scene since “Team America: World Police.”  Brooks might be an “American treasure,” but the first “History of the World” – which followed his most memorable creative and commercial stretch in the 1970s – isn’t exactly fodder for the time capsule, something to keep in mind appraising this version. Hulu will drop the eight half-hours in pairs over successive days, an interesting strategy for a project that doesn’t need to be consumed in any particular order.  On the plus side, the show has no obvious aspirations beyond following the first commandment of comedy – be funny – and if the series does well enough to merit a “Part III,” Brooks and company certainly won’t suffer from a lack of material. After all, they have the whole “World” in their hands.  “History of the World, Part II” premieres March 6 on Hulu.

Video Ad FeedbackJill Biden reacts to Nikki Haley's call for presidential competency test    00:31   - Source:CNNCNN      First lady Dr. Jill Biden warned parts of East Africa are “on the precipice” of famine as the region is dealing with a severe drought, threatening livelihoods and the ability of families to feed their children.  Her comments came in a series of wide-ranging interviews during a recent five-day trip to Africa that were part of “CNN Primetime: Jill Biden Abroad.” In the interviews, she shared her thoughts about the 2024 presidential campaign, weighed in on the classified documents found at their Wilmington, Delaware, home, and talked about life as first lady, including relationships with the women who held the role in the past.  As the Bidens prepare for a possible 2024 presidential campaign, the first lady pushed back on concerns about President Joe Biden’s age, citing his recent travel schedule as reflective of his stamina.  “How many 30-year-olds could travel to Poland, get on the train? Go nine more hours, go to Ukraine, meet with President (Volodymyr) Zelensky?” she said. “So, look at the man. Look what he’s doing. Look what he continues to do each and every day.”  Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has called for politicians over the age of 75 to take mental competency tests, which the first lady called, “Ridiculous.” Asked if her husband, who would be 82 at his inauguration if he’s reelected, would ever take such a test, she said, “We would never even discuss something like that.”  During an extensive sit-down with CNN, Jill Biden said she “absolutely” believes her husband will run for reelection in 2024, saying she’s “all for it.” But the first lady also left an opening for her husband should he decide against a run.“It’s Joe’s decision,” she said. “And we support whatever he wants to do. If he’s in, we’re there. If he wants to do something else, we’re there too.”  The first lady said her family has not had one definitive sit-down meeting to discuss a reelection bid as has been typical for the Biden clan in the past, saying instead there’s been a series of rolling conversations with their children and grandchildren.  She said the wave of investigations into her son, Hunter Biden, a frequent target for Republicans, has not affected the family’s thinking about 2024.  “I love Hunter, and I’ll support him … in any way I can. And that’s how I look at things,” she said.  The first lady also weighed in for the first time on the revelation that classified documents were found at the president’s Wilmington residence and a private office in Washington, DC, which prompted the Justice Department to assign a special counsel to investigate the matter.  CNNvideo    Hear what first lady thinks about Biden's reelection plans“I was really surprised. We had no idea,” she said, noting the documents at their Wilmington home were in the garage. “Believe me, Arlette, I haven’t been, I mean, I don’t have time to go through, you know, the boxes in the garage. We had no idea they were even down there.” The first lady in Africa The first lady traveled to Africa for visits to Namibia and Kenya to emphasize the United States’ commitment to the region at a time when Russia and China have made in-roads on the continent.  “America wants to keep reassuring the countries and the leaders of Africa, like - ‘We didn’t forget you.’ You know, we were isolationist, pretty much for the last four years of the last administration,” she said in a critique of former President Donald Trump. “We want to say, ‘Hey, we’re back.’”  It marked her sixth trip to Africa after having traveled to the continent five times as second lady. She focused on delivering messages about women’s empowerment, youth engagement, and the need to preserve democracy.  Biden also highlighted programs funded through PEPFAR, the Bush-era initiative focused on fighting HIV/AIDS around the globe, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.  On her final day in Kenya, the first lady looked to shine a spotlight on the severe drought affecting the region. She traveled to the rural village of Lositeti in Kajiado County to tour a health clinic offering services to the community.   Nearly 500 patients, many of them children, received treatment that day, including medical and malnutrition check-ups and nutritional assistance, according to the US Agency for International Development.  “Livestock is dying. There’s no water. There’s no grass. There are no crops. Mothers can’t lactate. They’re not able to feed their children. It’s a major problem,” she said. “I’m here before it gets any worse to try to create awareness and say, ‘How can we find solutions for these major problems?’”  In Kenya, officials say more than 4 million people have insufficient access to food, with that figure expected to rise above 5 million in the coming months.  The first lady noted the US provides 70% of financial assistance to the drought-plagued region and urged other countries to pitch in with more aid.  “Everybody has to come together to make sure that these people aren’t dying because of the drought,” she said. “Because believe me … they have nothing. They have nothing and their children are malnourished.”  In 2011, Biden visited the same region to highlight the impact of drought and famine. She toured the country’s largest refugee camp in Dadaab, where more than 100,000 Somali refugees fled to amid famine and conflict.   “We’re right on the precipice I think of a famine,” she told CNN. “We’re right on the edge. We need to act now.” Reflecting on Jimmy Carter and other first ladies The first lady also reflected on the legacy of former President Jimmy Carter, who recently started receiving hospice care.  “I think he’ll be remembered as a great humanitarian, I mean, all that he has done to help people,” she said. “He never stopped. He never stopped helping Americans, whether it was Habitat for Humanity, building homes, or going into communities, traveling the world helping people all over.”  The president and first lady visited with Carter and his wife, former first Lady Rosalynn Carter, at their Plains, Georgia, home in 2021. Dr. Biden said the two men “talked politics the whole time and what was going on, and they have a real ease in with one another,” and she praised the couple’s seven-decades long marriage.  “She’s so much a part of his life,” she said. “It’s a really strong partnership.”  Biden said Rosalynn Carter has “always been very supportive, as have quite frankly, most of the first ladies. “  “If you ever need anything or you want to talk or if there’s something … on your mind, or if I can help you in some way, they’ve all been great,” she said.  Asked if she’s spoken with former first lady Melania Trump, she responded: “Not Melania.”  The first lady said she plans to offer advice to future first spouses, saying “if they ask, of course, I mean, it’s a very small number, at this point, of women, and I think we have to support one another.”Insight into the Bidens’ marriageBiden also offered a window into her marriage, saying she maintains a “good balance” in the types of insight and advice she offers her husband.  “Certainly I tell him stories, and I have things that I’ve seen and things that people want and where their challenges are,” she said. “So, it’s not that I’m like weighing in. It’s like, let me tell you what I saw or what I heard, or what people are saying to me.”  “It’s in that context because I’m out every day. I’m in the classroom. I’m out, you know, somewhere in the United States,” she added. “I think it’s a good balance really.”  Biden said her husband helps her understand there are different ways of looking at issues and viewpoints.  “Well, sometimes I don’t, I may not see things from his perspective. Let’s just put it that way. And so, he offers both sides,” she said. “I’m always better like ‘This person feels this way.” ‘Yes, but this is why they,’ – you know, he’s very good at that – understanding why people feel the way they do. He understands both sides, which is part of his strength.”  Biden, who has been married to the president for nearly 46 years, has long said she’s not an adviser to her husband, but she is his most trusted partner and wields a significant amount of influence within the White House.   The couple speaks often via text and FaceTime throughout the day as they both maintain busy work and travel schedules with the first lady saying the president “calls a lot.”  Biden said she “said a lot of prayers” when her husband made a highly secretive to Kyiv, Ukraine – an active war zone where the US military has no control – last month.  “I was really worried. But you know, one thing, and I have to say this with all my heart. One thing that I truly believe in is the strength of our military, and how everything was so planned out, and the Secret Service, and what an amazing job they did, in pulling off the trip, and keeping my husband safe,” she said.A unique first lady Biden plays a unique role as first lady, the first to hold a full-time paid job outside of the White House. She teaches English and writing full time at Northern Virginia Community College, a job she also held for her eight years as second lady when her husband was vice president.   From her perch at the White House, she has spent time advocating for education issues, helping military families through her “Joining Forces” initiative and working to end cancer through the “Cancer Moonshot.” The first lady is one of the Biden administration’s most often used surrogates at events across the country.  “I think it’s all so interesting and really fulfilling for me as, as a teacher, and as a woman, you know, to see the empowerment of other young women in them getting education,” she said when asked how she balance the two roles. “There’s nothing I can ever give up.”  “I really feel like I’ve grown so much in this role, because of the opportunities that I’ve been given whether it’s traveling to Africa, or whether it’s traveling to Nebraska,” she added. “I see so many different communities and reach out to people in all walks of life.”  Biden said her experiences as an educator and first lady have helped her build connections with people during her travels abroad, which has included trips to 10 countries in her first two years in the White House.   “Joe tends towards policy,” she said. “I try to, you know, go in a little bit maybe a softer direction.”  While in Africa, Biden held events with the first ladies of Namibia and Kenya, telling CNN it’s important to cultivate those types of relationships abroad.  “One thing Joe taught me is that all politics is personal, and that’s true because once you have these connections, I think you can call on someone when you need help, when you need to be lifted up, when you can support programs,” she said.

The ex-president and the Florida governor’s escalating shadow campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to exacerbate the already growing antipathy among grassroots conservatives for being Ukraine’s arsenal of democracy.  This should worry the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has profusely thanked Americans for their multi-billion dollar generosity while warning he will keep asking for more.  Video Ad Feedback'If I were Donald Trump, I'd be really worried': Gergen on possible DeSantis showdown    02:39   - Source:CNNA bitter Republican primary that turns on the isolationist sentiment of the party’s “Make America Great Again” wing could produce a nominee, and possibly a 47th president, who could shelve the assurance of Joe Biden that Americans will stand by Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”   There are already early signs of ebbing public support for Biden’s repeated aid and arms packages for Ukraine a year after Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally, has warned against a “blank check” for Ukraine. The reaction of the ex-president’s proteges in the GOP-controlled House to Biden’s daring secret visit to Kyiv last month suggests that the 2024 Republican nominee will surely cater to a base that believes the US should spend its money securing its own borders instead of Ukraine’s and that Biden cares more for foreigners than Americans.  Donald J. Trump (L) and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.Getty ImagesTrump and DeSantis stake out sharpest preview yet of possible 2024 showdownRecent polling helps explain the GOP positioning on Ukraine. Support for the US providing weapons to the country has decreased compared with last spring, according to an AP-NORC survey conducted in late January, and that decline was sharper among Republicans – down to 39% from 53% in May 2022.   Trump has no love lost for Zelensky, after what he misleading described as their “perfect” 2019 phone call, in which the then-president tried to use US military aid to extort his counterpart into opening an investigation into Biden. The incident led to Trump’s first impeachment. More recently, in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Trump seemed eager to rekindle his genuflecting relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom much of the world now regards as a war criminal. And the need to defend a democracy that is under attack is a foreign concept to Trump at home, let alone abroad.  “Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled. … I will get the problem solved. And I will get it solved in rapid order and it will take me no longer than one day,” Trump said. “I know exactly what to say to each of them,” he added, before hinting at a potential strategy of siding with the aggressor in the war by reminding his audience, “I got along very well with Putin.”  DeSantis, whose foreign policy views remain mostly a mystery, has not been as clear as Trump on what he would do in Ukraine. After all, he’s not even a declared candidate yet, despite fresh signs he is heading in that direction. But he appeared to try to catch up with Trump when warning in a recent Fox News interview that the Biden administration had “no clear, strategic objective identified” in Ukraine and that it was not in US interests to get involved in a proxy war with China there, after the White House warned Beijing could start sending arms to Russia.  This is an evolution from his position as a congressman in 2014 and 2015, when he strongly supported arming Ukraine to fight Russia, CNN’s KFile reported.   Getty ImagesGOP 2024 hopefuls divided over US role in Ukraine warPutin, of course, is listening. The Russian leader appears to be digging in for a forever war in Ukraine – where he has already been entrenched since 2014 after the illegal annexation of Crimea. Even hints that a new Republican president would cut Kyiv loose would play into his apparent belief that, eventually, the West will get tired and splinter. After all, Germany only agreed to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine after Biden also agreed that more advanced US M1 Abrams tanks would also be shipped to the battlefield.  And even if Kyiv prevails in the conflict, or reaches a currently unlikely peace deal with Moscow, its future could rely on being a de facto NATO protectorate armed with Western weapons and even security guarantees from major US or European powers that some future Republican presidents, judging by current rhetoric, might be loath to honor.  Not every Republican agrees with Trump or DeSantis on Ukraine. Many of the key committee chairmen in the House, for instance, back current or even increased aid and military hardware for Ukraine and support its call for F-16 fighter jets that Biden has declined to send. And several potential Republican primary candidates also support the US effort. Former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who launched her campaign last month and paints herself as a would-be scourge of strongmen leaders like Putin and China’s Xi Jinping, tweeted last year: “This isn’t just a war for Ukraine, this is a war for freedom.”  But presidential primaries have a habit of defining a party’s positions at the extremes – and with Trump and DeSantis being seen as the current favorites, their rivals may come under increasing pressure to fall into line to ensure their own political viability.  Ukraine’s primary focus is on the battle, amid fresh signs that its desperate resistance in the city of Bakhmut may be about to be broken.  But the possibility of changing political conditions in the United States as a new White House campaign begins means that Zelensky’s desperation for more weapons and ammunition to eject Putin’s forces from Ukraine will only become more urgent.Trump sees an opening to go after DeSantis on UkraineTrump made clear in his appearance at CPAC that if he gets the chance to confront Biden in a repeat of the 2020 election, he will accuse the Democrat of leading the planet to the brink of disaster.  “I am the only candidate who can make this promise, I will prevent, very easily, World War III,” Trump said in a speech riddled with falsehoods. “We are going to have World War III, by the way, if something doesn’t happen fast.”  The former president is in some ways repeating his 2016 tactic of warning about America’s exposure to foreign wars. He’s trying to fan fatigue over US arms-length involvement in Ukraine as he did over the long conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.  And he drove home another familiar criticism of presidents who fixate on foreign policy by showing up in East Palestine, Ohio – at the site of a chemical spill after a freight train derailment – while Biden was visiting Europe last month.  “I sincerely hope that when your representatives and all of the politicians get here, including Biden, they get back from touring Ukraine, that he’s got some money left over,” Trump said.  CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported Monday that the former president also sees an opening to target DeSantis over his calls as a congressional candidate in 2012 to privatize some social benefits by suggesting he is not sufficiently in line with the GOP base in stopping financial and military aid to Ukraine.  “We are never going back to a party that wants to give unlimited money to fight foreign endless wars but demands we cut veteran benefits and retirement benefits at home,” Trump said during his CPAC speech.  Video Ad Feedback'Absolute fiction': Daniel Dale fact-checks Trump's CPAC speech    04:04   - Source:CNN    DeSantis and his foreign policy views are still a work in progressIn his new book “The Courage to be Free,” published last week, the Florida governor doesn’t mention Ukraine. But he does criticize the mantra laid out by President George W. Bush in his second inaugural address – that “the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the liberty in other lands.” DeSantis writes that this “messianic impulse—that the US had both the right and the obligation to promote democracy, by force, if necessary, around the world — was grounded in Wilsonian moralism, not in a clear-eyed view of American interests.”  This perspective seems incompatible with Biden’s characterization of the US’ support for Ukraine as part of a vital national interest to protect democracy.  Marco Bello/Reuters/FILEDeSantis agenda -- and potential campaign platform -- in the spotlight as Florida lawmakers return to workBut DeSantis is tapping into a familiar seam of opinion.  The sense among many voters that Bush overreached and led Americans into disastrous years-long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was not just a motivating force that helped the rise of Trump’s populist nationalism in the Republican Party. President Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 2008 warning that he was against “dumb wars.”  There is some reluctance to get involved in foreign wars again among American voters on the right and left. A group of Democratic members of Congress, for example, last year called for negotiations to end the war, despite the lack of indications that Putin has any willingness to withdraw his troops. But they were criticized by their colleagues for such a move.  And Iraq and Afghanistan are not a clean analogy for Ukraine – whatever Republican candidates might say – since Biden has scrupulously avoided the involvement of any US forces, as he seeks to head off a dangerous direct clash with nuclear-armed Moscow.  Biden’s need to shore up public support for an extended commitment to Ukraine was one reason why he went to Ukraine to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion.  “When united, Americans of all political backgrounds decided that they would step up. The American people know it matters. Unchecked aggression is a threat to all of us,” Biden told Zelensky in Kyiv.  “You remind us that freedom is priceless; it’s worth fighting for for as long as it takes. And that’s how long we’re going to be with you, Mr. President: for as long as it takes.”  But with the battle on the edge of Europe not looking like it will end any time soon, Biden may have to make that case on the debate stage with a Republican nominee next year – which suggests the clock maybe ticking for Ukraine.

A logo of Europol, European Union's law enforcement agency, is pictured at its headquarters building on June 24, 2020 in The Hague, Netherlands.Yuriko Nakao/Getty ImagesCNN      With the help of the FBI, German and Ukrainian police last week searched the properties of two suspected “core members” of a global cybercrime gang that has cost US victims tens of millions of dollars, European officials said Monday.  German police officers raided a German citizen’s house, while Ukrainian police searched properties in the capital Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv, European Union law enforcement agency Europol said.  The news shows how US and European officials’ hunt for ransomware gangs continues despite the upheavals caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine – two countries where many alleged ransomware operatives are based. Moscow generally refuses to extradite hackers wanted in the US and Europe, while the war has caused some Ukrainian hackers to flee the country.   Ransomware is malicious software that locks computers, typically so that hackers can demand payment. While labeling ransomware a national security threat, the Biden administration has invested heavily in trying to arrest and sanction ransomware operators.   The law enforcement sting announced Monday targeted a crime group whose ransomware has reportedly been used in disruptive cyberattacks in 2020 on a German hospital and computer systems in Pennsylvania’s Delaware County.   The hack forced the German hospital, in the city of Düsseldorf, to reroute an ambulance containing a critically ill patient. The patient later died, but German prosecutors ultimately did not hold the ransomware gang responsible for the death.   The type of ransomware used by the hackers, known as DoppelPaymer, has “negatively impacted the provision of healthcare, emergency and education services to citizens worldwide,” the FBI said in a 2020 advisory to the US industry.  Europol and police in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia credited the FBI for helping in in sting. It was not immediately clear what role the bureau played. CNN has requested comment from the FBI.   German police on Monday also announced arrest warrants for three alleged DoppelPaymer operatives who appear to be from Russia. One of the people, Igor Olegovich Turashev, was indicted in the Western District of Pennsylvania in 2019 on hacking wire and bank fraud charges and is wanted by the FBI.

A Belgian F-16 jet fighter takes part in the NATO Air Nuclear drill ""Steadfast Noon"" on October 18, 2022. Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      The US is working with Ukrainian pilots in the United States to determine how long it would take to train them to fly F-16 fighter jets, three sources briefed on the matter told CNN.  Two Ukrainian pilots are currently at a military base in the US having their skills tested in flight simulators to see how much time they would need to learn to fly various US military aircraft, including F-16s.  A US military official told reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the Middle East that the Ukrainian pilots were in Tucson, Arizona, for “a familiarization event” that he described as a “routine activity as part of our military-to-military dialogue with Ukraine.”   “The familiarization event is essentially a discussion between the Air Force personnel and an observation of how the US Air Force operates,” the official said.  “This event allows us to better help Ukrainian pilots become more effective pilots and better advise them on how to develop their own capabilities. The pilots will not be flying any platforms during this event but they will be using a simulator during portions of their visit.”  The official added that “there are no updates to provide regarding F-16s to Ukraine” and there are no immediate plans to increase the number of Ukrainian pilots in the US.  While there is no indication at this time that flight training is underway, the step suggests the US has not completely closed the door on providing F-16s.

The evaluation of the Ukrainian pilots is being conducted by the 162nd Fighter Wing, part of the Arizona Air National Guard which specializes in training on F-16 fighter jets, two US officials said Monday.  The 162nd Fighter Wing, which flies F-16 fighter jets, is based at Tucson International Airport, and a crucial part of its mission is training international aircrews on the fourth-generation aircraft. According to the Wing’s website, it has trained pilots from 25 countries which currently operate the F-16 and describes itself as the “face of the USAF to the world.”  One of the officials told CNN that 10 more Ukrainian pilots may come to the US for the same evaluation and assessment.   Ukraine has been pushing for the US to provide fighter jets and top Ukrainian officials have escalated their public lobbying campaign in recent days, arguing that they need the planes to defend against Russian missile and drone attacks.  But that push has been met with skepticism by US and allied officials, who say the jets would be impractical because they require considerable training and Russia has extensive anti-aircraft systems that could easily shoot them down.  When previously asked if the US would be providing F-16s to Ukraine, President Joe Biden responded with a flat “no.”   Early on in the war, the US also believed that supplying Ukraine with new fighter jets would risk an escalation between NATO and Russia.  In an interview with ABC News in February, Biden said that Ukraine “doesn’t need F-16s now,” despite repeated public pleas from Ukrainian officials and mounting pressure from congressional Republicans.

Could fighter jets be next?US and European officials have previously told CNN that F-16 fighter jets were impractical in this situation.  Germany last week ruled out fighter jet deliveries to Ukraine completely while UK government officials echoed the sentiment and said that they believed it was not practical to send jets into Ukraine.   Dutch and Polish leaders also appeared reluctant when asked about sending F-16 fighter jets.   On Tuesday, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told the House Armed Services Committee that it would take 18 months to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s and argued training pilots for that amount of time would be  prohibitively expensive.   “It’s just hard for me to tell any member of Congress or the American people that the best use of that dollar spent right now is on F-16s,” Kahl said in the hearing.CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and Oren Liebermann contributed reporting.

Historically, both countries had committed to non-alignment with NATO as a way of avoiding provoking Moscow. The invasion of Ukraine changed that.   Both Finland and Sweden – along with the vast majority of NATO allies – would like to see the countries formally join the alliance at a NATO summit on July 11. However, a significant hurdle stands in the way of this becoming a reality: Turkey has yet to give the plan its formal and official blessing.   Turkey is not the only nation blocking the move: Hungary has also failed to ratify the Nordics’ accession which further muddies the waters. However, right now getting Turkey on side is considered the priority.   Unfortunately for the pro-NATO gang, Western officials are increasingly pessimistic that Turkey will budge.  Officially, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan objects to Sweden and Finland’s membership on what he claims are security grounds. Turkey claims that both countries, though particularly Sweden, are harboring militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a designated terror group in Turkey, Sweden, the United States and Europe. Erdogan says he would like these individuals to be extradited; Sweden has made clear this won’t happen.   NATO diplomats are split on whether they think Turkey will budge before the July summit. Central to both schools of thought is this year’s Turkish election, perceived as the biggest political threat Erdogan has faced in years.   NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg meets Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers in July 2022. One NATO diplomat told CNN it's likely that Finland breaks from Sweden and goes for membership alone.Yves Herman/Reuters“The image he has created of a strongman who gets results for the Turkish people has been shattered,” explains Gonul Tol of the Middle East Institute’s Turkey program. “There is a lot of anti-West and anti-Kurd sentiment in Turkey at the moment. This is a good topic for him to bang his drum and a dramatic U-turn would only make him look weaker.”  Tol believes there are other reasons that Erdogan doesn’t want to upset Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.   “Russia has been a lifeline economically for Turkey after other nations imposed sanctions for their activities in Syria, their cooperation militarily with Russia and other hostile activity,” Tol explains. “Without Russian money, Erdogan would not have been able to raise wages or provide financial support to students. He is now promising mass rebuilding, post-earthquake. So Russia is still an attractive partner for Erdogan.”   Like many Western officials, Tol believes the Turkish claims about Sweden and Finland harboring terrorists provide perfect cover for Erdogan not to engage at a politically inconvenient time on the NATO question.  While nothing may come from the talks due between the three parties on Thursday, a conversation is taking place about how much political capital Erdogan might have to spend after the election, should he win.   First, the optimists.   This group includes Sweden, Finland and some of the states that border Russia or used to live under the Soviet sphere. They believe that Turkey, which benefits hugely from being part of NATO, will ultimately do what is in its best interest and drop objections.  For this to happen, officials are bracing for Turkey to make more realistic demands than the handing over of individuals it deems to be terrorists, such as the lifting of sanctions or the US allowing Turkey to buy the fighter jets that the country badly needs to keep its air force up to date.‘Going for membership alone’Ultimately, the optimists believe there is a compromise that vastly favors NATO. The alliance, Sweden and Finland have made their case and NATO has an open-door policy for any country wanting to join. Sweden and Finland have more than met the criteria, so not joining makes a mockery of the alliance – an alliance that Turkey benefits from being a member. One NATO official told CNN that they assumed Erdogan would wait for the summit before conceding so that he can bask in the “praise of all his Western allies.”   The far larger group among officials who spoke with CNN are pessimists. They think the chances of Erdogan shifting his position before July 11 are as good as zero and are already thinking beyond that summit.   “I think it’s increasingly likely that Finland breaks from Sweden and goes for membership alone,” one NATO diplomat told CNN.   Other members of the alliance still see a real prospect of both countries being blocked and are considering how best NATO can handle such a scenario.   Multiple NATO officials and diplomats told CNN that the danger here is Turkey’s block feeding the Kremlin narrative that the West and NATO are divided. The alliance’s job at that point will be to make clear that even if they are not members, Finland and Sweden are now effectively in lockstep with NATO. They might not be members, but they are as close partners as it’s possible to be – and they are not neutral any more.   Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is considered to be the EU leader closest to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Sputnik/Getty ImagesEven if Turkey can be squared off, there is the separate, albeit less complicated issue of Hungary.   Prime Minister Viktor Orban has publicly indicated he is not opposed to the Nordic nations joining, but keeps finding ways to stall a decision becoming official.   There are a few reasons Orban would want to drag his feet. Finland and Sweden have both criticized Hungary for its rule of law record. He addressed this in a recent interview, asking how “can anyone want to be our ally in a military system while they’re shamelessly spreading lies about Hungary?”   Orban is considered to be the EU leader closest to Putin. Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian Member of the European Parliament, describes Orban’s blocking of the Sweden and Finland bids as “quite simply, another favor to Vladimir Putin.” She believes that Orban, who has been accused of drifting towards autocratic leadership, has “invested over a decade to copy his policies and build up a Putinist model,” and that any perceived NATO victory over Putin “puts his whole regime in jeopardy.”  It is possible that Orban is hanging on in order to get concessions from other EU member states, where Hungary has been accused of violating all manner of EU laws. The result has been withholding of EU funds and scorn from the bloc. While NATO and the EU are separate entities, they share many members and it is plausible that bilateral diplomacy could see some give-and-take between Hungary and its EU counterparts.   For all Orban’s foot-dragging, though, it is widely assumed that if Turkey can be squared off, Hungary will drop its opposition to Finland and Sweden joining NATO.   The irony isn’t lost on many that one of the main reasons Putin gave for invading Ukraine was to put a stop to what he claimed was NATO expansion. The fact that his aggression might have pushed a historically unaligned country into NATO is still seen by most in the West as a huge own goal by the Kremlin.  Until an agreement is reached, however, the future of the alliance remains somewhat up in the air. Finland and Sweden have effectively picked a side since the start of the Ukraine conflict. It seems unlikely that they will return to a position of neutrality if the war were to suddenly end.   The risk for NATO and the broader Western alliance comes if they fail to join the alliance at all and the Kremlin can use it for propaganda purposes. If that happens, even if the war suddenly ends, the narrative of a divided West will continue to be the drum that NATO’s opponents can bang.    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Ukrainian defenses in and around the eastern city of Bakhmut are being squeezed by a combination of intense artillery, mortar fire, and airstrikes and a substantial commitment of ground forces, both Russian regulars and fighters of the Wagner private military company.   If and when Bakhmut falls, it may be tempting to ask whether Russian forces are improving, learning from the catalog of mistakes they have made so far in this conflict and finally exploiting their superiority in numbers and firepower.   The answer: probably not.    Mick Ryan, a former Australian general and author of the WarInTheFuture newsletter, says “the Ukrainian Armed Forces might decide that they have achieved all they can by remaining in their defensive locations around Bakhmut, and that force preservation for the battles that follow is more important.”   But a Ukrainian withdrawal does not equal disaster if carried out in an orderly way. “It should be treated as a routine tactic rather than a harbinger of disaster,” Ryan says.   The Ukrainians have used Bakhmut to inflict massive losses on the attacking force: by some estimates at a ratio of 7:1. There comes a moment when it is smarter to withdraw than suffer growing losses and the damaging blow to morale of seeing the surrender of hundreds and maybe thousands of surrounded Ukrainian soldiers.    For the Ukrainians judging that moment is critical.   But for the Russians, taking Bakhmut would not alter the fundamental shortcomings in their campaign.  Barrage fire  The battle for Bakhmut does suggest to some extent the Russians are changing their way of warfare, or at least trying to do so.   They still rely on massive barrages of indirect fire (artillery and howitzers, rockets, aerial bombardment) to pulverize defensive positions. This was the tactic in the cities of Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk last year. In short: leave nothing standing that can be defended.   To recall the words of the Stalin-era Marshal Georgy Zhukov, “The longer the battle lasts the more force we’ll have to use.”   But such persistent fire demands an efficient logistics chain. Russian forces still struggle on that count.

REUTERS/Alex BabenkoAlex Babenko/ReutersRussian fighters are edging into the city of Bakhmut. Here's what you need to knowFor sure, the end game in Mariupol and other cities taken last year ultimately involved men advancing street by street. But they were rarely Russian regulars, more often Chechen units, militia from the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk Republics, and small numbers of Wagner operatives.    And frequently they were moving into territory already abandoned.   The campaign to take Soledar in January and now nearby Bakhmut has been out of the same playbook but with one notable and gruesome exception: the waves of infantry recruited by Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group sent to flood Ukrainian defenses.   Prigozhin has acted unilaterally to shame the Russian military and burnish his own reputation. Wagner fighters taken prisoner by the Ukrainians told CNN they had next to no coordination with regular Russian forces, except for artillery support, as they were sent forward in their hundreds and thousands into the Ukrainian line of fire.   Prigozhin bragged last week that if Wagner left Bakhmut, the front would fall.    The Russians have inflicted massive fire on Bakhmut and destroyed much of the city, from which 90% of the population has fled.CNNThere are also signs that the Russians have used more infantry in their unsuccessful efforts to advance into Vuhledar, again with heavy losses.   It’s as if the Russians are bolting on rather than integrating a new dimension to their battle order: overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with wave after wave of cannon fodder – and accept casualty rates of up to 80% in the process.   Such a devastating percentage of casualties is unsustainable along front lines extending thousands of kilometers. To some analysts, such losses mean “the conditions are already present for a large-scale Russian military mutiny.”   Bakhmut has become an obsession for the Russians in the absence of progress elsewhere, far beyond any strategic rationale. Anxious that Prigozhin was taking the bouquets while it was taking the brickbats, the Russian Defense Ministry started pouring more forces into the area.    But the focus on Bakhmut may have come at a cost to Russian operations elsewhere. Rather than a triumph of Russian generalship, the grinding campaign to take Bakhmut, first attacked some 10 months ago, illustrates the desperate need for a “win” – any win – regardless of the broader battlefield.    That may explain why Ukrainian forces have been ordered to hold the line. Volodymyr Nazarenko, a deputy commander in the National Guard of Ukraine, said last week the Russians “take no account of their losses in trying to take the city by assault. The task of our forces in Bakhmut is to inflict as many losses on the enemy as possible. Every meter of Ukrainian land costs hundreds of lives to the enemy.”   Ukrainian servicemen fire a 105mm Howitzer towards Russian positions near the city of Bakhmut, on March 4, 2023.Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty ImagesUkrainian service members ride atop of a tank outside  Bakhmut, on March 4, 2023. Oleksandr Ratushniak/Reuters    ‘Battlefield leadership attrition’Russia’s mobilization last autumn, recruiting some 300,000 men into uniform, provided a pool of foot soldiers and helped reconstitute units that had suffered heavy losses. At the same time, Prigozhin was scouring Russian prisons and converting his Wagner forces into the shock troops of the campaign.   Ukrainian commanders knew they would soon face another onslaught.     But according to the Modern War Institute at West Point, “Russia has been unable to prove it can effectively integrate new forces into damaged formations or build cohesive teams from ad hoc groupings of scattered unit remnants.”     Russia is now “attempting to fight a costly, prolonged conflict with a pickup team of replacements while suffering from severe battlefield leadership attrition,” the Institute assesses.   But there are more systemic issues.    The Ukraine conflict has seen Russian forces gradually trying to move away from reliance on Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs), combined arms formations that have proved ill-equipped for the Ukrainian conflict. Their Achilles heel: a lack of infantry and reconnaissance.   The lack of each within BTGs in the advance toward Kyiv a year ago was one of the reasons the campaign stuttered and failed. Russian forces were vulnerable to ambush.    That vulnerability has been aggravated by an ingrained culture that values obedience over initiative.   In the words of a recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations, “The inadequate training and incompetence of Russian military personnel – combined with the strict hierarchies in which they operated, which left officers incapable of acting on their own initiative – meant that they were unable to quickly coordinate advances deep into enemy territory.”   As Rob Johnson wrote in the US Army War College Quarterly: “Basic battle skills (such as alertness, logistics management, and moving tactically across the terrain to avoid casualties) were substandard, and evidence suggests a significant lack of discipline.”   Such deficiencies are not cured overnight. And retooling formations and structures in the midst of fighting a war is not ideal, but even less so when there is a shortage of competent mid-level commanders. The loss of colonels and lieutenant colonels adds to Russian troubles.

But even if the Russian flag is raised over the ruins of Bakhmut, it may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory.   As Mick Ryan writes: “If the Russians do capture Bakhmut, they are seizing rubble. It is a town with minimal strategic importance, with almost no remaining infrastructure to support an occupying force. That the Russians have invested so much in its capture speaks volumes about their poor strategy in this war.”   On top of that, they have exhausted men and materiel that might have been badly needed as and when the Ukrainians eye counteroffensives in the months to come.

In the past few months alone, Japan has pledged to double defense spending and acquire long-range weapons from the US; South Korea has acknowledged that stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential to its security; the Philippines has announced new US base access rights and is talking about joint patrols of the South China Sea with Australia, Japan and the United States.  Those might be the biggest initiatives, but they are far from the only events that have left China increasingly isolated in its own backyard as it refuses to condemn the invasion of a sovereign country by its partner in Moscow while keeping military pressure on the self-ruled island of Taiwan.  Analysts say all these things would have likely happened without the war in Ukraine, but the war, and China’s backing of Russia, has helped grease the skids to get these projects done.  Take the situation of Japan, a country limited in its post-World War II constitution to “self-defense” forces. Now it’s going to buy long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US, weapons that could strike well inside China.  “I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a major defense conference in Singapore last summer.  In December, Kishida followed that up with a plan to double Tokyo’s defense spending while acquiring weapons with ranges well outside Japanese territory.

Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty Image/File“The Japanese people have certainly taken notice of the situation in Ukraine, and it has made them feel more vulnerable as a nation,” said John Bradford, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratman School of International Studies in Singapore.  The nation that Japan feels particularly vulnerable to is China.  The People’s Liberation Army has been growing and modernizing its forces for years. On Sunday, Beijing announced  its military budget for 2023, which will increase 7.2%. It marked the first time in the past decade that the military’s budget growth rate has increased for three consecutive years.  “The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board, develop new military strategic guidance, devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and make well-coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang said in a government work report.  China’s ruling Communist Party has for years been pressuring Taiwan. It sees the island as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and Chinese leader Xi has repeatedly refused to rule out the use of force in “reunifying” it with the Chinese mainland.  There’s worry that China may one day treat Taiwan as Russia has treated Ukraine.  Leaders in Tokyo have said peace across the Taiwan Strait is essential to Japan’s security. That’s really nothing new, but the urgency in Japan is.  “Japan has been strengthening its defense posture for years. The Ukraine situation made the key element of Kishida’s new National Security Strategy, the expected next steps in this strengthening, politically easier,” Bradford said.  In this handout image provided by the South Korean Defense Ministry, the US aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and South Korean warships seen during a US-South Korea combined naval exercise on September 29.South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty ImagesIn the current climate, the leadership in South Korea is watching Taiwan through a similar lens.  “Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and it’s indispensable for security and prosperity of the region as a whole,” Foreign Minister Park Jin told CNN recently.  There’s worry in Seoul that if US forces are drawn into any conflict with China over Taiwan, South Korea will look vulnerable in the eyes of Kim Jong Un in nuclear-armed North Korea.  That’s led to calls for South Korea to be more reliant on its own self-defense, including some calling for it to acquire its own nuclear weapons.   Meanwhile, Seoul and Tokyo are working more closely together on defense matters, including joint naval exercises with the US.  South Korea is also seeing increasing demands for the weapons it produces, like tanks, howitzers and fighter jets.  South Korea, the United States and Japan held a joint missile defense drill at the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula on February 22. South Korean Defence MinistryIt signed a mulitibillion-dollar deal with Poland, Ukraine’s neighbor to the West and part of the US-led NATO alliance, for all of those items. And it is selling them in the region as well.   In the past month, Korea Aerospace Industries has announced it will sell 18 of its FA-50 light fighter jets to Malaysia.  Another operator of those FA-50s is the Philippines. Manila is also a customer for Korean-made warships and offshore patrol vessels.   And the web of cooperation gets even more intricate.   The Philippines is in talks with the US, Australia and Japan for joint patrols in the South China Sea, where China occupies islands that the Philippines also claims.   And Manila last month agreed to give Washington increased access to military facilities in the archipelago.  China may have been its own biggest detractor when it comes to the Philippines, regardless of what it was doing about the Ukraine war, analysts said.  Former President Rodrigo Duterte was not a fan of Washington and looked for ways to work with Bejing. But China never really showed any appreciation for that and his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has shown himself eager to work with the US and its allies, the analysts said.  “It is difficult for the new Marcos administration to justify accommodating Beijing’s policy preferences when previous attempts at doing so by the previous government were not reciprocated,” said Jeffrey Ordaniel, director of maritime security at the Pacific Forum and an assistant professor at Tokyo International University.  “Beijing’s continued bullying, like we saw in the case of the China Coast Guard blinding Philippines Coast Guard sailors with a laser (recently), has only helped to make the case for a stronger alliance” with Washington, said Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  A photo released by the Philippine Coast Guard is alleged to show a Chinese coast guard ship aiming a laser at a Philippine vessel earlier this year.Philippine Coast GuardChina’s pressure on the Philippines has repercussions on the opposite side of the South China Sea, analysts said.  “Singapore and Vietnam have become even more open to greater US footprints in the region. They don’t want China to dominate Southeast Asia,” Ordaniel said.  But the Ukraine war has not been helpful in one key American partnership in the Indo-Pacific, the informal Quad alliance linking the US, Japan, Australia and India, according to analysts.  India, unlike the other three members, has not condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.  “When the US, Australia, and Japan tried to condemn Russia through a joint statement, India refused…. India claimed that the Quad only tackles Indo-Pacific challenges, and since Russia isn’t in the region, this topic cannot be broached,” said Derek Grossman, senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.  But he said that split in the Quad doesn’t really distract from its focus.   “The Quad is all about how to deal with China,” Grossman said.

Less than 10 miles down the road, they encountered a group of Russian troops.  The soldiers started shooting, then dragged Arina and her 9-year-old sister Valeria out of the back seat. Arina was wounded and put into one car; Valeria was ushered into another.  Valeria was taken to a nearby village, where locals found her standing by the road. Denys and Anna, the girls’ parents, were discovered shot dead in their car.    But March 3, 2022, was the last time anyone saw Arina. She’s one of 345 Ukrainian children who have disappeared since Russia launched its full-scale war on Ukraine last February, according to official Ukrainian statistics.  The Ukrainian government says many of the missing children have been forcibly taken to Russia. The Russian government doesn’t deny taking Ukrainian children – in fact, it says it’s “saving” them.  Arina’s aunt, Oksana Yatsiuk, told CNN the family has been searching for the girl with deep brown eyes and braces ever since she disappeared. Arina is good at drawing and loves make-up and traveling, her aunt said.  “She had big dreams, but the ‘Russian liberators’ decided everything for her. When we find her, we will carry on with her plans,” she said.  Arina Yatsiuk has not been seen since March 3 last year.courtesy Oksana YatsyukThe family said they believe the girl, who is now 16, is still alive and “held captive” in Russia.    “I sent official letters to all of the medical facilities, to the Ministry of Health in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine and the official answer I received is that she has not been registered anywhere,” Yatsiuk told CNN in a phone interview.  Yatsiuk, who is based in Poland, said she believes Arina had no documents on her when she went missing, which is perhaps why she hasn’t been officially registered anywhere.    “I received an official reply that Arina was not recorded crossing the border,” she said.  The family has been combing through social media groups, reaching out to groups of displaced people and working with volunteers in Russia and Belarus.  Yatsiuk said Arina’s DNA is also regularly checked against the national registers. “She is not on the official lists of dead,” she said.  A Russian volunteer who is helping with the search said they believe Arina was taken to a medical facility in Russia and has remained in the country ever since.    The volunteer, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because their involvement in the search could threaten their safety, said there have been no new leads on the case since the fall.‘War crime’ witnessArina’s disappearance still haunts Marina Lypovetska, the head of projects at Magnolia, a Ukrainian NGO which specializes in cases of missing children.    “She is a witness of war crime. If her younger sister didn’t understand that her parents were killed, I suppose that she understood, she herself was wounded and is also a victim of a war crime,” Lypovetska told CNN in an interview at Magnolia’s office in Kyiv.  Marina Lypovetska is the head of projects at Magnolia, a Ukrainian NGO which specializes in cases of missing children.Ivana Kottasova/CNNMagnolia has received more than 2,600 requests from families and friends of missing children since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, more than the total number of calls it got over the previous 20 years.  Its 18 employees work round the clock. They are in touch with the families of missing children, offering psychological and legal help. The group is also conducting its own searches using open-source intelligence techniques, public appeals and social media sleuthing to gather information.  Most of the calls coming in are about children from Ukraine’s occupied territories or areas hit by heavy fighting.    “Before the war, most cases were runaways, but now, most are directly connected to military actions,” Lypovetska said, adding that in the early days of the war, the majority of calls were from desperate families who had lost contact with loved ones in occupied areas.  But a few weeks into the conflict, Magnolia started receiving more calls about children who have been separated from their families during attacks or went missing during evacuations, she said.    And it soon became obvious that some of these children had been sent to Russia.  Employees of Magnolia, a Ukrainian NGO which specializes in cases of missing children, seek to reunite them with their families.Ivana Kottasova/CNN    Public boastsUnder international agreements, including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the deportation of a civilian population is considered a war crime and forcible transfers of children of one group to another group amount to genocide.   The United Nations’ refugee agency said in January that Russia’s actions were violating fundamental principles of child protection, Reuters reported.  But Russia has been brazenly open about its actions.    Over the past year, numerous Russian officials have publicly boasted about bringing Ukrainian children into the country. According to their statements, hundreds of children from occupied areas have been deported to far-flung places in Russia, where some have been promptly adopted by local families and given citizenship.  A small group of children described by officials as having been rescued from the Donbas was paraded in front of tens of thousands of people during a rally in Moscow last month. The children were encouraged to hug a uniformed man whom one of the girls referred to as “Uncle Yuri” who “saved” them from Mariupol.  CNN has asked the office of Russia’s Commissioner for Children’s Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, for comment on the allegations. It received a generic acknowledgement of receipt, but no reply.  Video Ad FeedbackRussia 'using children as an instrument of war,' warns head of child advocacy group    12:21   - Source:CNNRussian officials and pro-Russian separatists began deporting Ukrainian children across the border to Russia days before Moscow launched its attack on Ukraine. The leaders of the Russian-backed, self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) in eastern Ukraine ordered mass evacuations of civilians to Russia on February 18.  According to Russian officials, the evacuation included children living in orphanages and boarding schools in the two separatist-controlled areas.    Volodymyr Sahaidak, the director of a boarding school in Stepanivka, a settlement outside of Kherson, has first-hand experience of Russia’s efforts to take away children. The school was home to orphans and children whose families weren’t able to care for them, as well as children from families in difficult socio-economic circumstances.  When Russian troops rolled into the southern Ukrainian city in early March 2022, Sahaidak decided he needed to hide his wards from the invaders.    “My biggest fear was that children would be taken to Russia, because I’ve seen what was happening in Donetsk and Luhansk regions during these eight years of war,” he told CNN in a phone interview.  “I’ve seen children being taken to Russia. So I was worried they would be taken and brainwashed to ‘defend’ Russia.”  He said that children who had relatives able to take care of them were sent away, while those who didn’t were taken in by the staff of the school.

Evgeniy Maloletka/AP/FileWhy the US is accusing Russia of crimes against humanity and what that means Sahaidak said the school was repeatedly raided by Russian troops and officials in early June.  “They took all the personal files, they took all the hard drives, broke all the monitors, all the CCTV cameras, and took all the Ukrainian history books and a few others that they did not like,” he said.    While he managed to protect the 52 children he had under his guardianship, all between the ages of three and 18 years, he said a separate group of children that had been evacuated to the school from the Mykolaiv region was taken away by Russian troops.    Sahaidak told CNN he managed to reach the head of the Mykolaiv school, who told him the group had been taken – against her will – to the Black Sea town of Anapa in Russia. According to Sahaidak, volunteers later helped the group to escape to Georgia. As of February, the children were still there, he said.Russia’s ‘rescued orphan’ claims disputedThe exact number of unaccompanied children who have been taken to Russia is unclear.  A spokesperson for Ukraine’s children’s rights commissioner, Daria Herasymchuk, told CNN that as of February 23, 2023, at least 16,221 children had been forcibly deported. However, the spokesperson added, that number includes only the children Ukrainian officials know about. Many more may be in Russia without anyone being aware of their presence.  More than 700 attacks on Ukraine's health care system documented during Russia's invasion in 2022Report: Nearly one in every 10 hospitals in Ukraine have been damaged by attacks since Russia's invasionUkrainian Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin said last week that Ukraine managed to secure the return of 307 children so far. “To do more, we need the help of the international community,” he said during a meeting with the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatović.  Russian officials have not responded to CNN’s questions about the number of children brought to Russia by people other than family members. Statements issued throughout the year make it clear the numbers go into the thousands.    According to statements from Russian regional officials, 400 children were sent to a facility in Rostov-on-Don, near the border between Russia and occupied Ukraine, in the first days of the war.  In April, the office of Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights, said that around 600 children from Ukraine had been placed in orphanages in Kursk and Nizhny Novgorod before being sent to live with families in the Moscow region.

Commissioner for Children's Rights under the President of the Russian FederationAs of mid-October, 800 children from Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area were living in the Moscow region, many with families, according to the Moscow regional governor.  Some of the children have ended up thousands of miles and several time zones away from Ukraine. According to Lvova-Belova’s office, Ukrainian kids have been sent to live in institutions and with foster families in 19 different Russian regions, including Novosibirsk, Omsk and Tyumen regions in Siberia and Murmansk in the Arctic.  Lvova-Belova herself adopted a 15-year-old boy from Mariupol, according to official statements.    A Kremlin readout of her meeting with Vladimir Putin in February revealed she told the Russian President: “Now I know what it means to be a mother of a child from Donbas – it is a difficult job but we love each other, that is for sure.”  In the same meeting, she said that placing Donbas children into Russian families was the “favorite part of my work.”    Russian officials often claim that the children put up for adoption are orphans rescued from war-torn regions. But according to Ukrainian authorities, many of the children have relatives who want to take care of them in Ukraine.

It's been the longest year of their livesLast fall, a desperate father from Kharkiv called the Magnolia NGO. The man’s wife had been killed while attempting to flee the fighting and the whereabouts of their 10-year-old son were unknown – until the father saw a video of his boy on a Russian TV program.  “And in the video they showed the boy’s face and said, ‘we saved this poor Ukrainian boy, an orphan, and we took him to a hospital in Luhansk,’” Lypovetska, from Magnolia, told CNN.  It took more than two months to reunite the father with his son, Lypovetska said. The NGO and Ukrainian authorities engaged a network of Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, along with lawyers, all trying to confirm the boy’s location and negotiate his return.     The boy was eventually found in Russian-occupied Luhansk. His father was unable to travel to the region because he wouldn’t be allowed to leave the area and would be at risk of being forced to fight for the separatists, so it was up to the boy’s grandmothers to make the long, treacherous journey.  “It’s impossible to go to Luhansk from Ukraine, so they had to make a big circle through Russia, cross the border, then back through Russia to Europe, and only then back to Ukraine,” Lypovetska said.Russification programRussia is open about its efforts to “Russify” the children brought from Ukraine.  A new Russian law that came into effect in May has made it much easier to give Russian citizenship to Ukrainians – as long as they were “orphans, children left without parental care, or incapacitated persons.”    But the Russification efforts go well beyond citizenship ceremonies.    Russian officials often talk about Ukrainian children receiving Russian citizenship and taking part in nationalistic activities, camps and excursions, as well as being sent to “patriotic” schools.  The Office of the Children's ombudsman for the Moscow Region released this image alongside a statement that announced 14 children from Donbas received Russian citizenship in July. CNN obscured portions of this image to protect the identity of the children. Commisiner for Children's Rights in the Moscow RegionIn one statement, officials announced that some children from eastern Ukraine had been dispatched to a St. Petersburg boarding school for the Cadet Corps of the Investigative Committee, an institution educating the next generation of Russian state officials.   Several children from the separatist-run regions in eastern Ukraine were also among a group of almost 200 youngsters who attended a “military-patriotic camp for difficult teenagers” in Chechnya over the summer. The program was organized by Lvova-Belova and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, according to official statements issued by their offices.    Photographs from the camp published by Chechen state media show teenage boys dressed in white hoodies printed with pictures of Kadyrov and Putin, waving Russian and separatist flags.    According to Lvova-Belova, more than 1,000 teenagers from the DPR, LPR, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – the four regions illegally annexed by Putin in September – attended special “rehabilitation programs” that included trips to famous Russian sights and meetings with celebrities.   The US State Department-backed Conflict Observatory, run by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, released a report last month detailing what it said was a network of at least 43 camps across Russia where thousands of Ukrainian children have been held since the war started last February.  Video Ad FeedbackThese Ukrainian parents are fighting to get their children back from Russian camps    03:47   - Source:CNNCNN obtained a voice message sent by 16-year-old Serhiy to his mother in Ukraine from one of the camps. In it, he said: “My friends and I were forced to sing the Russian anthem, but we didn’t sing it. We got no reaction because they didn’t see us. We have to sing the Russian anthem during every day’s morning exercises.” CNN is not disclosing his last name for security reasons.  One of the authors of the Yale report, Nathaniel Raymond, said the “primary purpose of the camps appears to be political re-education.”    “At least 32 of the facilities identified [in the report] appear to be engaged in systematic re-education efforts that expose children from Ukraine to Russia-centric academic, cultural, patriotic, and in two cases, specifically military education,” he said at a news conference.    The report found that found that more than 6,000 children – ranging in age from mere months old to 17 – have been in Russian custody at some point during the course of the year-long war, although the “total number of children is not known and is likely significantly higher than 6,000.”  Arina Yatsiuk's family believe she was taken to Russia and remains there still.courtesy Oksana YatsyukFriday marked the first anniversary of Arina Yatsiuk’s disappearance.  Her younger sister Valeria has been formally adopted by her aunt and uncle. Oksana Yatsiuk, the aunt, told CNN the little girl was receiving psychological support and was slowly coming to terms with the horrible reality that her parents were murdered.  “She keeps asking about her sister, worries about her and is waiting for her,” she said.    “We all believe she is alive and we will soon find her. We are considering all options, including that she might have already been adopted,” she added.  The pain of the Yatsiuk family is a stark contrast with the propaganda repeatedly pushed out by Russian officials, including Lvova-Belova.  At one public event, the ombudsman described feeling “patriotic” about Russian families adopting children from the occupied regions of Ukraine.    “Isn’t this unity, isn’t this the patriotic feeling when there is no such thing as other people’s children and that all of them are ours now?” she said, according to an official statement.

As he embarks on another campaign for the presidency, Trump delivered another CPAC doozy Saturday night.  Trump’s lengthy address to the right-wing gathering in Maryland was filled with wildly inaccurate claims about his own presidency, Joe Biden’s presidency, foreign affairs, crime, elections and other subjects.  Here is a fact check of 23 of the false claims Trump made. (And that’s far from the total.)Crime and civil unrestCrime in ManhattanWhile Trump criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has been investigating Trump’s company, he claimed that “killings are taking place at a number like nobody’s ever seen, right in Manhattan.”   Facts First: It isn’t even close to true that Manhattan is experiencing a number of killings that nobody has ever seen. The region classified by the New York Police Department as Manhattan North had 43 reported murders in 2022; that region had 379 reported murders in 1990 and 306 murders in 1993. The Manhattan South region had 35 reported murders in 2022 versus 124 reported murders in 1990 and 86 murders in 1993. New York City as a whole is also nowhere near record homicide levels; the city had 438 reported murders in 2022 versus 2,262 in 1990 and 1,927 in 1993.Manhattan North had just eight reported murders this year through February 19, while Manhattan South had one. The city as a whole had 49 reported murders.  The National Guard and MinnesotaTalking about rioting amid racial justice protests after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, Trump claimed he had been ready to send in the National Guard in Seattle, then added, “We saved Minneapolis. The thing is, we’re not supposed to do that. Because it’s up to the governor, the Democrat governor. They never want any help. They don’t mind – it’s almost like they don’t mind to have their cities and states destroyed. There’s something wrong with these people.”   Facts First: This is a reversal of reality. Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard during the 2020 unrest; Walz first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. Walz’s office told CNN in 2020 that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats. Trump has repeatedly made the false claim that he was the one who sent the Guard to Minneapolis. You can read a longer fact check, from 2020, here.  Trump’s executive order on monumentsTrump boasted that he had taken effective action as president to stop the destruction of statues and memorials. He claimed: “I passed and signed an executive order. Anybody that does that gets 10 years in jail, with no negotiation – it’s not ’10’ but it turns into three months.” He added: “But we passed it. It was a very old law, and we found it – one of my very good legal people along with [adviser] Stephen Miller, they found it. They said, ‘Sir, I don’t know if you want to try and bring this back.’ I said. ‘I do.’”    Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He did not create a mandatory 10-year sentence for people who damage monuments. In fact, his 2020 executive order did not mandate any increase in sentences.Rather, the executive order simply directed the attorney general to “prioritize” investigations and prosecutions of monument-destruction cases and declared that it is federal policy to prosecute such cases to the fullest extent permitted under existing law, including an existing law that allowed a sentence of up to 10 years in prison for willfully damaging federal property. The executive order did nothing to force judges to impose a 10-year sentence.  Vandalism in PortlandTrump claimed, “How’s Portland doing? They don’t even have storefronts anymore. Everything’s two-by-four’s because they get burned down every week.”   Facts First: This is a major exaggeration. Portland obviously still has hundreds of active storefronts, though it has struggled with downtown commercial vacancies for various reasons, and some businesses are sometimes vandalized by protesters. Trump has for years exaggerated the extent of property damage from protest vandalism in Portland.    Russia, Ukraine and NATORussian expansionism Boasting of his foreign policy record, Trump claimed, “I was also the only president where Russia didn’t take over a country during my term.”   Facts First: While it’s true that Russia didn’t take over a country during Trump’s term, it’s not true that he was the only US president under whom Russia didn’t take over a country. “Totally false,” Michael Khodarkovsky, a Loyola University Chicago history professor who is an expert on Russian imperialism, said in an email. “If by Russia he means the current Russian Federation that existed since 1991, then the best example is Clinton, 1992-98. During this time Russia fought a war in Chechnya, but Chechnya was not a country but one of Russia’s regions.” Khodarkovsky added, “If by Russia he means the USSR, as people often do, then from 1945, when the USSR occupied much of Eastern Europe until 1979, when USSR invaded Afghanistan, Moscow did not take over any new country. It only sent forces into countries it had taken over in 1945 (Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968).”  NATO fundingTrump said while talking about NATO funding: “And I told delinquent foreign nations – they were delinquent, they weren’t paying their bills – that if they wanted our protection, they had to pay up, and they had to pay up now.”   Facts First: It’s not true that NATO countries weren’t paying “bills” until Trump came along or that they were “delinquent” in the sense of failing to pay bills – as numerous fact-checkers pointed out when Trump repeatedly used such language during his presidency. NATO members haven’t been failing to pay their share of the organization’s common budget to run the organization. And while it’s true that most NATO countries were not (and still are not) meeting NATO’s target of each country spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, that 2% figure is what NATO calls a “guideline”;  it is not some sort of binding contract, and it does not create liabilities. An official NATO recommitment to the 2% guideline in 2014 merely said that members not currently at that level would “aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade.”NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg did credit Trump for securing increases in European NATO members’ defense spending, but it’s worth noting that those countries’ spending had also increased in the last two years of the Obama administration following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and the recommitment that year to the 2% guideline. NATO notes on its website that 2022 was “the eighth consecutive year of rising defence spending across European Allies and Canada.”  NATO’s existenceBoasting of how he had secured additional funding for NATO from countries, Trump claimed, “Actually, NATO wouldn’t even exist if I didn’t get them to pay up.”    Facts First: This is nonsense. There was never any indication that NATO, created in 1949, would have ceased to exist in the early 2020s without additional funding from some members. The alliance was stable even with many members not meeting the alliance’s guideline of having members spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.   We don’t often fact-check claims about what might have happened in an alternative scenario, but this Trump claim has no basis in reality. “The quote doesn’t make sense, obviously,” said Erwan Lagadec, research professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs and an expert on NATO.    Lagadec noted that NATO has had no trouble getting allies to cover the roughly $3 billion in annual “direct” funding for the organization, which is “peanuts” to this group of countries. And he said that the only NATO member that had given “any sign” in recent years that it was thinking about leaving the alliance “was … the US, under Trump.” Lagadec added that the US leaving the alliance is one scenario that could realistically kill it, but that clearly wasn’t what Trump was talking about in his remarks on spending levels.  James Goldgeier, an American University professor of international relations and Brookings Institution visiting fellow, said in an email: “NATO was founded in 1949, so it seems very clear that Donald Trump had nothing to do with its existence. In fact, the worry was that he would pull the US out of NATO, as his national security adviser warned he would do if he had been reelected.”  The cost of NATO’s headquartersTrump mocked NATO’s headquarters, saying, “They spent – an office building that cost $3 billion. It’s like a skyscraper in Manhattan laid on its side. It’s one of the longest buildings I’ve ever seen. And I said, ‘You should have – instead of spending $3 billion, you should have spent $500 million building the greatest bunker you’ve ever seen. Because Russia didn’t – wouldn’t even need an airplane attack. One tank one shot through that beautiful glass building and it’s gone.’”   Facts First: NATO did spend a lot of money on its headquarters in Belgium, but Trump’s “$3 billion” figure is a major exaggeration. When Trump used the same inaccurate figure in early 2020, NATO told CNN that the headquarters was actually constructed for a sum under the approved budget of about $1.18 billion euro, which is about $1.3 billion at exchange rates as of Sunday morning.The Pulitzer PrizeTrump made his usual argument that The Washington Post and The New York Times should not have won a prestigious journalism award, a 2018 Pulitzer Prize, for their reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 election and its connections to Trump’s team. He then said, “And they were exactly wrong. And now they’ve even admitted that it was a hoax. It was a total hoax, and they got the prize.”   Facts First: The Times and Post have not made any sort of “hoax” admission. “The claim is completely false,” Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email on Sunday.Stadtlander continued: “When our Pulitzer Prize shared with The Washington Post was challenged by the former President, the award was upheld by the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review. The board stated that ‘no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.’ The Times’s reporting was also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.”  The Post referred CNN to that same July statement from the Pulitzer Prize Board.   Awareness of the Nord Stream 2 pipelineTrump claimed of his opposition to Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany: “Nord Stream 2 – Nobody ever heard of it … right? Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along. I started talking about Nord Stream 2. I had to go call it ‘the pipeline’ because nobody knew what I was talking about.”   Facts First: This is standard Trump hyperbole; it’s just not true that “nobody” had heard of Nord Stream 2 before he began discussing it. Nord Stream 2 was a regular subject of media, government and diplomatic discussion before Trump took office. In fact, Biden publicly criticized it as vice president in 2016. Trump may well have generated increased US awareness to the controversial project, but “nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along” isn’t true.Trump and Nord Stream 2Trump claimed, “I got along very well with Putin even though I’m the one that ended his pipeline. Remember they said, ‘Trump is giving a lot to Russia.’ Really? Putin actually said to me, ‘If you’re my friend, I’d hate like hell to see you as my enemy.’ Because I ended the pipeline, right? Do you remember? Nord Stream 2.” He continued, “I ended it. It was dead.”   Facts First: Trump did not kill Nord Stream 2. While he did approve sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around an estimated 90% complete – and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump’s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters.The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine early last year. The pipeline was damaged later in the year in what has been described as an act of sabotage.   The Obama administration and UkraineTrump claimed that while he provided lethal assistance to Ukraine, the Obama administration “didn’t want to get involved” and merely “supplied the bedsheets.” He said, “Do you remember? They supplied the bedsheets. And maybe even some pillows from [pillow businessman] Mike [Lindell], who’s sitting right over here. … But they supplied the bedsheets.”   Facts First: This is inaccurate. While it’s true that the Obama administration declined to provide weapons to Ukraine, it provided more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 that involved far more than bedsheets. The aid included counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, armored Humvees, tactical drones, night vision devices and medical supplies.Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutorTrump claimed that Biden, as vice president, held back a billion dollars from Ukraine until the country fired a prosecutor who was “after Hunter” and a company that was paying him. Trump was referring to Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, who sat on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.   Facts First: This is baseless. There has never been any evidence that Hunter Biden was under investigation by the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had been widely faulted by Ukrainian anti-corruption activists and European countries for failing to investigate corruption. A former Ukrainian deputy prosecutor and a top anti-corruption activist have both said the Burisma-related investigation was dormant at the time Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin.Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post in 2019: “Shokin was not investigating. He didn’t want to investigate Burisma. And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.” In addition, Shokin’s successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg in 2019: “Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws – at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.”  Biden, as vice president, was carrying out the policy of the US and its allies, not pursuing his own agenda, in threatening to withhold a billion-dollar US loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government did not sack Shokin. CNN fact-checked Trump’s claims on this subject at length in 2019. The economyTrump and job creationPromising to save Americans’ jobs if he is elected again, Trump claimed, “We had the greatest job history of any president ever.”   Facts First: This is false. The US lost about 2.7 million jobs during Trump’s presidency, the worst overall jobs record for any president. The net loss was largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but even Trump’s pre-pandemic jobs record – about 6.7 million jobs added – was far from the greatest of any president ever. The economy added more than 11.5 million jobs in the first term of Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.Tariffs on ChinaTrump repeated a trade claim he made frequently during his presidency. Speaking of China, he said he “charged them” with tariffs that had the effect of “bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury from China. Thank you very much, China.” He claimed that he did this even though “no other president had gotten even 10 cents – not one president got anything from them.”   Facts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.” Also, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing most of the cost of the tariffs.The trade deficit with ChinaTrump went on to repeat a false claim he made more than 100 times as president – that the US used to have a trade deficit with China of more than $500 billion. He claimed it was “five-, six-, seven-hundred billion dollars a year.”  Facts First: The US has never had a $500 billion, $600 billion or $700 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US runs a surplus with China. The pre-Trump record for a goods deficit with China was about $367 billion in 2015. The goods deficit hit a new record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years.    ElectionsTrump and the 2020 election Trump said people claim they want to run against him even though, he claimed, he won the 2020 election. He said, “I won the second election, OK, won it by a lot. You know, when they say, when they say Biden won, the smart people know that didn’t [happen].”   Facts First: This is Trump’s regular lie. He lost the 2020 election to Biden fair and square, 306 to 232 in the Electoral College. Biden earned more than 7 million more votes than Trump did. Democrats and electionsTrump said Democrats are only good at “disinformation” and “cheating on elections.”   Facts First: This is nonsense. There is just no basis for a broad claim that Democrats are election cheaters. Election fraud and voter fraud are exceedingly rare in US elections, though such crimes are occasionally committed by officials and supporters of both parties. (We’ll ignore Trump’s subjective claim about “disinformation.”)    War and peaceThe liberation of the ISIS caliphate Trump repeated his familiar story about how he had supposedly liberated the “caliphate” of terror group ISIS in “three weeks.” This time, he said, “In fact, with the ISIS caliphate, a certain general said it could only be done in three years, ‘and probably it can’t be done at all, sir.’ And I did it in three weeks. I went over to Iraq, met a great general. ‘Sir, I can do it in three weeks.’ You’ve heard that story. ‘I can do it in three weeks, sir.’ ‘How are you going to do that?’ They explained it. I did it in three weeks. I was told it couldn’t be done at all, that it would take at least three years. Did it in three weeks. Knocked out 100% of the ISIS caliphate.”   Facts First: Trump’s claim of eliminating the ISIS caliphate in “three weeks” isn’t true; the ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq, in late December 2018, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past, when he said “I did it”: Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016.IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.  Military equipment left in Afghanistan Trump claimed, as he has before, that the US left behind $85 billion worth of military equipment when it withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021. He said of the leader of the Taliban: “Now he’s got $85 billion worth of our equipment that I bought – $85 billion.” He added later: “The thing that nobody ever talks about, we lost 13 [soldiers], we lost $85 billion worth of the greatest military equipment in the world.”   Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.  The Afghanistan withdrawal and the F-16 Trump claimed that the Taliban acquired F-16 fighter planes because of the US withdrawal, saying: “They feared the F-16s. And now they own them. Think of it.”   Facts First: This is false. F-16s were not among the equipment abandoned upon the US withdrawal and the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, since the Afghan armed forces did not fly F-16s.ImmigrationThe border wall Trump claimed that he had kept his promise to complete a wall on the border with Mexico: “As you know, I built hundreds of miles of wall and completed that task as promised. And then I began to add even more in areas that seemed to be allowing a lot of people to come in.”   Facts First: It’s not true that Trump “completed” the border wall. According to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not been completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280 miles left to go, about 74 miles were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”  Latin America and deportations Trump told his familiar story about how, until he was president, the US was unable to deport MS-13 gang members to other countries, “especially” Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because those countries “didn’t want them.”   Facts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back migrants being deported from the US during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.In 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.  For the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported that Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US.

It won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary Feature. And is streaming on HBO Max, which is owned by CNN’s parent company.CNN      Russia’s most famous dissident and critic of Vladimir Putin, Alexey Navalny, remains locked in solitary confinement at the maximum-security IK-6 penal colony at Melekhovo, in ailing health, and according to those closest to him, subjected to torture intended to break his spirit.   Despite Navalny’s suffering, Odessa Rae, one of the producers of Oscar-nominated documentary and CNN Film “Navalny,” has no doubt that the opposition politician is still finding ways to delight in his own dark – and disarming – sense of humor.   “I’m sure it’s his humor that is keeping his spirit alive,” she told CNN Opinion. “He has a particular penchant for dark humor, so he’s probably finding lots of great content in prison.”   From left, Yulia Navalnaya, Alexey Navalny and Odessa Rae during the filming of the master interviews.Lorena MuhsamRae should know. In late 2020, she spent months filming with Navalny and his family in Germany’s Black Forest while he recovered from a near lethal dose of the deadly nerve agent Novichok delivered by an elite Russian intelligence unit (which the Kremlin denies).   Now, as fears for Navalny’s health grow, and a growing chorus of Russian lawyers and medical professionals call for an end to his “blatant torture” in prison, Rae answered questions from CNN Opinion’s Sheena McKenzie and Jane Carr, revealing new details about Navalny’s confinement – and reflected on his enduring source of strength.    CNN: You spent many months with Navalny in Germany while he was recovering from poisoning – what are your memories of that time and what did it reveal about him?   Odessa Rae: I will never forget the first time I met Alexey Navalny. Daniel Roher (director of “Navalny”), Christo Grozev (investigative journalist) and I drove into the night, through the Black Forest after a few weeks of trying to arrange a meeting with Navalny.    Our car was packed with camera gear. We had high hopes, but no official agreement to film had been made. Upon arriving, we were immediately charmed by Navalny’s welcoming energy, warm smile and the ease at which he initiates conversation. We easily let go of any intimidating preconceptions we had about him.   Geared up and ready for the first drive into the Black Forest to meet Alexey Navalny.Odessa RaeOnce we started filming, we would ask, “Alexey, can we come film you running? Brushing your teeth? Waking up?” He sometimes thought our requests sounded absurd, but he was always willing and accepted us with a good spirit. We would end long days with his favorite local food: the Doner Kebab.   The security situation that he lived in was very clear from the first meeting. The team was very cautious about who they let in. Christo vouched for us but we had to earn their trust. We offered, “two months in, if you don’t like it, we will quit and give you all the footage.”   They agreed to start that way, but it came with endless questions and intensive background checks. They even wanted to look at our bank accounts to make sure we were not being paid by any government entity. Navalny lived in hiding.   I think we were accepted by his team for a few reasons. At the time we were just independent filmmakers, we were not yet associated with any major production company. We had no outside funding. We arrived in the Black Forest with the cost of the rental gear piled onto my credit card. We were willing to put our all into this film. We adapted to his security needs. No one knew where we were or what we were doing. All emails ceased, communication was done through encrypted messaging.   From left, Daniel Roher, Odessa Rae, Christo Grozev, Alexey Navalny and George Alburov gather around a table the day of the phone call.Niki WaltlIt took a lot of gymnastics to keep the footage safe. We spent long hours in the car, in winter conditions driving to various locations. Often we were met with Covid restrictions.  My passwords became a three-step process with an external security key, which is how I continue to live. We traded stability for the privilege to spend unforgettable time getting to know an extraordinary human being.   CNN: Please describe Navalny’s current prison conditions and the physical and mental toll.   Rae: Navalny is in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison. He has been there for the most part since last August. The main reason he is in solitary confinement is because of his vocal anti-war activism from his jail cell. He is one of Russia’s loudest voices against the war in Ukraine. He even uses his court time to protest the war.  They are torturing him in prison. They weaponize other inmates by putting an inmate in the infirmary until they become ill (contract an illness from other patients in the infirmary) and then put the sick inmate in Navalny’s cell.   MOSCOW, RUSSIA - MAY,24 (RUSSIA OUT) Russian opposition politician, anti-corruption campaigner and founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), Alexey Navalny is seen on the screen during his legal appeal against his nine-year prison sentence, in Moscow's City Court, on May 24, 2022, in Moscow, Russia. Appeal of Kremlin critic Navalny was rejected by the court on Tuesday. (Photo by Contributor/Getty Images)Getty Imagesvideo    Navalny's daughter: Russia is slowly killing my fatherRecently when Navalny became ill, almost certainly having contracted an illness from one of the weaponized inmates, even with a high fever, they restricted his water intake to only three glasses per day.   They introduced another inmate into the cell next to him who screams for hours and hours at night. He is not able to lie down during the day as his bed is chained up to the wall from 5 AM to 9 PM. They deprive him of family visits and of basic necessities like winter boots. He has lost close to 7 kilos (approximately 15 pounds) in the last couple months and has been repeatedly denied medical treatment.   CNN: Navalny recently tweeted: “I laugh at least thrice a day, even when I’m all alone in the cell.” How does he maintain his sense of humor amid the darkness? What gives him that strength?  Rae: Navalny has both an insatiable curiosity and a terrific sense of humor – both of which I’m sure serve him well in prison. We actually talked about this one day while driving him to a shoot.    We had a rigorous schedule, with many sleepless nights. Often I had the privilege of picking him up. I found Navalny to be a very open conversationalist.  If he didn’t know something he would not hide it. On one of our drives he set out to pick my brain about life in Hollywood. “Tell me about the #MeToo movement.” Or: “Explain film production to me.”   From left, Christo Grozev, Yulia Navalny, Alexey Navalny, Dasha Navalny, Daniel Roher, Georgy Alburov, Kira Yarmysh, Odessa Rae and Maria Pevchikh eat and unwind after 20 hours of filming the phone call and the CNN release.Niki WaltlOn another long drive, we discussed his earlier experiences in prison. He told me that one of the greatest things he learned was to appreciate the small things, the tiny little things that we don’t normally think about on a daily basis – like brushing your teeth whenever you want, or touching a loved ones face, or a warm shower.    I can just imagine him applying this skill now in prison, looking at a prison guard and finding something entertaining about him or her, the sound of a bell, or receiving a funny letter. He has a way of connecting to people through humor. It was the way he often brought lightness to a tense situation.   We had a group chat that was filled with jokes. There was lots of banter about Canadian hockey versus Russian hockey. I’m sure it’s his humor that is keeping his spirit alive. He has a particular penchant for dark humor so he’s probably finding lots of great content in prison.   CNN: You’re working on another documentary about Ukraine. Can you tell us more about the project and what you’ve seen in Ukraine?  Rae: This project in Ukraine would not have been possible without my producing partners on the Navalny film, Diane Becker, Shane Boris and Melanie Miller. They came on board and helped me carry the weight of Navalny. They were the team that Daniel and I needed. We became close like a family, highlighting for me the necessity of teamwork.   At this time, the Ukraine documentary is still in the filming process. I’ve been following some individuals, operating within Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government, who have been involved in crucial negotiations. What I have seen is horrific. And always at the back of my mind is the awareness that I’m allowed the privilege of safety as soon as I fly back home. My concern is for the Ukrainian people during this time, and I hope to tell their story.

I have witnessed people responding to the daily brutal and senseless attacks on critical infrastructure with courage, creativity and resilience. But at the same time there are strange undercurrents of life just going on.   From my last trip, at the end of December, I have a poignant memory of sitting in my friend’s donut shop, Ponchyk Boy. (They often make themed donuts that address the war in a comical way.)  We were unable to make a cup of tea because the electricity was out, the air raid sirens were blaring, much of the city was dark. The generators come on where they can, but people just keep going or, they sit in the dark - sometimes with a candle. Even when they have no heat the spirit lives strong.  CNN: Even locked in solitary confinement and in poor health, how much of a threat is Navalny to Russian President Vladimir Putin?    Rae: Navalny continues to be a threat to Putin’s autocracy. Even from maximum security prison, he is one of the most vocal anti-war activists in Russia today.  His Anti-Corruption Foundation is constantly criticizing Putin’s leadership, ruling practices and the war. Navalny is fighting for a better, more prosperous, fair and democratic Russia.   Last week he posted a 15-point plan for post-war Russia. This plan presents a way forward. In a sense it is a manifesto. You can find this piece on his social media. It is like a breath of fresh air. This plan lays out Navalny’s political views and an alternate, more reasonable way forward for the Russian people and for the region. It is a plan that demonstrates respect for its neighbors and for Russian citizens. His very existence symbolizes hope.

Dasha Navalnaya appears on CNNCNNEditor’s Note: The CNN film “Navalny” premiered in April 2022 and won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary Feature. It is streaming on HBO Max, which is owned by CNN’s parent company.CNN      Dasha Navalnaya, the daughter of jailed Russian dissident Alexey Navalny, has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine and to release her father and political prisoners in the country, in an extensive interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday.  “We will not stop fighting” until both of those goals are achieved, Navalnaya said.  Her father Navalny – an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and its war in Ukraine – is currently serving a nine-year jail term at a maximum-security prison east of Moscow after being convicted of large-scale fraud by a Russian court last year.   He was poisoned with nerve agent Novichok in 2020, an attack several Western officials and Navalny himself openly blamed on the Kremlin. Russia has denied any involvement.  After several months in Germany recovering from the poisoning, Navalny returned to Moscow, where he was immediately arrested for violating probation terms imposed from a 2014 embezzlement case that he said was politically motivated.   He was initially sentenced to two-and-a-half years, and then later given nine years over separate allegations that he stole from his anti-corruption foundation.  Navalny, who previously ran for political office in Russia, has long been a thorn in the side of the Kremlin.   Dasha said the “main goal” of her father’s work and anti-corruption foundation “is for Russia to become a free state, to have open elections, to have freedom of press, freedom of speech, and just you know, to have the opportunity to become a part of the normal Western democratized community.”   She described the experience of growing up in a family watched closely by the government, telling Burnett that she and her brother made a game out of trying to evade spies on public transport in Russia.  “We would look around the train and then start chatting with the guy who had the worst camouflage outfit and the black cap and the weird strappy bag on the side, and we would jump out – not out of the train but out of the the subway car,” she said.   But Navalnaya also voiced escalating concern about her father’s prison conditions now, saying that her family has had limited access to Navalny and that his attorneys are able to see him only “through a guarded veil.”   “So we can’t really know for sure his health circumstance and he hasn’t seen his family in over half a year,” she said. “I haven’t seen him in person in over a year and it’s quite concerning considering his health is getting worse and worse.”  Dasha Navalnaya speaks with CNN's Erin Burnett on March 3.CNNConcerns about Navalny’s health have persisted for months. Footage during his sentencing last year showed Navalny as a gaunt figure standing beside his lawyers in a room filled with security officials.   Navalny himself has tweeted about difficult conditions in confinement, saying in November that he had been isolated from other prisoners in what he described as a move designed to “shut me up.” Inmates in Russian penal colonies are typically housed in barracks rather than cells, according to a report by Poland-based think tank the Center for Eastern Studies (OSW).  The “real indescribable bestiality” of his incarceration, however, was limitations on visits with family, he said at the time.  Navalny’s poisoning and subsequent legal problems drew intense interest from the Russian public and abroad. Russia witnessed large-scale anti-government protests in towns and cities across the country after his arrest, with authorities detaining around 11,000 demonstrators within a few weeks.  In June last year, Navalny was transferred from a penal colony in Pokrov to a maximum-security prison in Melekhovo in Russia’s Vladimir region.   Throughout his incarceration, Navalny has nevertheless vociferously denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine via social media, advocating anti-war protests across the country as “the backbone of the movement against war and death.”   In a tweet thread about his prison conditions last year, he vowed to continue speaking out.   “So what’s my first duty? That’s right, to not be afraid and not shut up,” he wrote, urging others to do the same. “At every opportunity, campaign against the war, Putin and United Russia. Hugs to you all.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

And the members of Congress, former government officials and conservative personalities who spoke at the conference on Thursday and Friday made false claims about a variety of topics.  Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio uttered two false claims about President Joe Biden. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia repeated a debunked claim about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama used two inaccurate statistics as he lamented the state of the country. Former Trump White House official Steve Bannon repeated his regular lie about the 2020 election having been stolen from Trump, this time baselesly blaming Fox for Trump’s defeat.  Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida incorrectly said a former Obama administration official had encouraged people to harass Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina inaccurately claimed Biden had laughed at a grieving mother and inaccurately insinuated that the FBI tipped off the media to its search of former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence. Two other speakers, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and former Trump administration official Sebastian Gorka, inflated the number of deaths from fentanyl.   And that’s not all. Here is a fact check of 13 false claims from the conference, which continues on Saturday.Zelensky’s remark about American ‘sons and daughters’ Marjorie Taylor Greene said the Republican Party has a duty to protect children. Listing supposed threats to children, she said, “Now whether it’s like Zelensky saying he wants our sons and daughters to go die in Ukraine…” Later in her speech, she said, “I will look at a camera and directly tell Zelensky: you’d better leave your hands off of our sons and daughters, because they’re not dying over there.”   Facts First: Greene’s claim is false. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn’t say he wants American sons and daughters to fight or die for Ukraine. The false claim, which was debunked by CNN and others earlier in the week, is based on a viral video that clipped Zelensky’s comments out of context. Video Ad Feedback19-second video of Zelensky goes viral. See what was edited out    03:03   - Source:CNNIn reality, Zelensky predicted at a press conference in late February that if Ukraine loses the war against Russia because it does not receive sufficient support from elsewhere, Russia will proceed to enter North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries in the Baltics (a region made up of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that the US will be obligated to send troops to defend. Under the treaty that governs NATO, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and Zelensky didn’t say Americans should fight there.  Greene is one of the people who shared the out-of-context video on Twitter this week. You can read a full fact-check, with Zelensky’s complete quote, here. Fox and the 2020 electionRight-wing commentator and former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon criticized right-wing cable channel Fox at length for, he argued, being insufficiently supportive of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Among other things, Bannon claimed that, on the night of the election in November 2020, “Fox News illegitimately called it for the opposition and not Donald J. Trump, of which our nation has never recovered.” Later, he said Trump is running again after “having it stolen, in broad daylight, of which they [Fox] participate in.”   Facts First: This is nonsense. On election night in 2020, Fox accurately projected that Biden had won the state of Arizona. This projection did not change the outcome of the election; all of the votes are counted regardless of what media outlets have projected, and the counting showed that Biden won Arizona, and the election, fair and square. The 2020 election was not “stolen” from Trump. Video Ad FeedbackBannon has a harsh message for Fox News at CPAC    00:52   - Source:CNNFox, like other major media outlets, did not project that Biden had won the presidency until four days later. Fox personalities went on to repeatedly promote lies that the election was stolen from Trump – even as they privately dismissed and mocked these false claims, according to court filings from a voting technology company that is suing Fox for defamation. Biden’s attempted deportation pause Rep. Jim Jordan claimed that Biden, “on day one,” made “three key changes” to immigration policy. Jordan said one of those changes was this: “We’re not going to deport anyone who come.” He proceeded to argue that people knowing “we’re not going to get deported” was a reason they decided to migrate to the US under Biden.  Facts First: Jordan inaccurately described the 100-day deportation pause that Biden attempted to impose immediately after he took office on January 20, 2021. The policy did not say the US wouldn’t deport “anyone who comes.” It explicitly did not apply to anyone who arrived in the country after the end of October 2020, meaning people who arrived under the Biden administration or in the last months of the Trump administration could still be deported. Biden did say during the 2020 Democratic primary that “no one, no one will be deported at all” in his first 100 days as president. But Jordan claimed that this was the policy Biden actually implemented on his first day in office; Biden’s actual first-day policy was considerably narrower.  Biden’s attempted 100-day pause also did not apply to people who engaged in or were suspected of terrorism or espionage, were seen to pose a national security risk, had waived their right to remain in the US, or whom the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement determined the law required to be removed.   The pause was supposed to be in effect while the Department of Homeland Security conducted a review of immigration enforcement practices, but it was blocked by a federal judge shortly after it was announced.The media and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago Rep. Ralph Norman strongly suggested the FBI had tipped off the media to its August search of  Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Florida for government documents in the former president’s possession – while concealing its subsequent document searches of properties connected to Biden.  Norman said: “When I saw the raid at Mar-a-Lago – you know, the cameras, the FBI – and compare that to when they found Biden’s, all of the documents he had, where was the media, where was the FBI? They kept it quiet early on, didn’t let it out. The job of the next president is going to be getting rid of the insiders that are undermining this government, and you’ve gotta clean house.”   Facts First: Norman’s narrative is false. The FBI did not tip off the media to its search of Mar-a-Lago; CNN reported the next day that the search “happened so quietly, so secretly, that it wasn’t caught on camera at all.” Rather, media outlets belatedly sent cameras to Mar-a-Lago because Peter Schorsch, publisher of the website Florida Politics, learned of the search from non-FBI sources and tweeted about it either after it was over or as it was just concluding, and because Trump himself made a public statement less than 20 minutes later confirming that a search had occurred. Schorsch told CNN on Thursday: “I can, unequivocally, state that the FBI was not one of my two sources which alerted me to the raid.”Brian Stelter, then CNN’s chief media correspondent, wrote in his article the day after the search: “By the time local TV news cameras showed up outside the club, there was almost nothing to see. Websites used file photos of the Florida resort since there were no dramatic shots of the search.”  It’s true that the public didn’t find out until late January about the FBI’s November search of Biden’s former think tank office in Washington, which was conducted with the consent of Biden’s legal team. But the belated presence of journalists at Mar-a-Lago on the day of the Trump search in August is not evidence of a double standard.  And it’s worth noting that media cameras were on the scene when Biden’s beach home in Delaware was searched by the FBI in February. News outlets had set up a media “pool” to make sure any search there was recorded.Two-parent householdsSen. Tommy Tuberville, a former college and high school football coach, said, “Going into thousands of kids’ homes and talking to parents every year recruiting, half the kids in this country – I’m not talking about race, I’m just talking about – half the kids in this country have one or no parent. And it’s because of the attack on faith. People are losing faith because, for some reason, because the attack [on] God.”   Facts First: Tuberville’s claim that half of American children don’t have two parents is incorrect. Official figures from the Census Bureau show that, in 2021, about 70% of US children under the age of 18 lived with two parents and about 65% lived with two married parents.About 22% of children lived with only a mother, about 5% with only a father, and about 3% with no parent. But the Census Bureau has explained that even children who are listed as living with only one parent may have a second parent; children are listed as living with only one parent if, for example, one parent is deployed overseas with the military or if their divorced parents share custody of them.  It is true that the percentage of US children living in households with two parents has been declining for decades. Still, Tuberville’s statistic significantly exaggerated the current situation. His spokesperson told CNN on Thursday that the senator was speaking “anecdotally” from his personal experience meeting with families as a football coach.The literacy of high school graduatesTuberville claimed that today’s children are being “indoctrinated” in schools by “woke” ideology and critical race theory. He then said, “We don’t teach reading, writing and arithmetic anymore. You know, half the kids in this country, when they graduate – think about this: half the kids in this country, when they graduate, can’t read their diploma.”  Facts First: This is false. While many Americans do struggle with reading, there is no basis for the claim that “half” of high school graduates can’t read a basic document like a diploma. “Mr. Tuberville does not know what he’s talking about at all,” said Patricia Edwards, a Michigan State University professor of language and literacy who is a past president of the International Literacy Association and the Literacy Research Association. Edwards said there is “no evidence” to support Tuberville’s claim. She also said that people who can’t read at all are highly unlikely to finish high school and that “sometimes politicians embellish information.”Tuberville could have accurately said that a significant number of American teenagers and adults have reading trouble, though there is no apparent basis for connecting these struggles with supposed “woke” indoctrination. The organization ProLiteracy pointed CNN to 2017 data that found 23% of Americans age 16 to 65 have “low” literacy skills in English. That’s not “half,” as ProLiteracy pointed out, and it includes people who didn’t graduate from high school and people who are able to read basic text but struggle with more complex literacy tasks.  The Tuberville spokesperson said the senator was speaking informally after having been briefed on other statistics about Americans’ struggles with reading, like a report that half of adults can’t read a book written at an eighth-grade level.Biden’s speech on threats to democracyRep. Jim Jordan claimed of Biden: “The president of the United States stood in front of Independence Hall, called half the country fascists.”   Facts First: This is not true. Biden did not denounce even close to “half the country” in this 2022 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.  He made clear that he was speaking about a minority of Republicans.In the speech, in which he never used the word “fascists,” Biden warned that “MAGA Republicans” like Trump are “extreme,” “do not respect the Constitution” and “do not believe in the rule of law.” But he also emphasized that “not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans.” In other words, he made clear that he was talking about far less than half of Americans.   Trump earned fewer than 75 million votes in 2020 in a country of more than 258 million adults, so even a hypothetical criticism of every single Trump voter would not amount to criticism of “half the country.”The Biden administration, gas stoves and electric vehiclesRep. Scott Perry claimed that “average citizens need to just at some point be willing to acknowledge and accept that every single facet of the federal government is weaponized against every single one of us.” Perry said moments later, “The government doesn’t have the right to tell you that you can’t buy a gas stove but that you must buy an electric vehicle.”   Facts First: This is nonsense. The federal government has not told people that they can’t buy a gas stove or must buy an electric vehicle. The Biden administration has tried to encourage and incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles, but it has not tried to forbid the manufacture or purchase of traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. Biden has set a goal of electric vehicles making up half of all new vehicles sold in the US by 2030.  There was a January controversy about a Biden appointee to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, Richard Trumka Jr., saying that gas stoves pose a “hidden hazard,” as they emit air pollutants, and that “any option is on the table. Products that can’t be made safe can be banned.” But the commission as a whole has not shown support for a ban, and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a January press briefing: “The president does not support banning gas stoves. And the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is independent, is not banning gas stoves.” Biden’s laughRep. Ralph Norman claimed that Biden had just laughed at a mother who lost two sons to fentanyl.   “I don’t know whether y’all saw, I just saw it this morning: Biden laughing at the mother who had two sons – to die, and he’s basically laughing and saying the fentanyl came from the previous administration. Who cares where it came from? The fact is it’s here,” Norman said.   Facts First: Norman’s claim is false. Biden did not laugh at the mother who lost her sons to fentanyl, the anti-abortion activist Rebecca Kiessling; in a somber tone, he called her “a poor mother who lost two kids to fentanyl.” Rather, he proceeded to laugh about how Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had baselessly blamed the Biden administration for the young men’s deaths even though the tragedy happened in mid-2020, during the Trump administration. You can watch the video of Biden’s remarks here. Kiessling has demanded an apology from Biden. She is entitled to her criticism of Biden’s remarks and his chuckle – but the video clearly shows Norman was wrong when he claimed Biden was “laughing at the mother.”An exchange about Justice Brett Kavanaugh Rep. Kat Cammack told a story about the first hearing of the new Republican-led House select subcommittee on the supposed “weaponization” of the federal government. Cammack claimed she had asked a Democratic witness at this February hearing about his “incredibly vitriolic” Twitter feed in which, she claimed, he not only repeatedly criticized Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh but even went “so far as to encourage people to harass this Supreme Court justice.”   Facts First: This story is false. The witness Cammack questioned in this February exchange at the subcommittee, former Obama administration deputy assistant attorney general Elliot Williams, did not encourage people to harass Kavanaugh. In fact, it’s not even true that Cammack accused him at the February hearing of having encouraged people to harass Kavanaugh. Rather, at the hearing, she merely claimed that Williams had tweeted numerous critical tweets about Kavanaugh but had been “unusually quiet” on Twitter after an alleged assassination attempt against the justice. Clearly, not tweeting about the incident is not the same thing as encouraging harassment. Williams, now a CNN legal analyst (he appeared at the subcommittee hearing in his personal capacity), said in a Thursday email that he had “no idea” what Cammack was looking at on his innocuous Twitter feed. He said: “I used to prosecute violent crimes, and clerked for two federal judges. Any suggestion that I’ve ever encouraged harassment of anyone – and particularly any official of the United States – is insulting and not based in reality.”  Cammack’s spokesperson responded helpfully on Thursday to CNN’s initial queries about the story Cammack told at CPAC, explaining that she was referring to her February exchange with Williams. But the spokesperson stopped responding after CNN asked if Cammack was accurately describing this exchange with Williams and if they had any evidence of Williams actually having encouraged the harassment of Kavanaugh. The Trump-era economySen. John Kennedy of Louisiana boasted about the state of the country “when Republicans were in charge.” Among other claims about Trump’s tenure, he said that “in four years,” Republicans “delivered 3.5% unemployment” and “created 8 million new jobs.”   Facts First: This is inaccurate in two ways. First, the economic numbers for the full “four years” of Trump’s tenure are much worse than these numbers Kennedy cited; Kennedy was actually referring to Trump’s first three years while ignoring the fourth, which was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, there weren’t “8 million new jobs” created even in Trump’s first three years.Kennedy could have correctly said there was a 3.5% unemployment rate after three years of the Trump administration, but not after four. The unemployment rate skyrocketed early in Trump’s fourth year, on account of the pandemic, before coming down again, and it was 6.3% when Trump left office in early 2021. (It fell to 3.4% this January under Biden, better than in any month under Trump.)  And while the economy added about 6.7 million jobs under Trump before the pandemic-related crash of March and April 2020, that’s not the “8 million jobs” Kennedy claimed – and the economy ended up shedding millions of jobs in Trump’s fourth year. Over the full four years of Trump’s tenure, the economy netted a loss of about 2.7 million jobs.Unemployment under Trump Lara Trump, Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law and an adviser to his 2020 campaign, claimed that the last time a CPAC crowd was gathered at this venue in Maryland, in February 2020, “We had the lowest unemployment in American history.” After making other boasts about Donald Trump’s presidency, she said, “But how quickly it all changed.” She added, “Under Joe Biden, America is crumbling.”   Facts First: Lara Trump’s claim about February 2020 having “the lowest unemployment in American history” is false. The unemployment rate was 3.5% at the time – tied for the lowest since 1969, but not the all-time lowest on record, which was 2.5% in 1953. And while Lara Trump didn’t make an explicit claim about unemployment under Biden, it’s not true that things are worse today on this measure; again, the most recent unemployment rate, 3.4% for January 2023, is better than the rate at the time of CPAC’s 2020 conference or at any other time during Donald Trump’s presidency.     Fentanyl deaths Multiple speakers at CPAC decried the high number of fentanyl overdose deaths. But some of the speakers inflated that number while attacking Biden’s immigration policy.   Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official, claimed that “in the last 12 months in America, deaths by fentanyl poisoning totaled 110,000 Americans.” He blamed “Biden’s open border” for these deaths.   Rep. Scott Perry claimed: “Meanwhile over on this side of the border, where there isn’t anybody, they’re running this fentanyl in; it’s killing 100,000 Americans – over 100,000 Americans – a year.”   Facts First: It’s not true that there are more than 100,000 fentanyl deaths per year. That is the total number of deaths from all drug overdoses in the US; there were 106,699 such deaths in 2021. But the number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, primarily fentanyl, is smaller – 70,601 in 2021. Fentanyl-related overdoses are clearly a major problem for the country and by far the biggest single contributor to the broader overdose problem. Nonetheless, claims of “110,000” and “over 100,000” fentanyl deaths per year are significant exaggerations. And while the number of overdose deaths and fentanyl-related deaths increased under Biden in 2021, it was also troubling under Trump in 2020 – 91,799 total overdose deaths and 56,516 for synthetic opioids other than methadone.   It’s also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled in by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking past other parts of the border. Contrary to frequent Republican claims, the border is not “open”; border officers have seized thousands of pounds of fentanyl under Biden.

President Joe Biden speaks as he meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Friday, March 3, 2023. Susan Walsh/APCNN      A year ago, when German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last visited Washington, Russian forces had yet to cross the border into Ukraine and skepticism abounded at the dire warnings from the White House that an invasion was imminent.  Scholz returned Friday for meetings with President Joe Biden after a transformative 12 months that required Europe to dramatically rethink its own security and Germany to undergo its most significant shift in military and energy policy in decades.  “There’s been a lot of change since the last time you were here,” Biden said at the start of the Oval Office talks, which were expected to last about an hour.  Scholz concurred: “A lot’s happened since last year, we’ve got a lot to talk about,” he said.   Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has turned Scholz, who took office two months before Russia’s invasion, into a crisis leader, overseeing Europe’s largest economy and most powerful democracy during the worst violence on the continent since World War II.  And it has thrust him and Biden into one of the world’s most consequential relationships, sustained by shared opposition to Russia’s invasion but strained at moments over how to respond.  “You stepped up to provide critical military support. And I would argue, beyond the military support, the moral support you’ve given Ukrainians has been profound. Profound,” Biden told his counterpart in the Oval Office.  “I know it’s not been easy,” Biden said. “Very difficult for you.”  White House officials say over the past year, Biden has developed a solid relationship with Scholz, who succeeded longtime chancellor Angela Merkel at the end of 2021. They spoke by phone three times in January alone, and during Friday’s session at the White House they were expected to speak extensively one-on-one in the Oval Office.  The overwhelming topic of discussion was Ukraine, according to senior administration officials, including discussions the two men have each held recently with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is pressuring the West for more powerful weapons as he prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  “The overarching purpose of this meeting was a chance for the two leaders to be able to coordinate specifically on Ukraine,” a senior administration official said ahead of the visit.  They were expected to also touch on recent intelligence suggesting China is considering providing Russia with lethal aid, a step US officials fear could prolong the conflict, though China wasn’t a “driving focus” of the talks.  The White House also announced another round of military assistance for Ukraine on Friday, including ammunition for weapons systems that the Ukrainians already have. The package totaled around $400 million.  In inviting Scholz to the White House again, Biden hoped to fortify a leader who has endured a trying first year in office.  A year ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Germany supplying Ukraine with weapons like Howitzers, Stinger missile launchers and Leopard tanks to stave off Russian invaders. A largely pacifist outlook had dominated Berlin’s foreign policy in the decades following German violence in World War II.  But now, Germany is investing again in its military and sending increasingly advanced weaponry, though not at the pace Zelensky would like. Other critics say Scholz has failed to occupy a unifying role in Europe akin to Merkel, preferring to operate unilaterally instead of in conjunction with fellow leaders like Emmanuel Macron of France. And some US officials say Germany remains overly cautious compared to other Western allies.  Still, the so-called “Zeitenwende,” or turning point, that Scholz called for in the days following Russia’s invasion has been welcomed at the White House and reinforced by many of the steps he’s taken in the months since.  Germany’s decision in January to provide Ukraine with Leopard tanks is the latest example of the country overcoming its post-war hesitancy for foreign military intervention. The decision only came after diplomatic wrangling with the United States, who agreed to provide Ukraine with its own Abrams tanks, despite warnings from the Pentagon they wouldn’t be as useful on the battlefield.  There remains some dispute over how, exactly, the deal came about. After Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last weekend, “the Germans told the president that they would not be prepared to send those Leopards into the fight … until the president also agreed to send Abrams,” the German government insisted the decision to send tanks was arrived at jointly and without any demands from Berlin.  Either way, the result has been viewed positively by Biden’s aides, some of whom took a skeptical view of Scholz a year ago when he appeared reluctant to apply sanctions on Russia should it invade Ukraine or cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Scholz took both of those steps once the invasion began, despite the risk of Germany being cut off from one of its main energy suppliers.   For his part, Scholz could use Friday’s meeting to raise with Biden his ongoing discussions with other European leaders about providing security guarantees for Ukraine as a way to begin the process of negotiating an end to the war.  Fear are growing among US and European officials that the grinding conflict could turn into a bloody stalemate, with each side making only small gains while still refusing to come to the negotiating table.  Speaking to the German parliament before leaving for Washington, Scholz said Thursday that Germany and its Western allies were in talks with Kyiv over future security guarantees in preparation of a sustainable peace for Ukraine.  “Such security guarantees, however, come with the presumption that Ukraine successfully defends itself in this war,” Scholz said, emphasizing that Germany would continue to support Ukraine with weapons supplies.  Scholz went on to say that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was not currently open to negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.   “Is Putin even ready … to negotiate a just peace? Nothing suggests it at the moment,” Scholz said.

The remarks from the billionaire — who called for an end to Moscow’s war in Ukraine in the early days of the conflict last year — contrast with a more upbeat assessment of Russia’s economic fortunes by President Vladimir Putin last week. Putin praised the resilience of the country’s economy in the face of unprecedented Western sanctions imposed in the past year.   Russia’s economic output shrank 2.1% last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the government. The contraction was more limited than many economists initially predicted.   A mysterious fleet is helping Russia ship oil around the world. And it's growingBut cracks are starting to show — Russia is cutting oil production this month — and Western sanctions could escalate further. Ultimately, Russia’s economic prospects are contingent on what happens in Ukraine.   Foreign investors, especially from “friendly” countries, also have a big role to play, Deripaska said. Whether they will come depends on whether Russia can create the right conditions and make its markets attractive, he was quoted as saying.  In a bid to starve Russia of funds for its aggression, Western countries have announced more than 11,300 sanctions since the February 2022 invasion, and frozen some $300 billion of Russia’s foreign reserves.  But China has thrown the Kremlin an economic lifeline by buying Russian energy, replacing Western suppliers of machinery and base metals among other products, and providing an alternative to the US dollar.     Still, Moscow has a steep hill to climb to replace revenues lost as a result of sanctions, not least from exports. Data released Friday showed that the European Union’s imports from Russia fell by 51% in value between February and December last year. The bloc was one of the main trading partners for Russia before the invasion of Ukraine, with 38% of Russia’s exports going to the European Union in 2020.  The Russian government’s revenue plunged 35% in January compared with a year ago, while expenditures jumped 59%, leading to a budget deficit of about 1,761 billion rubles ($23.3 billion).   Deripaska made his fortune in the aluminum business during the chaotic scramble for assets following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2018, he was sanctioned by the United States, which noted that the oligarch “does not separate himself from the Russian state.” Last year, he was indicted for allegedly violating US sanctions.  Forbes estimates Deripaska’s current net worth at just under $3 billion.  — Anna Chernova contributed reporting.

Nobel Prize winner Ales Bialiatski is seen in the defendants' cage in the courtroom at the start of the hearing in Minsk on January 5, 2023. Vitaly Pivovarchik/BELTA/AFP/Getty Images/FILECNN      Belarusian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski was sentenced by a court in Minsk on Friday to 10 years in a maximum-security penal colony, Russia state news agency TASS reports. He was found guilty on the charge of smuggling, according to TASS.  Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya slammed the sentencing of Bialiatski and other activists in the same trial as “appalling.”   “We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice & free them,” she wrote on Twitter.  Germany called the 10-year prison term an attack by Minsk on civil society. On Twitter, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock slammed the charges and trial against Bialiatski and co-defendants Valentin Stefanovich and Vladimir Labkovich as a ”farce” adding they were being judged ”simply because of their years-long fight for the rights, dignity and freedom of people in Belarus.”  ”The Minsk regime is fighting civil society with violence and imprisonment,” Baerbock said, adding ”this is as much a daily disgrace as Lukashenko’s support for Putin’s war (in Ukraine).”  Baerbock urged Belarus to end political persecution and demanded the release of all of the more than 1,400 political prisoners.  Bialiatski, a pro-democracy activist, has documented human rights abuses in Belarus since the 1980s. He founded the organization Viasna, or Spring, in 1996 after a referendum that consolidated the authoritarian powers of president and close Russian ally, President Alexander Lukashenko.  The activist was arrested in 2020 amid widespread protests against Lukashenko’s regime.  Bialiatski won the Nobel Peace Prize for 2022 alongside human rights groups from Russia and Ukraine.  The new laureates were honored for “an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power” in their respective countries. “They have for many years promoted the right to criticize power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said at the time.  Belarusian opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya congratulated Bialiatski. “The prize is an important recognition for all Belarusians fighting for freedom & democracy,” she wrote in a tweet three years ago. “All political prisoners must be released without delay.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Video Ad FeedbackPutin accuses Ukraine of 'terrorist attack' in Russia. CNN investigates the claim    02:03   - Source:CNNCNN      Russian security officials claimed on Thursday that a small Ukrainian armed group had crossed the Russian border into the southern Bryansk region, allegations dismissed by Kyiv as a “classic deliberate provocation” by the Kremlin.  The Security Service of Russia (FSB) said in a statement via state media agency RIA Novosti on Thursday that the agency was carrying out operations following an “armed Ukrainian nationalists who violated the state border” in the district. President Vladimir Putin later described the incident as a terrorist attack, and a local official said two civilians were killed.  CNN cannot independently verify the Russian claims, and local media have not carried any images of the supposed incidents, any type of confrontation or an alleged raid reported by Russian authorities.  US and Ukrainian officials have in the past warned that Russia has planned so-called “false flag” attacks along Russia’s border with Ukraine as a pretext for military escalation, including Russian claims ahead of last year’s full-scale invasion that Ukraine was sending “saboteurs” over the Russian border.  The Bryansk region shares a border to its south with Ukraine, and to its west with Belarus, the close Russian ally nation that helped facilitate Putin’s invasion of Ukraine last year.   The governor of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, said Wednesday on his Telegram channel that in the village of Lyubechan, two civilians were killed and a 10-year-old child was injured. In the village of Sushany, also located in the Klimovsky district, Bogomaz said a residential building caught fire from a shell dropped from what he claimed was a Ukrainian drone, according to RIA Novosti.

REUTERS/Alex BabenkoAlex Babenko/ReutersRussian fighters are edging into the city of Bakhmut. Here's what you need to knowPutin canceled a planned trip to southern Russia due to the incident in Bryansk, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Thursday. While making remarks on the incident, Putin didn’t specify if the group had crossed the border from Ukraine, but blamed the attack on “neo-Nazis,” without giving additional details. He also promised to “put them away.”  “Today, [they] committed another terrorist act, penetrated the border area and opened fire on civilians,” Putin said during a televised meeting on Thursday. “They saw that civilians and children were sitting there, [in] an ordinary Niva (car). They opened fire on them.”  An adviser in Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky’s office, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the alleged raid was either a Russian provocation, or the work of local partisans taking a stand against the Kremlin, denying any Ukrainian involvement.  “Ukraine is not attacking,” Podolyak said. “This is either a provocation by the Russian side or Russian partisans who are beginning to dismantle the Putin regime. Because they still want to preserve some political chances for the post-war future of Russia, which will lose this war.”  Podolyak also said this type of operation was consistent with previous Russian provocations.   “This is classic Russia. It always goes for provocation, lies, it always creates information pretexts,” he said. “Ukraine does not attack Russian territory, does not send special reconnaissance groups there, does not kill people, especially civilians. Ukraine does not need this. This is not a strategic object and there is no point in going there.”  “Or it is something else,” he also said. “Either Russian partisans are actively starting to show their personality because they want to prove that a protest movement is also possible in Russia.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Video Ad FeedbackPutin critic arrested after appearing on CNN show    03:53   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      The Biden administration on Friday imposed sanctions on a number of Russian individuals connected to the arbitrary detention of Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent human rights advocate and Kremlin critic who has been jailed in Moscow for nearly a year after speaking out against the war in Ukraine in an interview with CNN.The United States has called for Kara-Murza’s “immediate and unconditional release.” However, Friday’s actions represent an long-awaited decision on imposing sanctions against Russia for his imprisonment.  Kara-Murza, who has survived two poisonings, has been incredibly critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s war in Ukraine, and he continues to speak out even as he is detained.   In March 2022, Kara-Murza spoke before the Arizona House of Representatives and spoke out against the war. In an April 2022 interview with CNN, he called Putin’s government “a regime of murderers.” He was arrested shortly thereafter for “failing to obey the orders of law enforcement,” according to his wife. “The Russian Government later brought additional politically motivated charges against him, and Kara-Murza currently faces the prospect of more than 30 years in prison,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Friday.Sanctions targetsThe Treasury Department on Friday imposed sanctions under an expansion of the Global Magnitsky Act, which targets serious human rights abusers. The sanctions come more than five months after the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called on the Biden administration to take action under that law.The sanctions target Elena Anatolievna Lenskaya, Andrei Andreevich Zadachin, and Danila Yurievich Mikheev.   Lenskaya “is a judge of the Basmannyy District Court in Moscow who oversaw Kara-Murza’s pre-trial detention hearing” and “ordered that Kara-Murza be held in pre-trial detention on charges based on his exercising the right to freedom of expression,” the Treasury Department said in a news release.  “Zadachin is a Special Investigator assigned to the Chief Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation. Zadachin ordered that a criminal case be initiated against Kara-Murza based on his speech before the Arizona House of Representatives. Zadachin requested that detention be ordered as a pre-trial restraint for Kara-Murza and defended this request in court,” the Treasury Department said.  Mikheev “served as an expert witness for the Russian government on the case against Kara-Murza, reviewing video of Kara-Murza’s speech and providing a report that served as part of the basis on which Lenskaya ordered Kara-Murza be held,” the agency said.  In a complementary action, the US State Department imposed its own visa sanctions on Lenskaya and Zadachin, blocking them and their immediate family members from entering the United States. The State Department additionally sanctioned three other Russian officials: Oleg Mikhailovich Sviridenko, Diana Igorevna Mishchenko, and Ilya Pavlovich Kozlov.  “Sviridenko is the Russian Deputy Minister of Justice who oversees the prosecution of criminal cases, including the criminal case to which Kara-Murza is subject. Mishchenko is the judge who issued the initial ruling approving Kara-Murza’s arrest and sentenced him to 15 days in jail. Kozlov is the judge who denied Kara-Murza’s appeal of Mishchenko’s administrative arrest ruling,” Blinken said in his statement.Continued opposition Even as he is imprisoned, Kara-Murza has continued to voice his opposition to Putin’s war in Ukraine. On Thursday, US Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter read aloud a handwritten letter from Kara-Murza, which was dated February 15.  “In short, since 24 February 2022 Vladimir Putin’s regime brought Russia as close as humanly possible to the reality once described by George Orwell – a reality in which ‘war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength,’” Kara-Murza wrote.   He wrote that “despite the censorship, the repression and the very threat of imprisonment, thousands of Russians have openly denounced Putin’s war on Ukraine.”  “Dozens of us are now imprisoned for it – journalists, lawyers, artists, priests, politicians, military officers; people of different backgrounds and different vocations who have refused to stay silent in the face of this atrocity, even at the cost of personal freedom,” he wrote.   “It is my hope that when the free world today thinks and speaks about Russia, it will remember not only the aggressors and war criminals in the Kremlin, but also those who are standing up to them,” Kara-Murza wrote. “Because we are all Russians, too.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Alex MurdaughAlex Murdaugh, the 54-year-old disgraced South Carolina attorney whose trial garnered national attention, was found guilty Thursday of murdering his wife and son. After more than a month of listening to dozens of witnesses, jurors took less than three hours to convict Murdaugh on all four counts that he was facing – two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon in the commission of a violent crime. Murdaugh kept a stony face when the verdicts were read while his only remaining son could be seen wiping tears from his eyes. The verdict came after a six-week trial revealed shocking details involving brutal gore, extensive financial wrongdoing and the defendant’s own lies. Murdaugh is scheduled to be sentenced this morning.2. Royal evictionPrince Harry and Meghan have been asked to vacate the residence gifted to them by the late Queen Elizabeth II. “We can confirm The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage,” their spokesperson told CNN. The statement followed a report in the British newspaper The Sun that claimed the pair were being evicted from the property, which is owned by the Crown Estate, and that it had since been offered to Prince Andrew, one of King Charles III’s brothers. According to The Sun, the couple was reportedly asked to leave the property days after the release of Harry’s memoir “Spare” in January. The book features a litany of rebukes, criticisms and grievances from his time as a senior member of the royal family.

Drag show banTennessee has become the first state this year to restrict drag show performances. Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill into law Thursday to limit “adult cabaret performances” on public property so as to shield them from the view of children, threatening violators with a misdemeanor and repeat offenders with a felony. The Tennessee measure is the first of nearly a dozen such bills presently working their way through GOP-led state legislatures. Republicans say the performances expose children to sexual themes and images that are inappropriate – a claim rejected by advocates who say the proposed measures are discriminatory against the LGBTQ community and could violate First Amendment laws. The law is set to go into effect on July 1.4. MetaverseDemocratic senators are urging Meta not to market its metaverse app to teens between the ages of 13 and 17, arguing the technology could harm young users’ physical and mental health. The lawmakers, Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, wrote a letter to company CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing concerns around teen users joining digital communities through the use of virtual reality headsets. “Your plans to imminently pull these young people into an under-researched, potentially dangerous virtual realm with consequences for their physical and mental health is unacceptable,” they wrote.

Authorities released audio in which a train driver involved in one of the country’s worst train crashes in recent years was told to ignore a red light. In the wake of the tragedy, a train station master has been charged with mass deaths through negligence and causing grievous bodily harm through negligence. Upon arrest, he blamed the collision on a technical fault, though he later admitted to “making a mistake.” Meanwhile, search and rescue operations at the site of the crash will continue today, officials said, as relatives of those missing await news regarding their loved ones.   Video Ad FeedbackAudio reveals what happened moments before deadly train crash in Greece    02:04   - Source:CNN    THIS JUST INRussian forces blow up vital bridge to Bakhmut, Ukrainian police sayA vital bridge connecting the besieged Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to the nearby village of Khromove has been blown up overnight by Russian forces, according to multiple sources speaking with CNN.

Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin (L), USA Attorney General Merrick B Garland (C), National Prosecutor of Poland Dariusz Barski and a group of international prosecutors meet to discuss allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Lviv, Ukraine March 3, 2023. Roman Baluk/ReutersCNN      Attorney General Merrick Garland made an unannounced trip to Ukraine on Friday, according to a Justice Department official, his second trip to the country after Russia invaded a little more than a year ago.  The trip was not announced for security reasons, the official said.  Garland was invited to Lviv by the Ukrainian prosecutor general, the official said, and joined President Volodymyr Zelensky at the “United for Justice Conference.”  The official added that Garland “held several meetings and reaffirmed our determination to hold Russia accountable for crimes committed in its unjust and unprovoked invasion against its sovereign neighbor.”  The trip comes nearly two weeks after President Joe Biden made his first trip to Ukraine since the war began and is one of several trips made by members of Biden’s Cabinet. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also recently made a trip to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky.  The attorney general last went to Ukraine in June and similarly committed the United States’ assistance in finding and prosecuting those who committed war crimes. During that trip, Garland announced that he was appointing Eli Rosenbaum, the top US so-called “Nazi hunter,” to lead a Justice Department team to identify and prosecute war criminals.  On Wednesday, Garland testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he believed the Russian government was committing crimes against humanity and said the Justice Department supports efforts by The Hague to investigate and prosecute those crimes.    “The United States supports what is now being developed in The Hague, sponsored by Eurojust, looking into the possibility of creating that court [to charge crimes of aggression,]” Garland testified.  “There are concerns that we have to take into account with respect to how that might deal with our own service members and other circumstances,” he continued. “We have to be sure that the appropriate guardrails are up. But we support any number of different ways in which war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the potential for crimes against aggression are investigated.”  The Justice Department has taken several steps to hold the Russian government and its supporters accountable since the invasion began.  The Justice Department’s Task Force KleptoCapture – made up of federal prosecutors, investigators and analysts – has worked for the past year to target the complex web of wealth surrounding Russian oligarchs and Kremlin insiders. Since the beginning of the war, the Justice Department has seized more than $500 million in yachts, properties and other assets from people who support the Russian government and have evaded US sanctions, according to a department news release.  The department has also brought over 30 indictments against sanctioned supporters of the Kremlin and Russian military, the department has said, some of which have directly implicated individuals in supporting the war in Ukraine.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a Quad ministers' panel at the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi on March 3, 2023. Olivier Douliery/APNew Delhi, IndiaCNN      Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and the support flooding in to Kyiv from countries across the world, sends a powerful message to “would be aggressors everywhere,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday during a panel discussion in New Delhi.  “Part of the reason countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have effect here,” Blinken said, speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitics conference.   “If we allow, with impunity, Russia to do what it’s doing in Ukraine, then that’s a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too,” he added.  The comments came as Blinken met with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia – a grouping known as the “Quad,” or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.The Quad is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s, though it has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China’s reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.  The foreign ministers of the United States, India, Japan and Australia meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit on March 3, 2023 in New Delhi.Secretary Antony BlinkenBlinken added that the challenges faced by people around the world cannot be dealt with by “any one country acting alone.”  “The great power of the Quad is you have four like-minded countries, united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, experiences, different comparative ways to tackle these problems,” he said.  Though he didn’t specify any “would-be aggressors,” he made several veiled references, saying the Quad is working on increasing countries’ maritime domain awareness – meaning greater surveillance on things happening in their waters – and tamping down on illegal fishing.  Top US officials have previously called out China for illegal fishing operations that “plunder the region’s provisions,” and accused Beijing’s “maritime militias” of intimidating and harassing Indo-Pacific countries.

But its threats are driving the group closer togetherChina has established the world’s largest naval force, built heavily-fortified islands in the South China Sea, and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels in the disputed waters – frequently stoking tensions with its neighbors, and prompting promises from the US to stand by its partners in the region.  The Quad ministers reiterated the point in a joint statement on Friday, expressing “serious concern at the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities.”  Though sometimes dubbed by critics as an “Asian NATO,” the Quad is not a formal military alliance – rather, it’s an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.  It does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.  Quad members cooperate across various fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.

Now what's Beijing going to do with it?But security and the goal of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” are key focuses – and the Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China’s influence, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing in recent years.  The strategic location of each of the Quad nations – at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them – has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China “clique” that is emblematic of a “poisonous” Cold War mentality.  The joint statement on Friday also touched on other regional and international issues, such as the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar following the military’s bloody coup two years ago, North Korea’s nuclear threat and increasingly aggressive missile testing, and the war in Ukraine.  The four ministers condemned the war “and the immense human suffering it is causing, and concurred that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,” according to the statement.

Video Ad FeedbackHe fled Russia to avoid being sent to Ukraine. Then he got stranded at the Seoul airport    02:44   - Source:CNNSeoul, South KoreaCNN      After spending close to five months stuck inside an airport in South Korea, Dmitry is finally able to breathe fresh air. But he is yet to taste freedom – and his real wait may have only just begun.  He is one of five Russian men who became stranded at Incheon International Airport last year while trying to flee Moscow’s military mobilization order for its war in Ukraine. The South Korean Justice Ministry refused their applications for refugee status, effectively leaving them in limbo at the airport.  Too scared to return to Russia, they resorted to sleeping rough at the airport, living on handout meals from the South Korean immigration department.  Dmitry (not his real name; he asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution if he is sent home) and one other of the men were allowed to leave the airport this week and were checked into a government holding facility – the Immigration Reception Center – while their dispute with the ministry continues. The other three remain in the airport. It’s unclear why the men did not attempt to reach a third country once they realized the difficulties in South Korea.  Applying for refugee status here could take months or years and in the meantime, Dmitry will need prior approval if he wishes to leave the center and even then he will face a 6:00 p.m. curfew and must take a Covid test at his own expense. He will also not be allowed to work.   Two of the five Russians, pictured at South Korea's Incheon International Airport on January 24, 2023.Michelle Ye Hee Lee/The Washington Post/Getty Images/fileBut for Dmitry this semi-existence is better than the alternative – even though he had to leave a wife and 7-year-old son behind in Russia.  “I miss my boy really badly,” said Dmitry, 30, lamenting that his son does not understand why he had to leave. He is too emotional to say anything else about his family.  Dmitry fled Russia in October of last year after President Vladimir Putin called for a mobilization of 300,000 men to join the war in Ukraine. He was one of hundreds of thousands who left his home country in the weeks and months following the September 21 announcement.  He feared he would be among the first to be sent to the front line as he has a record of dissent.  “I felt terrible because I have protested at anti-war rallies… I decided then I need to leave Russia,” he said, adding that six of his friends had already died in Ukraine.

South Korea was the one democratic country he could fly to at the time, he said, though he is aware that the country does not look kindly on those trying to avoid military call-ups – given it has its own mandatory military service of at least 18 months that most men must carry out by the age of 28.  “I’m not a draft dodger, I’m against the war,” he said, a message he wants officials here in Seoul to hear. “I don’t want to go and kill people essentially, so I’m not a draft dodger.”   Incheon International Airport in South Korea.Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesUntil this week, his life in Seoul had largely consisted of a minimal routine of a hot bun and juice for lunch and chicken and rice for dinner provided by immigration with nothing to fill the hours in between but to walk around the airport, surrounded by a constantly changing stream of business travelers and holidaymakers.   He would wash his clothes in a public bathroom sink and says there was no hot water for a shower for the past month, a complaint the immigration department disputes.   “No hot water now, already for one month. I turn on the hot water, but nothing’s coming out,” he says in a video he recorded to back up his claim. He said that in the airport he slept on the floor in a small room with 15 other asylum seekers.  At the government center, things are markedly better. “The conditions here are very good, they feed very well, there is a washing machine, there is an iron, there is hot water, everywhere is clean and everything treats you very well,” he said.Against the oddsDmitry’s asylum application is far from simple. He won the right to apply for refugee status last month, after successfully challenging the Justice Ministry’s decision at the Incheon District Court.  However, the ministry said this week it would appeal that decision.   His lawyer said it could now be another five months before he even learns if he has the right to apply. Even then, success is far from guaranteed given the tiny fraction of refugee applications South Korea accepts.   In 2019, before the Covid pandemic limited the number of applicants arriving in Seoul, only 79 of almost 15,500 applicants were granted refugee status.  “Even the US has a refugee approval rate of almost some 10%,” said his lawyer, Lee Jong-chan. “But it’s less than 1% on average in South Korea. South Korea’s refugee approval (rate) is like a needle hole, so I’m not sure whether it would be easy to thread that hole. We’ll do our best, but I think it’ll be difficult in South Korean reality.”   South Korean lawyer Lee Jong-chan, who represents Russian asylum seekers stranded at Incheon International Airport, outside the district court on February 14, 2023.Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images/FileLee said Dmitry’s best chance at winning asylum lay in this argument: “An objection to serve in the military while in wartime applies to ‘persecution due to political opinions,’ which is one of the five reasons people apply for refugee status.”   But it’s likely to be a long process whatever happens. The lawyer estimates a wait of around five months to learn if they have the right to apply for refugee status, then a further one to two years before they know if they can gain it.   If the application is rejected, Dmitry may still be able to stay in the country under a humanitarian stay permit – though that would have its own drawbacks.  Lee said “those with humanitarian stay status are excluded from most of the benefits South Korean residents or refugees get. They won’t be put in a position where they are forced to leave, but they’ll have to live in South Korea with a lot of restrictions.”  However, that might still be better than the alternative. Lee said that media attention meant their case was now well known in Russia, so the men could be in even greater danger should they be deported.   If he can’t find sanctuary in South Korea, Dmitry said he would consider asking the embassies of the United States and Canada to consider an asylum bid.  But even if any of these countries were ultimately to accept him, Dmitry would remain torn.  He said he never thought he would leave Russia as it is his home and he still holds out hope he will be able to go back one day.   “It would be great if I could return home to Russia,” Dmitry said. “That would mean everything that’s going on would have ended, so the sooner the better.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

The US Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, DC, is seen on February 17, 2023. Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesCNN      Two US nationals were arrested in Kansas City on Thursday for allegedly sending US aviation technology to Russia, the Justice Department announced.   Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, 59, and Douglas Robertson, 55, are facing several charges, including exporting controlled goods without a license, falsifying and failing to file electronic export information, and smuggling goods contrary to US law.  Their arrest is the most recent move by the Justice Department’s Task Force KleptoCapture, made up of federal prosecutors, investigators and analysts, which has worked for the past year to wage a global campaign against money laundering and sanctions evasion in support of the Russian government. Its work has resulted in over 30 indictments against sanctioned supporters of the Kremlin and Russian military, according to the Justice Department.     The two men’s US-based KanRus Trading Company sold and installed Western electronic equipment for airplanes, according to prosecutors, and allegedly sold equipment to Russian companies and provided repair services for Russian aircrafts. To get around US sanctions, prosecutors say Buyanovsky and Robertson concealed who their clients were, lied about how much products cost and were paid through foreign bank accounts.  After Russia’s war in Ukraine began last year, the US government imposed additional sanctions on shipments to Russia. Buyanovsky and Robertson discussed their options for continuing to send shipments to at least one client in Russia, prosecutors say, including by sending shipments through third-party countries.  A KanRus shipment in February 2022 was flagged by the Department of Commerce because it did not have the proper licensing, according to the indictment.  Soon after, Robertson, who is a commercial pilot, allegedly told a Russia-based client that “things are complicated in the USA” and that invoices needed to be less than $50,000 because otherwise there would be “more paperwork and visibility,” adding that “this is NOT the right time for either.” A shipment to that Russian client was later sent through Laos, prosecutors say.    Lawyers for Buyanovsky and Robertson are not yet listed.    CNN’s Jack Forrest contributed to this report.

Ihor said he was stabbed in the legs with a taser at a Russian detention center in Kherson.Vasco Cotovio/CNNCNN      Standing outside a Russian detention center in Kherson, days after the city was liberated, 29-year-old Ihor still shivered as he recalled what he endured inside.   “I was kept here for 11 days and throughout that time I heard screaming from the basement,” Ihor, who asked CNN not to reveal his last name for his protection, said. “I was stabbed in the legs with a taser, they use it as a welcome. One of them asked what I’d been brought in for and another two of them started hitting me in the ribs.  “People were tortured, they were beaten with sticks in the arms and legs, cattle prods, even hooked up to batteries and electrocuted or waterboarded with water,” he added.   Kherson was the first large city and only regional capital Russian troops have able to occupy since the start of the invasion. Moscow’s armies took over the city on March 2, 2022, and occupied it for several months before being forced to withdraw in early November, after a months-long offensive by Ukrainian forces.   The detention center Ihor was held in was part of a network of at least 20 facilities that Ukrainian and international lawyers said was part of a calculated Russian strategy to extinguish Ukrainian identity.   “These detention centers are linked, they follow a very similar, if not identical way of behaving,” Wayne Jordash, head of the Mobile Justice Team, a collective of international investigators supporting Ukraine’s Office of the Prosecutor General, told CNN.   The investigation found that Russian forces followed a very specific blueprint in several occupied areas, with clear patterns that point to the overarching plan of Moscow’s occupation of Ukraine.   “The first stage, essentially, is to detain and, in many instances, kill a category of people labeled as ‘leaders,’ i.e. those who could physically resist the occupation, but also those who could culturally resist it,” Jordash said.   “The second stage is a sort of filtration process where the population that remains outside of the detention centers is subject to constant monitoring and filtration so that anyone who’s suspected of being involved with ‘leaders’ or been involved with organizing any type of resistance is also then identified and either deported to Russia or detained in the detention centers and tortured.”  The Ukrainian flag hangs atop a detention center used by Russian forces to hold and torture Ukrainian soldiers, dissidents and partisans.Vasco Cotovio/CNN""Glory to Ukraine"" now reads at the entrance to a detention centre used by Russian forces to hold and torture Ukrainian soldiers, dissidents and partisans.Vasco Cotovio/CNNJordash said these methods were employed not just in Kherson but in other areas occupied by Russian forces, such as the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha and Borodianka. However, he added, the lengthy occupation of Kherson allowed Russian forces to go even further.   “The third stage [is] the extinguishing of permanent identity,” he said. This can include removing the Ukrainian curriculum from schools, and confiscating objects considered to be pro-Ukrainian such as flags or t-shirts in the country’s colors “Essentially the population [is] locked down so that all traces of Ukrainian identity can be removed,” he explained.   Ihor’s account of the torture he was subjected to while he was detained matches the findings of the Mobile Justice Team and the Ukrainian Prosecutor’s office. The type of behavior he said he was forced to adopt also lines up with the overarching efforts to eradicate Ukrainian identity described by Jordash.   “We were forced to learn [the] Russian anthem. If you wanted to have a cigarette or a candy you had to sing their anthem,” Ihor said when he took CNN to the center he was held at, on November 23, 2022. “When they opened the door you had to shout, ‘Glory to Russia! Glory to Putin! Glory to Shoigu!’” Sergei Shoigu is Russian defense minister.  “We were beaten if we didn’t do this,” Ihor added.   Archie, who also did not want us to reveal his last name over security concerns, said he was tortured at the same facility. Vasco Cotovio/CNNIhor's account of the torture he was subjected to while he was detained matches the findings of the Mobile Justice Team and the Ukrainian Prosecutor's office. Vasco Cotovio/CNNHe wasn’t alone. Another detainee CNN spoke with, Archie, who also did not want us to reveal his last name over security concerns, said he was tortured at the same facility.   “They beat me, electrocuted me, kicked me and beat me with batons,” Archie, 20 recalled. “I can’t say they starved me, but they didn’t give much to eat.” Archie said he was lucky enough to be let go after nine days and after being forced to record a video saying he’d agreed to work with the Russian occupiers.  Ukrainian and International investigators also said they discovered financial links connecting these detention centers to the Russian state.  “Those detention centers have financial links to the Russian state,” Jordash said, citing documents uncovered by the investigators. “These financial documents, they show that the civilian administration is being financed from Russia and the civilian administration is financing the detention centers, so you have very clear patterns and very clear links.”  CNN has not been able to independently review the documents cited by the investigation.   Jordash said these are just the preliminary results of the investigation, explaining that more evidence of Russian war crimes is still being uncovered and processed.   He also said the newly released findings are a helpful indicator of what is happening in the territories currently occupied by Russia, or of what would have happen should Moscow succeed in completely taking over Ukraine.     'Archie' killed two Russian soldiers on his own, days after they took over Kherson. He later joined up with other partisans to form a coordinated resistance movement. Vasco Cotovio/CNNStories of Ukrainian resistance revealed after Kherson pullout“For me, what is interesting about Kherson is you really see the microcosm of the overall criminal plan, what would have happened to [the rest of] Ukraine” he explained. “What’s horrifying, as much as the torture …= is the thought of what would have happened, had Russia managed to be successful in its occupation of vast areas of of Ukraine.”   For Jordash, a larger Russian occupation would have lead to an “unprecedented” number of detentions, as well as cases of torture and killings.  “This criminal plan which involves the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity, at its very core, you see this moving to a more final, destructive phase, which seems to suggest that absent success in the original plan the plan turns into one of physical destruction, more deaths, more destruction, and potentially genocidal intent,” he said.  CNN reached out to the Russian government for comment on the accusations put forward by Ukrainian and international investigators but has yet to hear back. Russia has repeatedly denied any and all accusations that it has committed war crimes during what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.  Despite Moscow’s denials, CNN teams on the ground witnessed the brutal results of Russian occupation not just of Kherson but also places like Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, uncovering evidence of torture, and indiscriminate killing of ordinary civilians. In January, Human Rights Watch accused Moscow of a “litany of violations of international humanitarian law,” and earlier in the week, UN Secretary General António Guterres said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had triggered “the most massive violations of human rights we are living [through] today.”  “It has unleashed widespread death, destruction and displacement,” Guterres continued.

It’s like, let me tell you what I saw or what I heard, or what people are saying to me.”  “It’s in that context because I’m out every day. I’m in the classroom. I’m out, you know, somewhere in the United States,” she added. “I think it’s a good balance really.”  And on the other side of the relationship, Biden said her husband helps her understand there are different ways of looking at issues and viewpoints.  “Well, sometimes I don’t, I may not see things from his perspective. Let’s just put it that way. And so he offers both sides,” she said. “I’m always better like, ‘This person feels this way.’ ‘Yes, but this is why they,’ – you know, he’s very good at that – understanding why people feel the way they do. He understands both sides, which is part of his strength.”  Her comments came during a wide-ranging interview with CNN on her five-day visit to Africa, which included stops in Namibia and Kenya.  CNNvideo    Hear what first lady thinks about Biden's reelection plansBiden, who has been married to the president for nearly 46 years, has long said she’s not an adviser to her husband, but she is his most trusted partner and wields a significant amount of influence within the White House. The first lady told CNN she is “all for” her husband running for reelection in 2024 but also left an opening should he decide not to run, noting, “If he wants to do something else, we’re there too.”  Biden plays a unique role as first lady, the first to hold a full-time paid job outside of the White House. She teaches English and writing full time at Northern Virginia Community College, a job she also held for her eight years as second lady when her husband was vice president.  From her perch at the White House, she has spent time advocating for education issues, helping military families through her “Joining Forces” initiative and working to end cancer through the “Cancer Moonshot.” The first lady is one of the Biden administration’s most often used surrogates at events across the country.  “I think it’s all so interesting and really fulfilling for me as, as a teacher, and as a woman, you know, to see the empowerment of other young women in them getting education,” she said when asked how she balance the two roles. “There’s nothing I can ever give up.”  “I really feel like I’ve grown so much in this role, because of the opportunities that I’ve been given whether it’s traveling to Africa, or whether it’s traveling to Nebraska,” she added. “I see so many different communities and reach out to people in all walks of life.”  Biden said her experiences as an educator and first lady have helped her build connections with people during her travels abroad, which has included trips to 10 countries in her first two years in the role.  “Joe tends towards policy,” she said. “I try to, you know, go in a little bit maybe a softer direction.”  The first lady traveled to Africa to emphasize the United States’ commitment to the region at a time when Russia and China have made inroads on the continent.  “We want to say, ‘Hey, we’re back. We’re back. And we’re here to meet you halfway,’” she said.  It marked her sixth trip to Africa after having traveled to the continent five times as second lady. She focused on delivering messages about women’s empowerment, youth engagement, and the need to preserve democracy as well as highlighted programs funded through PEPFAR, the Bush-era initiative aimed at fighting HIV/AIDS around the world.  The first lady also looked to shine a spotlight on the severe drought affecting East Africa, traveling to the rural village Lositeti in Kenya on her final day in the country.  “Livestock is dying. There’s no water. There’s no grass. There are no crops. Mothers can’t lactate. They’re not able to feed their children. It’s a major problem,” she said. “I’m here before it gets any worse to try to create awareness and say, ‘How can we find solutions for these major problems?’”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Video Ad FeedbackTop hostage negotiator's message to Paul Whelan: 'Keep the faith, we're coming to get you'    01:40   - Source:CNNCNN      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly revealed for the first time Thursday that the United States has put forward a “serious proposal” to secure wrongfully detained Paul Whelan’s release from Russia.  US officials have long stressed their commitment to bringing home Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2018, but the public disclosure that a deal is on the table marks a notable development in those efforts.  In a “brief engagement” with Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting Thursday, Blinken said he pressed the Russian foreign minister on Whelan’s detention and the offer.  “The United States has put forward a serious proposal. Moscow should accept it,” Blinken said at a news conference following the meeting with Lavrov.  State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday that this “was not a proposal that the Russians heard for the first time today.”  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a press conference with Egypt's Foreign Minister (not pictured) in Cairo, on January 30, 2023. - Blinken kicked off a Middle East trip in Cairo focussed on urging calm amid an escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians.Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesBlinken met with Russian foreign minister for first time since Ukraine war beganPrice declined to give details on that proposal, but said it was one “that we have conveyed to them consistently in the past.”  “We have conveyed in some detail, in all of the necessary detail to the Russian Federation, the proposal that we have put on the table,” Price said at a department briefing. “We have gone about this relentlessly, we have gone about this creatively, seeking to do everything we can to see the release of Paul Whelan.”  Price would not say whether the Russian government had engaged with that proposal.  Whelan was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in June 2020.  The United States was unable to secure his freedom from Russia in a prisoner swap that brought home another detained American – Brittney Griner – in December. Multiple US officials said following Griner’s release that the Russians refused to negotiate a deal for Whelan.  Notably, prior to Thursday’s engagement, the last time Blinken spoke with Lavrov – and the only other time the two have spoken directly since the war in Ukraine began – was in a phone call last July, when he “pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.”  CNN reported in January that US “have had direct conversations with Russian officials regarding” Whelan in the wake of Griner’s release.  Whelan, who called CNN exclusively from his remote penal colony in the hours following Griner’s release, said he hoped President Joe Biden and his administration “would do everything they could to get me home, regardless of the price they might have to pay at this point.”  On Thursday, Whelan’s family praised Blinken for bringing his case up in the engagement with Lavrov.  Elizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan’s sister, told CNN following Blinken’s exchange with Lavrov that “of course, we are pleased to see Paul’s case elevated in this manner, and take a great deal of comfort in the fact that the Secretary of State continues to press for a solution to Paul’s wrongful detention.”  David Whelan that the mention of his brother “at such a rare engagement between the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister” was appreciated.  “It reinforces our sense that the White House continues to advocate for Paul, even if we do not always see the activity,” he told CNN.

US adds Chinese genetics firms to trade blacklist over surveillance allegations    			By Philip Wang and Kathleen Magramo, CNN		  Published  11:06 PM EST, Thu March 2, 2023    Link Copied!   The US Department of Commerce oversees export controls.Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images/FileAtlanta/Hong KongCNN      The United States on Thursday added two subsidiaries of Chinese genetics company BGI to a trade blacklist over allegations it conducted genetic analysis and surveillance activities for Beijing, which Washington says was used to repress ethnic minorities in China.  The US Department of Commerce, which oversees export controls, said in a statement that BGI Research and BGI Tech Solutions (Hongkong) “present a significant risk of diversion to China’s military programs.”  FILE - Residents watch a convoy of security personnel armed with batons and shields patrol through central Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region, Nov. 5, 2017. China's discriminatory detention of Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the western region of Xinjiang may constitute crimes against humanity, the U.N. human rights office said in a long-awaited report Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022, which cited ""serious"" rights violations and patterns of torture in recent years. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)Ng Han Guan/APUN report on China's Uyghurs: What you need to know“The addition of these entities is based upon information that indicates their collection and analysis of genetic data poses a significant risk of contributing to monitoring and surveillance by the government of China, which has been utilized in the repression of ethnic minorities in China,” the statement said.  CNN has reached out to BGI Group, which is one of the world’s largest genomics companies and a listed firm based in Shenzhen, for comment on its subsidiaries.  In 2020, the US Department of Commerce added two other BGI affiliates, Xinjiang Silk Road BGI and Beijing Liuhe BGI, to the trade blacklist over their alleged involvement in human right abuses against Uyghur and other mainly Muslim minorities in China’s far western region of Xinjiang.   BGI Group issued a statement at the time denying the allegations, saying it “does not engage in unethical practices and does not provide gene technology for the surveillance of Uighurs.”  Rights groups have documented human rights abuses in Xinjiang since the 2000s, including forced labor and coercive enforcement of family planning and birth control policies on Uyghur minorities, according to a damning United Nations report last year. China has regularly pushed back against these reports with firm denials.  The latest list compiled by the US Department of Commerce includes a total of 28 Chinese entities, four from Pakistan, three from Myanmar and one each from Belarus, Russia and Taiwan.  Being placed on the list means the entities are restricted from buying American technology and other goods.

Smoke from a forest fire in the republic of Sakha in Siberia, Russia, in July 2021.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images/FILECNN      The world’s most northerly forests could be a “time bomb” of planet-warming pollution as expanding wildfires have released record high levels of planet-heating pollution into the atmosphere, according to a new study.  Using new satellite data analysis techniques, researchers found that, since 2000, summer wildfires have expanded in boreal forests, which wrap around the northernmost parts of the Earth.   Boreal forest fires usually make up 10% of global wildfire-related carbon pollution. But in 2021, their contribution soared to 23%, according to the study, as extreme drought and heatwaves in Siberia and Canada helped drive intense fires.  “Boreal forests could be a time bomb of carbon, and the recent increases in wildfire emissions we see make me worry the clock is ticking,” said study author Steven Davis, a professor of earth system science at the University of California at Irvine, in a press release.  A member of Russia's Aerial Forest Protection Service pictured during wildfires in July 2021.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images/FILEThese forests, which cover huge swaths of Canada, Russia and Alaska, are the world’s largest land biome. They are also carbon dense, releasing 10 to 20 times more planet-heating carbon pollution for each unit of area burned by wildfires than other ecosystems, according to the study.  Boreal forests are one of the fastest warming biomes on Earth, and warmer and drier fire seasons are contributing to expanding wildfires.  Russia’s Siberian region experienced particularly bad wildfires in 2021 which burned nearly 45 million acres (18.16 million hectares) of Russian forest in 2021.  In July that year, reconnaissance pilot Svyatoslav Kolesov told CNN he couldn’t fly his plane in the far eastern Russian region of Yukutia because smoke from the fires was so thick.  The region is prone to wildfires and much of the land is covered in forests, but Kolesov said something has changed.  “New fires have appeared in the north of Yakutia, in places where there were no fires last year and where it had not burned at all before,” he said.  The sun seen through smoke from wildfires in Siberia in July 2021.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images/FILEWildfires are becoming larger and more intense and they are also happening in places that aren’t used to such extreme fires. The situation is likely to worsen as temperatures rise, study author Bo Zheng, an assistant professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told CNN via email.  Higher temperatures encourage the growth of vegetation, which then becomes exceptionally dry during heatwaves, increasing the risk of wildfires.  “We are facing dangerous positive feedback between climate and boreal fires,” Zheng said.   “Heatwaves and droughts are likely to occur more frequently over the boreal region, and the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires like those in 2021 are likely to increase, with the release of CO2 emissions in turn leading to further global warming,” he added.

Ed Jones/AFP/Getty ImagesJeff Wells, the vice president for boreal conservation at the conservation organization National Audubon Society, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that he was not surprised that the study had found such a high level of carbon pollution from boreal fires. But, he said, “the size of the spike in 2021 is shocking.”   The findings are “yet another stark warning” of the need to “drastically reduce CO2 emissions,” Wells said.  Wells also pointed to the role Indigenous communities play in protecting forests and peatlands.  “It is time the world recognizes the leadership and knowledge of Indigenous peoples and their governments in the boreal and across the world in stewarding their traditional territories, especially in the face of the increase in the size and frequency of wildfires,” said Wells.

Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty ImagesWashingtonCNN      The US is announcing three new partnerships on Thursday as an effort to boost Ukraine’s agricultural sector and help supply the country’s grain to the world, USAID officials told CNN.   The announcement is part of a deliberate effort by the Biden administration to build up Ukraine’s economy and alleviate the global food security crisis which has been exacerbated following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   Ukraine is regarded as a key bread-basket for much of the world, and the country relies on agriculture to generates more than 40% of total export revenues. The country’s economy shrank by more than 30% in 2022 after Russia’s brutal invasion destroyed infrastructure, hurt businesses and disrupted daily life, according to Kyiv’s economic ministry.  USAID’s new partnerships with Grain Alliance, Kernel, and Nibulon are projected to increase Ukraine’s grain shipping capacity by more than 3 million tons annually, the officials said. Each company has a long history of working in Ukraine.   Working together USAID and these organizations are planning to invest $44 million to support storage and infrastructure expansion in Ukraine’s agriculture sector.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a press conference with Egypt's Foreign Minister (not pictured) in Cairo, on January 30, 2023. - Blinken kicked off a Middle East trip in Cairo focussed on urging calm amid an escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians.Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesBlinken met with Russian foreign minister for first time since Ukraine war beganThis comes after USAID has announced multiple different initiatives to support Ukraine’s agriculture sector, including programs to specifically target Ukrainian farmers.  Earlier this year, one of the efforts included a new donation of high-quality vegetable seeds to Ukrainian farmers to help address the crisis created by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion against Ukraine.  “Through AGRI-Ukraine, nearly 30% of Ukraine’s registered farmers have benefited with seeds, fertilizers, crop protection, storage, access to financing and other services, helping over 13,600 farmers deliver this year’s harvest and plant winter crops,” said a USAID spokesperson.   A Black Sea grain deal has also enabled the passage of Ukrainian ships carrying the agriculture products to depart the country, which was a challenge in the early days of the war with Russia preventing the ships from leaving.  “Thanks in large part to UN Secretary General Guterres and Turkiye the Black Sea grain deal initiative loosened Russia’s stranglehold on Ukraine’s ports, allowing more than 22 million metric tons of grain and other food -that’s the equivalent of 8 billion loaves of bread – to leave Ukraine sports for global markets, and that’s lowered the price of food for people everywhere,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday in New Delhi where he attended a G20 Foreign Ministers meeting.   But Blinken warned that the current deal is set to expire later this month and Russia has not agreed to extend the vital agreement.  “Today, Russia is again slow-walking the export of food from Ukraine and with the Black Sea initiative set to expire on March 18 Russia has refused to commit to renewing it,” Blinken said.   Blinken said that countries at the meeting sent a clear message of the need to extend the deal.  The new investments that USAID and its partners are announcing this week will target multiple terminals – Izmail and Reni in Ukraine, both on the Danube River, and Čierna nad Tisou in Slovakia – where they expect to see an increase in grain exports. The operations will involve construction to renovate the areas where vessels are loaded.

Here's what you need to knowTo further grease the wheel on the Slovakia operations, Grain Alliance will purchase a transshipment storage facility in the country.  USAID’s funding is being used to procure grain loading equipment, temporary storage structures and remanufactured locomotives for use in Ukraine.   Just last week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was in Kyiv for a series of meetings and engagements, including with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to reaffirm the United States’ support of Ukraine and to announce the recent transfer of $1.25 billion in economic and budgetary assistance.  Yellen said she expects the Ukrainian economy’s growth to be weaker as the country loses foreign investment and runs through its reserves and rainy day funds, which means securing investments in Ukraine’s agriculture sector are even more vital.  “We will see an increasing toll on Russia’s economic trajectory over time,” she said. “And their ability to replenish the military equipment that’s been destroyed in their attacks on Ukraine, that’s been very greatly jeopardized.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at Palm Beach Atlantic University in West Palm Beach on February 15, 2023.Wilfredo Lee/APCNN      Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday distanced himself from his past support for privatizing Social Security and raising the retirement age as potential future political foes seize on his previous ideas for the popular retirement program.  “We’re not going to mess with Social Security as Republicans,” DeSantis told Fox News. “I think that that’s pretty clear.”  As a congressman, DeSantis voted for nonbinding budget resolutions that would have made age 70 the new threshold for seniors to collect their federal benefits. A recent CNN KFile review review of DeSantis’ comments during his 2012 congressional campaign found support for privatizing Social Security as well.  Octavio Jones/Getty ImagesRon DeSantis once expressed support for privatizing Social Security and Medicare giving his rivals an opening The attempt by DeSantis to publicly walk back a position foundational to the fiscal conservatism that defined his early political career comes as former President Donald Trump has made support for Medicare and Social Security an early fault line in the 2024 GOP presidential primary. Trump has singled out DeSantis, who is traveling the country to promote his new book and raise his profile ahead of a highly anticipated campaign for president.   Unloading on his social media platform, Trump this week called DeSantis “the man who wants to cut Social Security and Medicare” and a “wheelchair over the cliff kind of guy, just like his hero, failed politician Paul Ryan.” The criticism revived an attack line Democrats used over a decade ago to undercut Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who proposed partial privatization of Medicare and Social Security in his budget blueprints and was named Mitt Romney’s running mate in 2012. In an ad that aired in multiple swing states, an actor seemingly portraying Ryan wheeled an elderly woman to the edge of a cliff and pushed her over.  DeSantis has largely avoided engaging with Trump and didn’t previously respond to questions about his past positions. His new book, “The Courage to Be Free,” glosses over his early political career and his nearly three terms in Congress, instead focusing largely on the cultural fights that have defined his first term as governor and fueled his ascent in the GOP.   But Thursday, in his latest of several appearances promoting his book, DeSantis was asked by Fox News host Dana Perino about a proposal to raise the retirement age for federal benefits to 70. He pivoted to criticizing President Joe Biden’s past votes on Social Security before appearing to dismiss concerns about the long-term financial outlook of federal entitlement programs.  “There’s a lot of the budget people used to say, they would blame Social Security or Medicare for budget woes. But the reality is they have printed trillions and trillions of dollars, and that has really fueled the inflation,” the governor said.  The statement appears at odds with what DeSantis said in 2012, when he first ran for Congress as a tea party conservative and a disciple of Ryan’s and his hawkish budgets. DeSantis said at the time that it was “unsustainable” to allow seniors to retire before their late 60s, CNN KFile found. He also voiced support for Ryan’s plans for privatizing Social Security.  “What I think we need to do for people in my generation, particularly, is start to restructure the program in a way that’s going to be financially sustainable, both Social Security and Medicare,” he said at the time.  DeSantis’ about-face drew immediate rebuke Thursday from the Democratic National Committee, which accused the Republican governor in a press release of attempting to “completely rewrite his long, established record of supporting cuts to Social Security and Medicare.” On social media, the party posted side-by-side video featuring DeSantis’ past comments and his remarks Thursday.    Wilfredo Lee/APFour takeaways from DeSantis' new book rehashing his culture clashes as Florida governorAs Trump pressures Republicans to support Medicare and Social Security, other potential 2024 contenders have voiced support for making changes to the programs. Former Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC last month that Social Security and Medicare needs to be “on the table” in dealing with US national debt. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley declared early in her campaign for president that “we do have to address entitlements” for future beneficiaries.  DeSantis’ pivot marks the second time he has appeared to change his position to more closely align with Trump’s. The governor recently voiced opposition to American intervention in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, after repeatedly voicing support in the past for sending “defensive and offensive” weapons to Ukraine to deter Russian aggression.   While Trump has tried to pull his potential primary opponents into uncomfortable policy fights in recent weeks, DeSantis has sought to steer the narrative around his likely candidacy to his legislative wins as governor. He launched his new book a day after signing a bill that effectively gives him control of Disney’s special taxing district in Florida, a saga that is recounted in detail in his political memoir.  In his appearance on Fox News, DeSantis teased a potential announcement after the upcoming legislative session, which starts next week, when the governor is expected to push through more of his ideological agenda.   “When we get on the other side of that, assuming we’ve been successful,” DeSantis said, “we’ll take a look at what that would mean for national.”  This story has been updated with additional information.

The North Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 18, 2022.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      The White House on Thursday released an ambitious national cybersecurity strategy that calls for new federal regulation of vulnerable critical infrastructure firms and for software makers to be held liable when their products leave gaping holes for hackers to exploit.  The strategy – shaped by major hacking incidents that threatened key public services in the first year of the Biden administration – embraces the US government’s regulatory and purchasing power to force companies that are critical to economic and national security to raise their cyber defenses.  It reflects a widely held belief in the US government that market forces have failed to keep the nation safe from cybercriminals and an array of foreign governments such as Russia and China.   “We have to drive the entire ecosystem to be more cyber vigilant,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with CNN on Thursday.  The Biden administration will look for new regulatory authorities if necessary “to make sure that we are shoring up our critical infrastructure” in the face of advanced hacking threats “because the adversaries are not decreasing in activity, only increasing.”  Acting National Cyber Director Kemba Walden said that too often small businesses and local governments bear the brunt of cyberattacks.  “This isn’t just unfair, it’s ineffective,” said Walden, a White House official, told reporters on Wednesday.  The strategy is a policy document and not law, but it could shape corporate behavior for years to come as firms compete for billions of dollars in federal contracts that increasingly require a minimum set of cybersecurity defenses. And the White House says it wants to work with Congress to develop legislation that holds software makers liable when their products and services don’t provide adequate protections from sabotage.   The goal of US government and corporate work on cybersecurity should be to “correct market failures, minimize the harms from cyber incidents to society’s most vulnerable,” a copy of the strategy states.   The strategy does not specify which sectors of the economy the administration could regulate next, but US officials have previously signaled that one area of focus could be health care. Ransomware attacks – hacks that lock up computer systems and demand a fee – have put an even greater stress on hospitals across the country struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.   So far, the Biden administration has imposed cybersecurity requirements on sectors such as aviation and oil and gas pipelines. The genesis for those regulations in many ways was a May 2021 ransomware attack by an alleged Russian-speaking hacker that shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipelines in the US for days.  Corporations have sometimes balked at the regulations.  After oil and gas industry groups complained that cybersecurity regulations from the Transportation Security Administration were too onerous and unrealistic, the Biden administration last year revised the regulations to give pipeline operators more time to report cyber incidents to the government.  Multiple administrations, including the Trump and Obama administrations, have tried to shore up federal defenses against hacking threats and in some cases drive big changes that make agencies safer in the long term.   There has been some progress. Agencies now have more visibility into malicious cyber activity than ever before, officials say.   But in other cases, bureaucratic inertia has gotten in the way. The Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, says it has made over 700 public recommendations for federal agencies to improve their cyber defenses since 2010. About a fifth of the recommendations had not been implemented as of December, according to GAO.  In the last month, the US Marshals Service was hit by a ransomware attack that affected sensitive law enforcement information, and the FBI has had to deal with a cyber incident involving a computer network used in investigations of child sexual exploitation.  In the interview Thursday, Mayorkas said it was incumbent on the federal government to share what it learns from hacking incidents so the private sector can protect itself.  “The lessons learned should spread throughout the entire cyber ecosystem and not be limited to the particular domain in which it occurs,” Mayorkas told CNN.  Geopolitics has also been a roadblock to improved cybersecurity. The US has for years tried to blunt the impacts of hacking operations from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, to limited effect. And US officials have accused all of those governments of harboring, or even enlisting, cybercriminals that attack US organizations – accusations those governments deny.  After the big pipeline hack in 2021, President Joe Biden made a big push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on cybercriminals operating from Russia. But any chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago.   A senior administration official acknowledged the obstacle when rolling out the new cybersecurity strategy.   “We do have a problem where Russia is serving as a de facto safe haven for cybercrime,” the official told reporters.  In the last few years, including during the Trump administration, US officials have rallied support from allies in Europe and elsewhere to condemn alleged hacking operations from Russia and China, and to arrest cybercriminals who travel to Europe.  “[T]he criminal justice isn’t going to be able to on its own address this problem,” the senior official added, “so we do need to look at other elements of national power to be going after the threat.”  The official cited US Treasury Department sanctions on hackers and the State Department’s multi-million-dollar offers for information on criminal gangs and intelligence operatives. US military and intelligence services also conduct their own hacking operations to collect intelligence or to try to deter foreign governments in cyberspace.  “We want to shrink the surface of the earth that people can conduct malicious cyber activity with impunity,” the senior official said, “and put pressure on them and make their lives a little bit less pleasurable.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Russia is being accused of exporting influence on Ukrainian streets with teenage gangs inspired by a Japanese anime show.TelegramCNN      Ukrainian authorities are accusing Russia of trying to export an unlikely phenomenon: teenage gangs inspired by a Japanese anime game who are taking to the streets for mass brawls.  These gangs have become known as “Redan PMC,” combining the name of a Japanese anime character with the acronym for Private Military Company, made infamous by the Wagner mercenary group.  They appear to have started in Moscow as a vehicle for teenagers to fight organized gangs of football fans. The teenagers organize through Telegram channels and turn up at designated venues as flash mobs. A recent video showed a running battle at a shopping mall in the Russian capital. Russian news agencies also reported a brawl at a subway station in Moscow.  Russia pool via VGTRKvideo    Children from Ukraine are being used in Russia's pro-war rallyIn the last week, Redan gangs have also begun appearing on the streets of several Ukrainian cities – giving more work to an already overstretched police force. Groups of teenagers have gathered in the capital, Kyiv, as well as Lviv and Kharkiv; a 16-year-old alleged ringleader was detained in Dnipro.  Redan fans wear a very particular motif: the outline of a spider with the number 4. It is derived from a Japanese anime series called “Hunter x Hunter,” in which there is a gangster group called Gen’ei Ryodan (hence Redan). Social media videos and images show that Redan members in Russia also favor black hoodies and checked pants.  Russian authorities have acknowledged the emergence of Redan. State news agency RIA Novosti reported that more than 350 people – 319 of them minors – had been taken to police stations in Moscow for being involved in Redan. It quoted a security source as saying gas cartridges and knives had been confiscated.  The agency also reported that supporters of the “Redan subculture” had been detained in Kazan, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.   Redan’s emergence has even got the Kremlin talking. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday it was important to stop “illegal actions. And, of course, it is rather, let’s say, a pseudo-subculture that goes with a minus sign and which does nothing good for our youth.”  A general view shows buildings damaged by a Russian military strike, amid their attack on Ukraine, in the frontline city of Bakhmut, in Donetsk region, Ukraine February 27, 2023. REUTERS/Alex BabenkoAlex Babenko/ReutersRussian fighters are edging into the city of Bakhmut. Here's what you need to knowBut Ukraine’s national police claim the Russians are trying to export Redan’s negative influence to Ukrainian teenagers through a disinformation campaign on Telegram channels.  The police said Tuesday that they had blocked 18 Telegram channels and groups “created to conduct Russian military information campaigns, undermine the domestic situation in Ukraine and involve minors in illegal activities.”  They added that “about 30 youth gatherings took place in different regions of the country over the course of two days. Law enforcement officers immediately responded and prevented conflicts among teenagers.”  In Kharkiv alone, law enforcement officers identified 245 participants in what it called a flash mob launched by the Russian Federation. 215 of them were minors. Volodymyr Tymoshko, the city police chief said the Russian security services – the FSB – had “gathered all these people through manipulation and deception, and they should have started a fight so the Russian TV could use it. Gas canisters, knives, brass knuckles were found in the possession of many (participants).”  On Tuesday, the police cyber unit said it had detained the 16-year-old founder of a Redan Telegram channel in the city of Dnipro.  In a video recorded and later released by the police, the teenager says: “I am the founder of a group with about 2,500 members. I created it to make money from advertising posts, as the topic of Redan is popular on social media.”  He adds that the idea “came from Russia, intending destabilization. I ask everyone to stop organizing meetings and looking for Redanists.”  In the Ukrainian capital, police said the instigators of “the subculture that came from Russia” were two teenagers, a girl aged 15 who had created a Telegram channel and a 14-year-old boy who had organized a “conflict meeting.”  G-20 flags in New Delhi on February 28, 2023.Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesGrand test for Indian diplomacy as American, Chinese and Russian ministers meet in Delhi In an interview posted by police, the girl said the group was “just for hype… I also want to say there is no Redan [in] Kyiv.” Like the teenager in Dnipro, she added that the Redan fad was “straight-up Russian propaganda. I ask that you not believe such information and focus on caring about our guys who are now fighting.”  Vasyl Bohdan, head of the Juvenile Prevention Department of the National Police, said a total of more than 700 people had been summoned to police stations, most of them minors. Bohdan said the force was appealing to parents to “show interest in who their children communicate with.”  It seems likely that now police in both Russia and Ukraine are moving against Redanists, the fad will fade. But its sudden emergence on both sides of the border may speak as much to teenage boredom and the power of social media channels as to any cunning destabilization plan.

Video Ad Feedback'US will have to send their sons and daughters': See what critics edited out of Zelensky's remarks    03:03   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      A viral video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky takes his remarks out of context to wrongly make it sound like he demanded that Americans send their sons and daughters to fight in the war in Ukraine.  The out-of-context 19-second video has been viewed millions of times on Twitter. It features a clip of Zelensky speaking at a news conference last week as an interpreter translates his words into English as follows: “The US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. And they will have to fight, because it’s NATO that we’re talking about. And they will be dying, God forbid, because it’s a horrible thing.”  The clip has circulated widely on Twitter among critics of American financial and military support for the Ukrainian defense against Russia’s invasion. Monica Crowley, a conservative commentator who served in the Trump administration as a spokesperson for the Treasury Department, posted the video on Tuesday night and wrote, “Zelensky now directly threatening us and claiming American sons and daughters will have to fight and die for Ukraine. HELL NO.”  Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah shared former Trump administration official William Wolfe’s tweet of the video in which Wolfe claimed that Zelensky wants “dead Americans on Ukrainian soil.” Lee himself added in a tweet on Tuesday night: “Zelensky has no right to presume that our sons and daughters will fight his war. Shame on him. We’ve somehow sent the message that we work for him. Shame on us!”   Facts First: Zelensky did not say that American sons and daughters will have to fight in Ukraine or die for Ukraine. Rather, he predicted that if Ukraine loses the war against Russia because it does not receive sufficient assistance, Russia will proceed to enter North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries in the Baltics (a region made up of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that the US will have to send troops to defend. Under the treaty that governs NATO, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Ukraine is not a NATO member.Lee deleted his tweet after CNN informed his office on Wednesday about how the video was taken out of context.  Zelensky made the comments at a news conference on the anniversary of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. He was asked what message he would give to the growing number of Americans who believe the US is giving Ukraine too much support.  Zelensky began by saying, per the interpreter, “I would like to thank all of the American people that are supporting Ukraine – the Congress, the president, the TV channels, the journalists, and everyone that has been supporting us.” He urged the US to avoid losing its position of “leadership” in the world, asked Americans to see the Ukrainian people as similar to themselves, and said that while Ukraine enjoys “bipartisan support” in the US, he hears sentiments from time to time that are “dangerous.”  Soon after, he said, “The US is never going to give up on the NATO member states. If it happens so that Ukraine, due to various opinions and weakening – depleting – of assistance, loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO member states, and then the US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. And they will have to fight, because it’s NATO that we’re talking about. And they will be dying, God forbid, because it’s a horrible thing. I wish peace and Ukrainian support to the United States.”  Zelensky’s critics are perfectly entitled to criticize his actual remarks about the necessity of continued US support for Ukraine. But it’s just inaccurate to depict Zelensky’s “have to send their sons and daughters” remark as a demand that Americans take part in combat on Ukrainian soil.  Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment, and Crowley could not be immediately reached for comment. The out-of-context video has been fact-checked by Reuters and BBC journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh, among others.

Here’s why.    			By Laura Paddison, CNN		  Updated  12:27 PM EST, Thu March 2, 2023    Link Copied!   Greta Thunberg joins a demonstration in Oslo with Indigenous and environmental protestors.NTB/Ole Berg-Rusten/ReutersCNN      It may seem strange to see Greta Thunberg protesting against wind turbines, but this week the Swedish climate activist has joined Indigenous and environmental groups in Norway to do just that.  Dozens of protestors, including Thunberg, have blocked access to Norwegian government buildings in Oslo to protest against two windfarms built on Sámi reindeer grazing grounds.  On Wednesday morning, 10 people including Thunberg were removed by police from the entrance of the ministry of finance, according to a spokesperson for the Oslo police district.  The Sámi people, the only recognized Indigenous group within the European Union, say their centuries-old tradition of reindeer herding is jeopardized by the windfarms in the Fosen region in Central Norway. Among the largest onshore windfarms in Europe, they are made up of 151 wind turbines that stretch 285 feet high.   “The constructions are stealing the reindeer’s grazing land,” Maja Kristine Jåma, a reindeer herder and Sámi politician, told CNN. The reindeer are also affected by the infrastructure around the turbines, including roads, she said. “It disturbs them a lot.”   Jåma and others are calling for the turbines to be torn down and the reindeer grazing lands restored.  “Indigenous rights, human rights, must go hand-in-hand with climate protection and climate action. That can’t happen at the expense of some people,” Thunberg told Reuters on Monday.   Wind turbines in the Fosen region, Norway.Nora Buli/Reuters/FILEThe fight over the wind turbines has been long running.  In October 2021, the Sámi people secured a legal victory. Norway’s Supreme Court ruled that the wind farm permits were invalid because the turbines violated the protected cultural rights of Sámi people by infringing on reindeer grazing lands.   But nearly a year and half on, the turbines are still operating.   “So far, the government has not even acknowledged the Supreme Court’s ruling on the violation of human rights or offered an apology to the Reindeer Sámi,” Eirik Larsen, Political Advisor to the Sámi Parliament in Norway, told CNN on Tuesday.  That changed on Thursday when, amid the ongoing protest, Petroleum and Energy Minister Terje Aasland apologized after holding talks with Sámi representatives.  “In these conversations, I apologized on behalf of the government to the reindeer herding districts in Fosen that the concession decision involves a violation of human rights,” Aasland said.   “The government’s message is clear and concise, we must follow up on the Supreme Court ruling so that the rights of the reindeer herding Sámi in Fosen are safeguarded,” Aasland said on Thursday. “They have been in a demanding and unclear situation for a long time. I’m sorry for that.”  The Norwegian government said it is assessing how to secure the Sámi’s rights in Fosen. “The Supreme Court has considered that the permits that have been granted are invalid, but it does not follow from the judgment that the wind turbines must be taken down,” Elisabeth Sæther, State Secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum, told CNN.  Sæther added that the government has been consulting with reindeer herders and the Sámi Parliament to find solutions “that make it possible for reindeer herding and the wind turbines to operate side by side,” a position Aasland echoed in his apology.  What’s happening in Norway is part of a growing conundrum when it comes to the green transition: How to implement climate policies without riding roughshod over Indigenous rights and the environment.  Wind energy is an important plank in Norway’s green energy transition. The country’s electricity generation is already almost completely renewable. In 2020, more than 90% of its electricity was generated using hydropower and wind, which has increased 10-fold in the last decade, accounted for 6.5%.   Norway, which remains a major oil and gas producer, has pledged to reduce its levels of planet heating pollution to 55% below 1990 levels by 2030.  “But you cannot have a green shift that violates human rights or Indigenous rights,” said Jåma. “These constructions threaten our way of living and our way of engaging in our culture as reindeer herders.”  Sámi reindeer herder Nils Mathis Sara follows a herd of reindeer on the Finnmark Plateau, Norway.Stoyan Nenov/Reuters/FILEJåma calls what’s happening “green colonization,” a term the Norwegian government told CNN was “misleading and incorrect.”  Steve Trent, CEO and Founder of the Environmental Justice Foundation, told CNN: “The Sámi did not cause the climate crisis, and their traditional ways of life - which they have practiced for millennia - should not be jeopardized by efforts to resolve it.”   “Our efforts to roll back global heating must be equitable and fair,” he added.   The Sámi people, whose traditional lands – Sapmi – span northern parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia, already live on the frontline of the climate crisis.   The Arctic is warming as much as four times faster than the rest of the world and the temperature changes are making it harder for reindeer to feed, as increased rainfall means layers of ice freeze over their food.   “Indigenous Peoples are asked to give up their lands for the wind industry, mining, and other purposes to save the world from a crisis mainly created by others,” Larsen said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indonesia's President Joko Widodo at last year's G20 Leaders Summit in Indonesia. Willy Kurniawan/ReutersNew DelhiCNN      Foreign ministers from the world’s biggest economies convened in New Delhi Thursday in what was seen as a grand test for Indian diplomacy, which ultimately didn’t succeed in reaching a consensus because of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.   In the second high-level ministerial meeting under India’s Group of 20 (G20) presidency this year, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, met his American, Chinese and Russian counterparts, hoping to find enough common ground to deliver a joint statement at the end of the summit.   But amid festering divisions over Moscow’s war, New Delhi was unable to convince the leaders to put their differences aside, with Jaishankar admitting the conflict had struggled to unite the group.   India, the world’s largest democracy with a population of more than 1.3 billion, has been keen to position itself as a leader of emerging and developing nations – often referred to as the Global South – at a time when soaring food and energy prices as a result of the war are hammering consumers already grappling with rising costs and inflation.   Those sentiments were front and center during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opening remarks earlier Thursday, when he spoke of multiples crises the world faces, with less wealthy nations hit especially hard.   “The experience of the last few years, the financial crisis, climate change, the pandemic, terrorism and wars clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said.   “We must also admit that the tragic consequences of this failure are being faced most over by the developing countries,” who he says are most affected by global warming “caused by richer countries”.   Eluding to the war in Ukraine, Modi acknowledged the conflict was causing “deep global divisions.” But he encouraged the foreign ministers to put differences aside during their meeting Thursday.   “We should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can,” he said.

Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the summit, according to a State Department official traveling with Blinken.  Blinken and Lavrov spoke for roughly 10 minutes, the same official said.  Russian Ministry of Foreign affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but played down its significance.  “Blinken asked for contact with Lavrov. On the go, as part of the second session of the twenty, Sergey Viktorovich (Lavrov) talked. There were no negotiations, meetings, etc,” she said.  Deep disagreements over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine played out in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru last month as well, when G20 finance chiefs failed to agree on a statement after their meeting.   Both Russia and China declined to sign the joint statement, which criticized Moscow’s invasion. That left India to issue a “chair’s summary and outcome document” in which it summed up the two days of talks and acknowledged disagreements.  Analysts say that throughout the war New Delhi has deftly balanced its ties to Russia and the West, with Modi emerging as a leader who has been courted by all sides.   But as the war enters its second year, and tensions continue to rise, pressure could mount on countries, including India, to take a firmer stand against Russia – putting Modi’s statecraft to the test. India’s balancing actArguably India’s most celebrated event of the year, the G20 summit has been heavily promoted domestically, with sprawling billboards featuring Modi’s face plastered across the country. Roads have been cleaned and buildings freshly painted ahead of the dignitaries’ visit.   Taking place in the “mother of democracies” under Modi’s leadership, his political allies have been keen to push his international credentials, portraying him as a key player in the global order.  Last year’s G20 leaders’ summit in Bali, Indonesia, issued a joint declaration that echoed what Modi had told Russian President Vladimir Putin weeks earlier on the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan.  “Today’s era must not be of war,” it said, prompting media and officials in India to claim India had played a vital role in bridging differences between an isolated Russia and the United States and its allies.

Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesIndia, analysts say, prides itself on its ability to balance relations. The country, like China, has refused to condemn Moscow’s brutal assault on Ukraine in various United Nations resolutions. Rather than cutting economic ties with the Kremlin, India has undermined Western sanctions by increasing its purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer.  But unlike China, India has grown closer to the West – particularly the US – despite ties with Russia.  New Delhi’s ties with Moscow date back to the Cold War, and the country remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for military equipment – a vital link given India’s ongoing tensions with China at its shared Himalayan border.  The US and India have taken steps in recent months to strengthen their defense partnership, as the two sides attempt to counter the rise of an increasingly assertive China.

So when and if Putin wishes to come to the table to negotiate, he will have no shortage of diplomats hoping to help,” he said.  Still, as Putin’s aggression continues to throw the global economy into chaos, India has signaled an intention to raise the many concerns faced by the global South, including climate challenges and food and energy security, according to Modi’s opening speech earlier Thursday.   “The world looks upon the G20 to ease the challenges of growth, development, economic resilience, disaster resilience, financial stability, transnational crime, corruption, terrorism, and food and energy security,” Modi said.Navigating tensionsWhile Modi’s government appears keen to prioritize domestic challenges, experts say these issues could be sidelined by the tensions between the US, Russia and China, which have increased recently over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.  Speaking to reporters last week, Ramin Toloui, the US assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, said while Secretary of State Antony Blinken would highlight its efforts to address food and energy security issues, he would also “underscore the damage that Russia’s war of aggression has caused.”  Blinken will “encourage all G20 partners to redouble their calls for a just, peaceful, and lasting end to the Kremlin’s war consistent with UN Charter principles,” Toloui said.   At the same time, Russia in a statement Wednesday accused the US and the European Union of “terrorism,” stating it was “set to clearly state Russia’s assessments” of the current food and energy crisis.   “We will draw attention to the destructive barriers that the West is multiplying exponentially to block the export of goods that are of critical importance to the global economy, including energy sources and agricultural products,” Russia said, hinting at the difficulties New Delhi might face during the meeting.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP)Sean Kilpatrick/APG20's criticism of Russia shows the rise of a new Asian power. And it isn't ChinaIndia has “worked very hard not to be boxed into one side or the other,” Markey said. The country could not “afford to alienate Russia or the US and Modi doesn’t want discussion of the war to force any difficult decisions or to distract from other issues, like green, sustainable economic development,” he added.   But with plummeting ties between Washington and Beijing after the US military shot down what it says was a Chinese spy balloon that flew over American territory, New Delhi will have to carefully drive difficult negotiations between conflicting viewpoints.   China maintains the balloon, which US forces downed in February, was a civilian research aircraft accidentally blown off course, and the fallout led Blinken to postpone a planned visit to Beijing.  As differences played out during the ministerial meeting Thursday, analysts say while India will be disappointed at the outcome, they were in a very difficult position to begin with.   “It will be a disappointment for Modi, but not one that cannot be managed,” Markey said. “Nor would it be India’s fault, as it would primarily be a reflection of the underlying differences over which Modi has very little control.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Here’s what you need to know    			By Rob Picheta, CNN		  Updated  5:42 AM EST, Thu March 2, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackWagner Group propaganda video: Recruits will be 'in good shape for the upcoming WW3'    02:16   - Source:CNNCNN      Russian forces are edging closer and closer to capturing the city of Bakhmut, after weeks of bloody fighting gradually wore down a resolute Ukrainian resistance.  Bakhmut is not the sort of city Moscow had hoped to be fighting for in the second year of its invasion – it is a relatively small location in eastern Donetsk, which has remained out of reach of Russia’s sluggish ground campaign for many months.  But its capture would represent some military progress for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and give his forces the opportunity to launch aerial attacks on more urban areas further west.  Here’s what you need to know about the battle for Bakhmut.Why is Bakhmut in focus?Ukraine’s biggest challenge at this moment is defending Bakhmut, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly video message Tuesday.   Russian forces have been making incremental gains around the city, but Ukrainian forces are yet to retreat, creating a standoff that recalls drawn-out battles for other eastern cities such as Severodonetsk over the past year.  On Saturday, Land Forces of Ukraine said on its Telegram channel that “the enemy keeps trying to break through the defenses and take Bakhmut” and that the commander of Ukraine’s Eastern Military Group, Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, had visited units that are defending the city and its approaches.  Alexander Rodnyansky, an economic adviser to Zelenksy, told CNN on Tuesday that “the situation is difficult. There is no secret about that.”   Bakhmut's buildings have been hit by relentless Russian strikes.Alex Babenko/Reuters“Russia is trying to encircle it right now and they’re using their best Wagner troops, apparently, the most well trained and experienced,” the adviser added. “Our military is obviously going to weigh all of the options. So far, you know, they’ve held the city, but, if need be, they will strategically pull back because we’re not going to second guess all of our people just for nothing.”  The Ukrainian military has also confirmed that Russian forces are employing more experienced fighters from the ranks of the Russian private military company Wagner as they attempt to capture the town.What’s happening on the ground?There are still around 4,500 civilians in Bakhmut, including 48 children, as Russian forces continue to advance on the city, the spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Donetsk regional military administration Tetiana Ignatchenko told CNN on Wednesday.  She called on people to evacuate the city due to the danger but said they had enough supplies.  “There is food, water and medicine in the city. People were provided with everything in advance,” Ignatchenko said. “Still, everyone has to leave. The situation is extremely dangerous for civilians.  Ukrainians watch a movie on TV at a humanitarian aid centre in Bakhmut on Monday, amid waves of Russian attacks on the city.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesA soldier from Ukraine’s 93th Brigade says his country’s forces are still standing in Bakhmut, with no plans for a retreat.  “We are standing in Bakhmut. No one is going to retreat yet,” the soldier said a video posted by the Ukrainian military on Wednesday. “We are standing. Bakhmut is Ukraine.”  The soldier also claimed the situation in Bakhmut was a bit calmer than in previous days.  “We have muffled the enemy down a little bit. It’s a little calmer, but there are still gunfights on the outskirts,” he said. “There are isolated explosions, bombs are flying.”  But Ukrainian troops have acknowledged that it is becoming harder to hold onto the city as the routes in from the west are squeezed by Russian forces, who have advanced both to the north and south of Bakhmut.   “The situation in Bakhmut is very difficult now. It is much worse than officially reported,” a soldier who didn’t want to be named told CNN on Tuesday. “In all directions. Especially in the northern direction, where the (Russians) have made the biggest advance between Berkhivka and Yahidne.”What does Bakhmut mean for the war?The city sits towards the northeast of the Donetsk region, about 13 miles from Luhansk region, and has been a target for Russian forces for months. Since last summer the city has been a stone’s throw from the front lines, so its capture would represent a long sought-after success for Moscow’s forces – and bring some limited strategic value.  The city has important road connections to other parts of the Donetsk region; eastwards to the border with Luhansk, north-west to Sloviansk and south-west to Kostiantynivka.   For several weeks the routes into Bakhmut have gradually come under the control of Russian forces. Rather than drive directly towards the city center, Wagner groups have sought to encircle the city in a wide arc from the north. In January they claimed the nearby town of Soledar, and have since taken a string of villages and hamlets north of Bakhmut.  If the Russians can take the high ground to the west of the city, nearby industrial towns Kostiantynivka and Kramatorsk would be at the mercy of their artillery and even longer range mortars. And it is unclear where exactly Ukrainian forces would fall back to should they retreat from the city.  But experts say capturing Bakhmut is unlikely to dramatically alter the overall picture of the war in eastern Ukraine, where little territory has changed hands in 2023. And it would in some ways signal the overriding failures of Russia’s invasion that, early in its second year, the capture of a relatively small city has required such a long and costly assault.Why does Putin want it?While Bakhmut’s strategic importance should not be overstated, its capture could still carry a very welcome symbolic impact for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  When Russian troops took the town of Soledar in mid-January, it marked a first gain in the Donbas for months. Six weeks on, the capture of Bakhmut would represent the completion of the next step.   It matters too to oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who runs the Wagner group and has frequently criticized the Russian Defense Ministry’s management of the “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine.  A Ukrainian flag flies in a damaged residential area in the city of Borodianka, northwest of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. In Borodyanka in the Kiev region, rescuers pulled out the bodies of 41 dead from under the rubble. This was reported by the press center of the State Service of Ukraine for Emergency Situations.

After months in which the Russian Ministry of Defense delivered nothing but retreat, Prigozhin has been keen to show his men can deliver with the seizure of Soledar and now Bakhmut.  Nonetheless, urgent questions will remain for Putin even if his forces pull off a successful assault on Bakhmut.  “The specter of limitless Russian manpower is a myth. Putin has already been forced to make difficult and suboptimal choices to offset the terrible losses his war has inflicted on the Russian military, and he will face similarly difficult choices in 2023 if he persists in his determination to use military force to impose his will on Ukraine and the West,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank wrote on Sunday in an update on the state of Russian forces and firepower.  “Russia can mobilize more manpower, and Putin will likely do so rather than give up. But the costs to Putin and Russia of the measures he will likely need to take at this point will begin to mount rapidly,” the ISW wrote.

Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday for the first time since the war in Ukraine began more than a year ago.  The brief contact on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in New Delhi marks a significant moment as high-level engagements between the United States and Russia have become exceedingly rare since the start of the war last February.   Blinken and Lavrov’s meeting comes amid some of the most heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow in decades.  Their conversation took place not only against the backdrop of the ongoing war – and stern warnings to the Chinese about materially supporting Russia’s conflict – but also amid deteriorating bilateral relations. Moscow has suspended its participation in the New START Treaty, the only remaining nuclear arms control agreement between Russia and the US, and it continues to hold American Paul Whelan in what the State Department has deemed as wrongful detention.  Blinken raised those three key issues – the war, New START, and Whelan – in his roughly 10-minute-long engagement with Lavrov, according to a State Department official traveling with the top US diplomat. Blinken was the one to initiate the conversation, the official and Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova both said.  However, the official noted that there aren’t high expectations the meeting will lead to a breakthrough on key issues of tension between the countries.  “I wouldn’t say that coming out of this encounter there was any expectation that things will change in the near term,” the State Department official told the traveling press.‘End this war of aggression’Blinken said he called on Russia to “end this war of aggression” and “engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace.”  “President Zelensky has put forward a 10 point plan for a just and durable peace. The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis,” Blinken said at a press conference later Thursday in Delhi.  “President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there’s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts and I quote ‘the new territorial realities,’ while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.”  The top US diplomat said the message calling on Moscow to cease its war echoed “what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations and what so many G 20 Foreign Ministers said today.”  At the newsconference, Blinken indicated that many of those foreign ministers had also on Thursday raised directly to China their concerns that Beijing will provide lethal assistance to Russia.  Blinken noted that “this is a shared concern” and reiterated that “this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China.”  “And I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions. So I’m not going to detail what they would be. But of course, we have sanctions authorities of various kinds. That would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at,” he said.‘Serious proposal’ to release Paul WhelanBlinken said that in his conversation with Lavrov, he “raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan as I have on many previous occasions.”  “The United States has put forward a serious proposal. Moscow should accept it,” he said.   Whelan, a former US Marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.  In December 2022, the US secured the freedom of another wrongfully detained American, Brittney Griner, in a prisoner swap, but US officials said that Moscow refused to accept the deal to release Whelan as well.   Whelan FamilyUS had 'direct conversations' with Russia on Paul Whelan since Griner's release, State Department saysElizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan’s sister, told CNN following Blinken’s exchange with Lavrov that “of course, we are pleased to see Paul’s case elevated in this manner, and take a great deal of comfort in the fact that the Secretary of State continues to press for a solution to Paul’s wrongful detention.”  David Whelan that the mention of his brother “at such a rare engagement between the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister” was appreciated.   “It reinforces our sense that the White House continues to advocate for Paul, even if we do not always see the activity,” he told CNN.‘Urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision’ on New STARTThe top US diplomat also “urged  Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision and return to implementing the New START treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation.”  Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would stop participating in the key arms control agreement, and signed a law formally suspending participation it in on Tuesday.  “Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries. It’s also what people around the world expect from us as a nuclear powers,” Blinken said.   “I told the foreign minister that, no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and Soviet Union did even at the height of the Cold War,” he added.  The brief sidelines engagement between Blinken and Lavrov was their first face-to-face encounter in more than a year. They last met in person in Geneva last January – just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.   Blinken and Lavrov were both present at several meetings together over the past year, but had not spoken with each other on those occasions.  And as recently as Wednesday, Blinken suggested he would not meet with his Russian counterpart at the meeting in the Indian capital.  “No plans to see either at the G20, although I suspect that we’ll certainly be in group sessions of one kind or another together,” Blinken said at a press conference Wednesday, referencing both Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang.  The two spoke by phone last July for the first time since the start of the war. In that “frank and direct conversation,” Blinken said he “pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.”    CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.

Video Ad FeedbackIsraeli-Palestinian tensions are mounting. Here's why    03:46   - Source:CNNSmotrich was asked Wednesday why he had liked a post on Twitter after the brothers were shot, but before the settler rampage, saying that Huwara should be erased.  “I think the village of Huwara needs to be erased,” he told a reporter at a conference run the Israeli business magazine The Marker. “I think the State of Israel needs to do this, and not – God forbid – private citizens.”  Price issued a strong condemnation from the US State Department podium Wednesday, saying, “I want to be very clear about this. These comments were irresponsible. They were repugnant. They were disgusting.”  “And just as we condemn Palestinian incitement to violence, we condemn these provocative remarks that also amount to incitement to violence,” he said at a State Department briefing.  Price also called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “and other senior Israeli officials to publicly and clearly reject and disavow these comments.”  “We condemn, as we have consistently, terrorism and extremism in all of its forms, and we continue to urge that there be equal measures of accountability for extremist actions, regardless of the backgrounds of the perpetrators or the victims,” he said.  Asked by CNN if he would condemn Smotrich’s comments following Price’s call for “senior Israeli officials to publicly and clearly reject and disavow these comments,” Israeli Ambassador to the US Michael Herzog said, “Notwithstanding the fact that Israel has been subjected to a recent wave of horrific terror attacks against its civilians, it is absolutely not Israeli policy and it’s against our values to respond by wiping out civilian villages.”  Smotrich is expected to visit Washington and New York City in March, but has no meetings planned with Biden administration officials, a source told CNN.‘Pogrom’The top Israeli general in the West Bank, Yehuda Fuchs, Tuesday night referred to the Israeli settlers’ actions as a “pogrom.”  Maj. Gen. Fuchs said Tuesday night that the Israel Defense Forces had not been sufficiently prepared for the revenge attacks that followed the killing of the Yaniv brothers in the town on Sunday.  “We did not prepare for a pogrom on the scale of dozens of people who come with incendiary devices… they go and set fire to random Palestinian houses, vehicles, etc. – simply  indiscriminate terror,” Fuchs said, in unusually blunt remarks by an Israeli military official criticizing Israeli settlers.

US Marines stand outside the Embassy of the United State of America in Havana, on February 21, 2018.Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images/FILECNN      The US intelligence community cannot link any cases of the mysterious ailment known as “Havana Syndrome” to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US, according to a US intelligence assessment published on Wednesday.  The latest conclusion comes years after the so-called syndrome first emerged and defies a theory that it could have been the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US.  The new assessment echoes an interim report from the CIA last year that found it unlikely that the “anomalous health incidents,” as they are formally known, were the caused by “a sustained worldwide campaign” by Russia or any other foreign actor.  Wednesday’s assessment also goes further in finding that there is no credible evidence that a foreign adversary has a weapon or collection device that is capable of causing the mysterious incidents, US intelligence officials said.   Officials also explained that the medical analysis has also evolved in a way that points away from adversarial involvement.  “I can share with you that most IC agencies have now concluded that it is ‘very unlikely’ a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs. IC agencies have varying confidence levels because we still have gaps given the challenges collecting on foreign adversaries – as we do on many issues involving them,” said Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.   The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including dizziness and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world, including clusters of at least 60 incidents in Bogota, Colombia and Vienna, Austria. There have been about 1,500 reported cases across the US government in 96 different counties including some cases reported this year, officials said Wednesday, but the number of reported incidents has dropped significantly in the last year.  The assessment, the result of the work of seven intelligence agencies, draws on the immense resources of the US intelligence community, including a review of hundreds of incidents and a wide range of factors surrounding them, officials explained. No definitive answers on causeWednesday’s assessment, however, does not provide definitive answers on or what caused the ailment that has sickened hundreds of US government personnel and family members worldwide.   There is no one explanation for these incidents. Instead, there are many different possible causes including environmental as well as social factors and preexisting medical conditions, officials said.   The assessment is likely to lead to further frustration among those impacted who have chastised the US government for not taking the condition seriously enough or slow-rolling the investigation.   “There is something counterintuitive to all of this. If doctors are diagnosing some of us with a qualified injury to the brain in the line of duty and we are not saying it was a foreign adversary, what was it from?” said one former CIA agency officer who experienced symptoms.  The intelligence community workforce was notified of the assessment on Wednesday, officials said. Sufferers were notified in recent days that the assessment was coming and some received a call from CIA Director Bill Burns, one source said.  In a statement, Burns said the assessment is “one of the largest and most intensive investigations in the Agency’s history,” stating that it “reflects more than two years of rigorous, painstaking collection, investigative work, and analysis by IC agencies, including CIA.”  “I want to be absolutely clear: these findings do not call into question the experiences and real health issues that US Government personnel and their family members – including CIA’s own officers – have reported while serving our country,” he said.‘Extremely aggressive’ investigationThe investigative efforts were “extremely aggressive” and involved “a high degree of risk,” one official explained. Intelligence officers vigorously studied what happened in the hours, days and weeks surrounding the incidents, the official explained.  In some instances they found malfunctioning HVAC systems, which can cause discomfort to humans, and in other cases there were computer mice that created surprising disruptions.   “We weren’t finding what we expected to find,” said one of the US officials. “There is no one explanation for any of this.”  There was also criminal activity that occurred around some of the incidents – such as the presence of weapons dealers. But when intelligence officials chased those leads – by looking into the criminals’ past, their family and their travels – they found no connection to the mysterious health incidents.   Officials even considered extraterrestrials as a cause, but found no linkage, they said.   Officials said that evidence pointed against foreign involvement, including citing “confusion” on the topic among key adversaries.    On the whole, officials did not find evidence to validate one of their incoming assumptions that one or more state actor was causing the incidents, they explained.  There is nothing to indicate that these incidents were the result of an insider attack, the officials said. The officials would not discuss if the US has a weapon that could have caused these incidents.   The findings also follow a report from a panel of experts last year – including scientists inside and outside of government – that found that “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source could have “plausibly” caused the mysterious incidents. While the latest intelligence assessment doesn’t count out that possibility completely, it appears to cast doubt on it by concluding that no US adversary has the plausible weapon or mechanism that would be needed for that to happen.   US officials said that one of the lessons learned from the investigation was that the US government needs to do a better job looking after the health and safety of the workforce.    Over the last year, the CIA and the State Department began providing compensation to victims whose symptoms required at least a year of medical assistance. Compensation efforts are “separate and distinct” from the intelligence assessment and will continue to be implemented, officials said.   Following the release of the assessment, administration officials were clear that support would continue.   “We are going to continue to see to it that our colleagues who report these incidents are treated with respect and compassion, receive timely access to medical care and we’ll continue to process Havana Act payments based on the eligibility criteria that’s been spelled out in the law,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.  However, the future of the US government’s probe into these incidents is a bit murky.   Officials would not definitively say if the intelligence community’s task force devoted to this effort would stay up and running, but Haines said that the work “will and must endure.” The Pentagon also has a team of experts that continues to investigate the matter.

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko meets with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing.Pavel Orlovsky/Belta/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko – a close ally of Vladimir Putin – vowed to deepen defense and security ties and expressed shared views on the war in Ukraine during a Wednesday meeting in Beijing, as geopolitical tensions around Russia’s war continue to rise.  Lukashenko endorsed China’s recent position on a “political solution” to the conflict, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout of the meeting, referring to a statement released by Beijing last week which called for peace talks to end the conflict, but did not push for a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine – drawing skepticism from Western leaders.  Both Xi and Lukashenko expressed “deep concern over the prolonged armed conflict” and looked forward to an “early return to peace in Ukraine,” according to a joint statement following their sit down in the Great Hall of the People, where Xi greeted Lukashenko in a ceremony alongside a phalanx of Chinese troops.  The visit from the Belarusian leader – who allowed Russian troops to use Belarus to stage their initial incursion into Ukraine last year – comes as tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent weeks, including over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.   Beijing has denied those claims and instead sought to portray itself as an impartial agent of peace – in contrast to the United States, who it has accused of “adding fuel to the fire” in the conflict and damaging the global economy with sanctions targeting Russia.  Speaking about the war in Wednesday’s meeting, Xi called for “relevant countries” to “stop politicizing and instrumentalizing the world economy” and act in a way to help “resolve the crisis peacefully,” in an apparent reference to the US and its allies.   The joint statement underscored the alignment between Minsk and Beijing when it comes to their opposition of what they see as a Western-led global order, with their joint statement including opposition to “all forms of hegemonism and power politics, including the imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions and restrictive measures against other countries.”   China and Belarus, which was also targeted in hefty Western sanctions following Russia’s invasion, would also bolster their cooperation across a range of economic areas, the statement said.   They also pledged to “deepen cooperation” on military personnel training, fighting terrorism, and “jointly preventing ‘color revolution’” – a reference to popular pro-democracy movements autocrats allege are backed by Western governments.

Kiichiro Sato/AP/FileBlinken's new warning to Beijing is the latest sign of deteriorating US-China relations    Tensions with the WestThe meeting, which Chinese state media described as “warm and friendly,” was the leaders’ first face-to-face since upgrading ties to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit last September in Uzbekistan, which Putin also attended.  “Today we will jointly set out new visions for the development of the bilateral ties … Our long-lasting friendly exchanges will keep our friendship unbreakable,” Xi told Lukashenko during the meeting, according to Chinese state media. He also endorsed Belarus in becoming a full member of the China and Russia-led SCO, where it is currently an observer state.  Speaking the same day from Uzbekistan, which is also a SCO member, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China “can’t have it both ways,” by “putting itself out as a force for peace in public,” while it continues to “fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.”  Blinken said that there are “some positive elements” of China’s peace proposal but accused China of doing the opposite of supporting peace in Ukraine “in terms of its efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war blocking and tackling for Russia.”   He also repeated Western concerns that China is considering providing Russia with lethal aid and later said he had no plans to meet with Russian or Chinese counterparts at a G20 meeting for foreign ministers scheduled to take place in New Delhi in India on March 2.  Lukashenko said he fully supports Beijing's ""recent"" security initiative days after it released a 12-point position on Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Belarusian PresidencyThe tightening of ties between Minsk and Beijing also comes alongside a years-long decline in Belarus’ relations with the West.  The former Soviet state was targeted by sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies in response to Moscow’s aggression after Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border north of Kyiv.  The European Union also does not recognize the results of Lukashenko’s 2020 election win – which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the country and were followed by a brutal government crackdown. The US has also called the election “fraudulent.”  There have been fears throughout the conflict in Ukraine that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another Russian offensive, or that Lukashenko’s own troops would join the war. Before visiting Moscow earlier this month, Lukashenko claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked.  Like China, Belarus has previously implied that the US does not want to see an end to the conflict.   In comments to reporters earlier this month before heading to Moscow to meet with Putin, Lukashenko maintained he wanted to see “peaceful negotiations” and accused the United States of preventing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from negotiating.  “The US are the only ones who need this slaughter, only they want it,” he said.

Her focus is on arms control, nuclear weapons policy issues and Russia-NATO relations. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. CNN      Easy to miss in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s speech to parliament last week was a glancing reference to the possibility of Russia resuming nuclear testing.   Marion Messmer Marion MessmerIn a surprise move, Putin said that Russia was ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the US conducted one first.  While most of the media focus has been on Russia suspending its participation in the New START nuclear arms treaty, this announcement was just as significant, with potentially devastating consequences.   It would signify a further step towards escalation in Ukraine by demonstrating Russia’s intent to use nuclear weapons and could begin another, more devastating, nuclear arms race.  Neither Russia nor the US have conducted a nuclear weapons test since the early 1990s – soon after that, they negotiated the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in Geneva – and although both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998, only North Korea has continued to test nuclear warheads since.   If Russia were to resume tests, other nuclear armed states might follow. North Korea would certainly take this as carte blanche for further tests and there would be concern in the US about potentially falling behind Russia in the development of new nuclear capabilities. All potentially leading to a new arms racing dynamic.

But by inserting this into his ‘State of the Nation’ speech, Putin appears to be creating a false narrative that the US is working towards a nuclear weapons test to justify Russia breaking the CTBT and once again conducting its own tests.   Indeed, the Russian news agency TASS reported in early February, days before Putin’s speech, that the Novaya Zemlya nuclear test site is ready to resume if needed. Why might Russia want to begin testing again? Firstly, as a signal of intent to ride roughshod over all nuclear agreements, demonstrating its capability and resolve – domestically and internationally – to use nuclear weapons.   And secondly, because Russia is developing new nuclear capabilities and has insufficient data without new warhead tests.   Neither reason is comforting. A Russian nuclear weapons test would shatter several decades of international agreements and any sense of certainty in non-proliferation efforts. The CTBT underpins the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by creating a credible premise that states will reduce their nuclear arsenals over time rather than continuing to expand.What would Russian nuclear weapons tests mean for other nuclear armed states?It would foment concerns in other nuclear-armed states that Russia can gain valuable insights from test data which they are currently missing out on.   This could lead to more states testing as they modernize their arsenals. In the US, some political figures would be likely to call for nuclear weapons tests, not wanting to be outdone by Russia or fall behind. A new nuclear arms race would emerge with several nuclear powers competing, amid few remaining treaty constraints.   Workers unload civilian bodies in a cemetery in Bucha, Ukraine on April 7, 2022.Rodrigo Abd/APOpinion: In Ukraine, a river of horrors has swelled to a flood By abandoning the CTBT and expanding its nuclear arsenals, Russia and any other states joining in a new series of tests would seriously damage the NPT. It is hard to see how it could recover from such a drastic departure of its central promise – that the five Nuclear-Weapon States will reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons – resulting in complete and irreversible disarmament.    It would also increase the potential of other states pursuing nuclear weapons again. South Korea has already hinted several times this year at investing in a nuclear program if the threat from North Korea does not diminish. A return to a global nuclear arms race may push them over the edge.  Nuclear testing could also be read as a signal of further escalation, demonstrating Russia’s resolve to use nuclear weapons in war or an escalation of the conflict between Russia and NATO. It would mean a step change from Putin’s rhetorical threats, to a dangerous reality which could easily spin out of control.What could be done if Russia was seen preparing for a test? A Russian nuclear weapons test would not come out of the blue. Intelligence services would be able to see preparations ahead of time. The US and the UK have been sharing regular defense intelligence updates since before the invasion of Ukraine, to signal to Russia that its motives are transparent and to help allies coordinate. They could use this same mechanism to draw attention to an upcoming test and to try to prevent it.  In such an event, the international community should work together to impress upon Russia its seriousness and coherence against a nuclear weapons test.A Russian nuclear weapons test would not come out of the blue. Intelligence services would be able to see preparations ahead of time. Marion Messmer  The response should be to immediately increase sanctions until Russia reverses any test preparations. The European Union should act more quickly on sanctions than it has previously. Knowing the risks, other states who so far have avoided taking a position might switch and join the transatlantic pressure on Russia.  China and India have a key role to play. So far, they have taken an ambivalent stance on Ukraine, abstaining on UN votes and refusing to condemn Russia outwardly. However, they have criticized its nuclear threats.   China has shown that it is not comfortable with such nuclear brinksmanship and equally does not want to see Russia or the US investing in expansion and development of their arsenals. Seeing such test preparations could see China threaten to withdraw its political and economic support for Russia, which would be a heavy blow to Putin’s military ambitions.What could be done if Russia conducted a test?By conducting a nuclear weapons test, Putin may well want to frighten Western states into no longer supporting Ukraine. However, it is far more likely that NATO member-states, worried about escalation, would simply double down on their support.   There are no good options in this scenario: a conventional response from NATO might also be an escalation. A change in nuclear alert levels would send a strong signal to Russia but could also provoke further escalation.   A new nuclear arms race would look different from that of the Cold War. It would no longer be largely a race between Russia and the US and would certainly include China – and have other regional nuclear dynamics implications.   In case of a Russian nuclear test, all other nuclear-armed states (with the exception of North Korea which would be unlikely to join) would need to stand together against nuclear testing and work to bring Russia back into compliance.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook History has several examples where the world came close to a devastating nuclear war and was saved by good fortune.

The mission — which is carrying two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and an astronaut from the United Arab Emirates — took off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida at 12:34 a.m. ET Thursday.  The Crew Dragon, the vehicle carrying the astronauts, detached from the rocket after reaching orbit, and it’s expected to spend about one day maneuvering through space before linking up with the space station. The capsule is slated to dock at 1:17 a.m. ET Friday.  Thursday’s launch marked the second attempt to get this mission, called Crew-6, off the ground. The first launch attempt was grounded on Monday by what officials said was a clogged filter.  During the launch broadcast, officials had reported that ground systems engineers made the decision to call off the launch with less than three minutes on the clock. The engineers said they detected an issue with a substance called triethylaluminum triethylboron, or TEA-TEB, a highly combustible fluid that is used to ignite the Falcon 9 rocket’s engines at liftoff.   The issue occurred during the “bleed-in” process, which is meant to ensure that each of the Falcon 9 rocket’s nine engines will be fed with enough of the TEA-TEB fluid when it’s time for ignition. The problem arose as the fluid moved from a holding tank on the ground into a “catch tank,” according to NASA.

The clogged filter explained the abnormal data engineers had seen on launch day, NASA said.   Benji Reed, SpaceX’s director of crew mission management, said that reviews of the data found that the rocket probably would have taken off without a hitch despite the clogged filter, though flight controllers didn’t have enough data during the countdown to be certain.   “That’s not how we want to launch people,” Reed said during a post-launch news conference on Thursday. “We want people know for sure that it’s going to be okay.”  The TEA-TEB system performed great on Thursday, officials said, though engineers did have to troubleshoot at least one irregularity after takeoff.  An issue cropped up with a sensor on one of six hooks that are used to hold the Crew Dragon’s nose cone, a cap on the top of the spacecraft that protects the ISS docking hardware during launch. But the Crew Dragon was able to use a back-up system to pop the nose cone open.  The hook is also used when the spacecraft latches on to the ISS, securing the vehicle to its docking port. But the sensor shouldn’t pose an issue because there are additional sensors to provide data, Reed said.  The Crew-6 astronauts waited aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Tuesday during the launch countdown, which was ultimately called off because of a ground systems issue.NASA    All about this launchThis mission marks the seventh astronaut flight SpaceX has carried out on NASA’s behalf since 2020, continuing the public-private effort to keep the orbiting laboratory fully staffed.  The Crew-6 team on board includes NASA astronauts Stephen Bowen, a veteran of three space shuttle missions, and first-time flyer Warren “Woody” Hoburg, as well as Sultan Alneyadi, who is the second astronaut from the UAE to travel to space, and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.  Once Bowen, Hoburg, Fedyaev and Alneyadi are on board the space station, they’ll work to take over operations from the SpaceX Crew-5 astronauts who arrived at the space station in October 2022.  They’re expected to spend up to six months on board the orbiting laboratory, carrying out science experiments and maintaining the two-decade-old station.  The mission comes as the astronauts currently on the space station have been grappling with a separate transportation issue. In December, a Russian Soyuz spacecraft that had been used to transport cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio to the space station sprang a coolant leak. After the capsule was deemed unsafe to return the astronauts, Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, launched a replacement vehicle on February 23. It arrived at the space station on Saturday.What they’ll do in spaceDuring their stint in space, the Crew-6 astronauts will oversee more than 200 science and tech projects, including researching how some substances burn in the microgravity environment and investigating microbial samples that will be collected from the exterior of the space station.

The first is the Boeing Crew Flight Test, which will mark the first astronaut mission under a Boeing-NASA partnership. Slated for April, the flight will carry NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams to the space station, marking the last phase of a testing and demonstration program Boeing needs to carry out to certify its Starliner spacecraft for routine astronaut missions.  Then, in May, a group of four astronauts are scheduled to arrive on Axiom Mission 2, or AX-2 for short — a privately funded spaceflight to the space station. That initiative, which will deploy a separate SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, will have as its commander Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut who is now a private astronaut with the Texas-based space company Axiom, which brokered and organized the mission.  It will also include three paying customers, similar to Axiom Mission 1, which visited the space station in April 2022, including the first astronauts from Saudi Arabia to visit the orbiting laboratory. Their seats were paid for by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Working with the RussiansRussian cosmonaut Fedyaev joined the Crew-6 team as part of a ride-sharing agreement inked in 2022 between NASA and Roscosmos. The agreement aims to ensure continued access to the space station for both Roscosmos and NASA: Should either the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule or the Russian Soyuz spacecraft used to transport people there experience difficulties and be taken out of service, its counterpart can handle getting astronauts from both countries to orbit.  This flight marks Fedyaev’s first mission to space.  Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions spurred by its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia remains the United States’ primary partner on the space station. Officials at NASA have repeatedly said the conflict has had no impact on cooperation between the countries’ space agencies.  “Space cooperation has a very long history, and we are setting the example of how people should be living on Earth,” Fedyaev said during a January 24 news briefing.  Bowen, the 59-year-old NASA astronaut who will serve as Crew-6 mission commander, also weighed in.

Kim Shiflett/NASA“I’ve been working and training with the cosmonauts for over 20 years now, and it’s always been amazing,” he said during the briefing. “Once you get to space it’s just one crew, one vehicle, and we all have the same goal.”  Bowen grew up in Cohasset, Massachusetts, and studied engineering, obtaining an bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the United States Naval Academy in 1986 and a master’s degree in ocean engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in 1993.  He also completed military submarine training and served in the US Navy before he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2000, becoming the first submarine officer to be chosen by the space agency.  He previously completed three missions between 2008 and 2011, during NASA’s Space Shuttle Program, logging a total of more than 47 days in space.  “‘I’m just hoping my body retains the memory from 12 years ago so I can enjoy it,” Bowen said of the Crew-6 launch.Meet the rest of the Crew-6 teamHoburg, who is serving as pilot for this mission, is a Pittsburgh native who completed a doctorate degree in electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, before becoming an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. He joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 2017.  Artist's conception of a large gas giant planet orbiting a small red dwarf star called TOI-5205.

I think back to six months ago and think — OK, that’s a long time,” Hoburg told reporters about his expectations for the journey.  But, Hoburg added, “I’m deeply looking forward to that first look out the cupola,” referring to the well-known area on the space station that features a large window offering panoramic views of Earth.  Alneyadi, who served as backup in 2019 for Hazzaa Ali Almansoori, the first astronaut from the UAE to travel to orbit, is now slated to become the first UAE astronaut to complete a long-duration stay in space.  In a January news conference, Alneyadi said he planned to bring Middle Eastern food to share with his crewmates while in space. A trained jiujitsu practitioner, he’ll also be packing along a kimono, the martial art’s traditional uniform.  “It’s hard to believe that this is really happening,” Alneyadi said at a news conference after arriving at Kennedy Space Center on February 21. “I can’t ask for more of a team. I think we are ready — physically, mentally and technically.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

In a restricted report seen by CNN, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity – which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb – had been found in Iran’s Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), an underground nuclear facility located some 20 miles northeast of the city of Qom.   The report says that in January, the IAEA took environmental samples at the Fordow plant, which showed the presence of high enriched uranium particles up to 83.7% purity.    The IAEA subsequently informed Iran that these findings were “inconsistent with the level of enrichment at the Fordow plant as declared by Iran and requested Iran to clarify the origins of these particles,” added the report.

(Photo DigitalGlobe via Getty Images)DigitalGlobe/Maxar/Getty Images/FILEIran’s stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had also grown from 25.2 kg to 87.5 kg since the last quarterly report, according to the confidential IAEA report.   ShutterstockTop US Defense official says Iran could produce 'one bomb's worth of fissile material' in 'about 12 days'The IAEA report said discussions with Iran to clarify the matter are ongoing, noting that “these events clearly indicate the capability of the IAEA to detect and report changes in the operation of nuclear facilities in Iran.”   In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian did not directly respond to a question on reports of the enrichment.   Amir-Abdollahian said that the deputy director general of the IAEA, Massimo Aparo, had visited Iran on two occasions in the past weeks and that the IAEA’s director general Rafael Grossi has been invited to visit the country.     “We have a roadmap with the IAEA. And on two occasions, Mr. [Massimo] Aparo, Mr. [Rafael] Grossi’s deputy, came to Iran in the past few weeks, and we had constructive and productive negotiations. And we have also invited Mr. Grossi to come and visit Iran soon,” Amir-Abdollahian told CNN.  “Therefore our relationship with the IAEA is on its correct, natural path.”  Last year, Iran removed all of the IAEA equipment previously installed for surveillance and monitoring activities related to the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).   The move had “detrimental implications for the IAEA’s ability to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” the IAEA report stated.

(Photo by Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesIran's amassed enough material for 'several nuclear weapons,' says IAEA chiefA US State Department spokesperson on Tuesday said the IAEA report potentially poses a “very serious development.”   “We are in close contact with our allies and partners in Europe and the region as we await further details from the IAEA on this potentially very serious development,” added the spokesperson.    Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl on Tuesday said that “Iran’s nuclear progress since” the Trump administration withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal “has been remarkable,” adding that in 2018, when the US withdrew, “it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one fissile, one bomb’s worth of fissile material.”  “Now it would take about 12 days,” he said.  More than a year of indirect negotiations between the US and Iran to try to restore the 2015 nuclear deal broke down in September 2022. Tensions between the two countries only worsened after Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests at home, and as Tehran supplied Russia with drones in the Ukraine war.   Kahl said Tuesday that the agreement is “on ice.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Greece train collisionAt least 36 people were killed in a train collision Tuesday night in Tempi, central Greece, the Greek Fire Service said. A passenger train was carrying more than 350 people when it collided with a freight train. The two trains involved in the collision were traveling on the same track for many kilometers before the incident occurred, state-owned public broadcaster ERT reported. The passenger train had changed lanes and switched to a cargo track before the collision, according to ERT. The passenger train had been traveling from the capital Athens to Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city, following a nationwide carnival that took place over the weekend.2. Ohio toxic trainScientists say tests in East Palestine, Ohio, show unusually high levels of some chemicals in the aftermath of a toxic train wreck last month. Nine of the dozens of chemicals that the EPA has been monitoring are higher than would normally be found in the area, according to a group of scientists from Texas A&M and Carnegie Mellon University. The highest levels found in the area were of a toxic chemical called acrolein, the analysis says. Acrolein is used to control plants, algae, rodents and microorganisms. It can cause inflammation and irritation of the skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes, according to the CDC. In response to angry residents, the EPA said it will continue to monitor the air quality in the area and in people’s homes.

Chicago mayorChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot lost her reelection bid Tuesday, marking the first time in more than 30 years that Chicago has ditched its mayor. Lightfoot, the first Black woman and first out gay person to serve as the city’s mayor, failed to make a top-two runoff amid growing concerns about rising crime in Chicago. Paul Vallas, a longtime public schools chief who ran on a tough-on-crime message, and Brandon Johnson, a Cook County commissioner backed by progressives and the Chicago Teachers Union, will advance to the April runoff, CNN projects. More than 507,000 ballots had been cast by the time polls closed Tuesday, Chicago elections officials said. More mail-in votes will be added to that total as they arrive.4. RSV vaccineVaccine advisers to the FDA narrowly voted Tuesday in favor of Pfizer’s RSV vaccine for adults over the age of 60, paving the way for approval of the nation’s first RSV vaccine, despite some safety concerns. The committee members voted 7-4, with one abstention, that there are adequate data to support the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of a lower respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, among older adults. The FDA, which typically follows the independent committee’s recommendations, is scheduled to decide on approval by May, ahead of RSV’s typical winter surge. RSV is a highly contagious virus responsible for an estimated 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths per year among adults 65 or older, according to the CDC.   Video Ad FeedbackDoctor explains what RSV symptoms to look for    01:45   - Source:CNN    5. UkraineRussian officials today accused Ukraine of launching a spate of attempted drone strikes targeting infrastructure deep inside Russia, including near its capital. Following the alleged attacks, Russia’s second-largest city of St. Petersburg closed its airspace and briefly banned incoming flights on Tuesday, according to state media. Meanwhile, Finland has begun construction of barrier fences on its eastern border with Russia. The Finnish border was one of the few entry points for Russians after many Western countries shut their air space and borders to Russian planes in response to the Ukraine invasion. Helsinki later closed its border at the end of last September when Russians tried to flee President Vladimir Putin’s “partial mobilization” of hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in the war.

Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko arrives in Beijing on February 28, 2023. Maxim Gucheck/BELTA/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      A key autocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in China for a state visit on Tuesday, amid warnings from United States officials that Beijing may be considering aiding Moscow in its ongoing assault on Ukraine.   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will stay in China until Thursday and meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss a range of issues from trade and investment to “acute international challenges,” Belarus’ state news agency Belta reported Tuesday after confirming the leader’s arrival.  His trip comes after the two leaders agreed to upgrade their countries’ ties to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” during a September meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Uzbekistan, which Putin also attended.  Lukashenko met with outgoing Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday and called for the two countries to “intensify” their relations, according to a readout from the Belarusian government.  “We have no closed topics for cooperation. We cooperate in all avenues,” Lukashenko told Li, per the readout, adding “we have never set ourselves the task of … working against third countries.”   Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday reported that Lukashenko visited Beijing’s Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath in front of the Monument to the People’s Heroes, which honors revolutionary figures in the Chinese Communist Party.  The visit from the Belarusian leader – who allowed Russian troops to use Belarus to stage their initial incursion into Ukraine last year – comes as tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent weeks, including over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.   In some of the most specific comments to date about the US response to any such support, Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a trip to Kazakhstan on Tuesday warned that Washington would target Chinese firms or citizens involved in any effort to send lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine.  Video Ad FeedbackReport obtained by CNN shows Russia is getting military support from China    04:37   - Source:CNNBeijing has pushed back on claims it is considering sending lethal aid, with its Foreign Ministry on Monday saying China was “actively promoting peace talks and the political settlement of the crisis,” while the US was “pouring lethal weapons into the battlefield in Ukraine.”  And despite its “no-limits” partnership with Russia, China claims to be a neutral party to the Ukraine conflict.  Jake Sullivan.Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesUS says China will face 'real costs' if it provides lethal aid to Russia for war in UkraineOn Friday, Beijing released a 12-point position on the “political solution” to the crisis in a document calling for peace talks to end the year-long war. Its release, however, was criticized by Western leaders, who accused China of already having taken Russia’s side.  Xi has yet to speak with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky since Russia’s invasion began, though he has spoken with Putin on multiple occasions, including in person during the SCO summit.  In an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua released ahead of his visit, Lukashenko is cited as saying the position paper was a testimony to China’s peaceful foreign policy and a new and original step that would have a far-reaching impact.  While burgeoning economic ties between China and Belarus are expected to be a key component of talks this week, the conflict in Ukraine will loom over discussions.  Video Ad FeedbackSee why Ukraine thinks Russia will launch new offensive from Belarus    03:05   - Source:CNNBelarus has been targeted by sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies in response to Moscow’s aggression after Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border north of Kyiv.   Belarus already had fraught relations with Western powers, with the European Union not recognizing the results of Lukashenko’s 2020 election win – which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the country and were followed by a brutal government crackdown.  There have been fears throughout the conflict in Ukraine that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another Russian offensive, or that Lukashenko’s own troops would join the war. Before visiting Moscow earlier this month, Lukashenko claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked.

Belarus was an early joiner of China’s Belt and Road development initiative, launched a decade ago, and trade between the two last year increased 33% year-on-year to surpass $5 billion, according to Xinhua.  In a call between Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and his Belarussian counterpart Sergei Aleinik on Friday, Qin pledged that China would “support Belarus in its efforts to safeguard national stability and development,” and “oppose external interference in Belarus’s internal affairs and illegal unilateral sanctions against the country,” according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout.  On Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a regular briefing that Lukashenko’s visit would be “an opportunity to pursue further progress in the all-round cooperation between the two countries.”    CNN’s Wayne Chang, Frederik Pleitgen, Zahra Ullah, Claudia Otto and Rob Picheta contributed reporting.

But even those who spend their days tracking its movement across oceans struggle to work out exactly who is ferrying it.   As Western sanctions against Russia have escalated over its invasion of Ukraine, more ships have joined an existing fleet of mysterious tankers, ready to facilitate Russia’s oil exports.  Industry insiders estimate the size of that “shadow” fleet at roughly 600 vessels, or about 10% of the global number of large tankers. And numbers continue to climb.  Who owns and operates many of these ships remains a puzzle. As trading Russian oil became more complex over the past year, many Western shippers withdrew their services. New, obscure players swooped in, with shell companies in Dubai or Hong Kong involved in some cases. Some bought boats from Europeans, while others tapped old, creaking ships that might have otherwise ended up in the scrapyard.  “You’ve gone deeper into the dark arts,” a senior executive at an oil trading firm told CNN, referring to this opaque network.  The under-the-radar fleet has increased in importance as Moscow tries to avoid working with Western shippers, and as customers in China and India supplant those in Europe, now banned from purchasing seaborne Russian oil and refined products such as diesel. Delivery to more distant buyers requires additional boats — and ship owners willing to deal with added complexity and legal risk, especially after Group of Seven countries imposed price caps on Russian oil.

Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe expansion of the shadow fleet highlights the dramatic changes Russia’s war has brought to the global oil market. In its bid to keep operating, the world’s second-largest crude exporter has reshaped decades-old trading patterns and split the world’s energy system in two.  “There’s the fleet that is not doing any Russian business, and then there’s the fleet that’s almost exclusively doing Russian business,” said Richard Matthews, head of research at EA Gibson, an international shipbroker. Only a few ships, he added, are doing a “bit of both.”‘Gray ships’ and ‘dark ships’As Europe has weaned itself off Russian energy, buyers in Asia have cut deals. China boosted imports of Russian oil to 1.9 million barrels per day on average in 2022, up 19% from 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. India ramped up purchases even more sharply, logging an 800% increase to an average of 900,000 barrels per day.   Russia’s oil exports to China and India both hit record highs in January after Europe’s ban on seaborne Russian oil took effect, according to Kpler, a data and analytics company. Exports to Turkey, another top customer, also continued apace. (The ban on refined oil products did not kick in until February.)  Filling these orders requires boats amenable to the trip. Russia’s national fleet doesn’t have enough vessels. That’s where the “shadow fleet” comes in.  Matthew Wright, senior freight analyst at Kpler, sorts the boats moving Russian crude into two categories: “gray ships” and “dark ships.” Gray ships have been sold since the invasion — mostly by owners in Europe to firms in the Middle East and Asia that weren’t previously active in the tanker market. Dark ships, on the other hand, are veterans of campaigns by Iran and Venezuela to avoid Western sanctions that have recently switched to carrying Russian crude.  “There is often some evidence that they have been disguising their activities by turning off their AIS transponder,” Wright said of the “dark” ships, referring to technology that helps identify and locate vessels.

VCG/VCG/Getty Images/FileChina is helping to prop up the Russian economy. Here's howWhile Western countries have banned most Russian oil imports, there aren’t any rules preventing Western ships from delivering to buyers such as China and India, or from providing services such as insurance — so long as the G7 price caps are respected. Ships with European owners accounted for 36% of Russian crude trade in January, according to Kpler.  But the legal and reputational risks of failing to comply with the price caps loom large. At the same time, Russia is eager to stop working with Western shippers. That has led to the development of a new cohort, whose makeup is murkier — and history more checkered.  “The dark fleet that has been around carrying Venezuelan and Iranian oil globally is something we all expected to grow, and it has,” said Janiv Shah, senior analyst at Rystad Energy, a consultancy.  One reason: Sending Russian oil on longer trips to China or India is less efficient than shipping it to nearby countries such as Finland. Russia now needs four times as much shipping capacity for its crude as it did before the invasion, according to EA Gibson.  As a result, an estimated 25 to 35 vessels are being sold per month into the shadow fleet, according to another senior executive at an oil trading firm. Global Witness, a nonprofit, estimates that a quarter of oil tanker sales between late February 2022 and January this year involved unknown buyers, roughly double the proportion the previous year.  Demand could increase in the coming months if China needs more fuel to power its economic recovery.Questions and risksIf a greater percentage of the global fleet is being used for Russian crude and petroleum products, that eats up capacity, raising costs for all oil traders.  “There’s been a massive increase in inefficiencies in the way the tanker market operates,” said Wright of Kpler.  There are also questions about who ultimately runs the shadow fleet. Some suspect a portion of the shell companies that have cropped up have ties to “the Russian state or certain politically connected players,” according to Sergey Vakulenko, a former executive at a Russian oil company, now nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The likelihood of there being a major spill or accident is growing by the day.”Richard Matthews, head of research at EA Gibson  This past weekend, the European Union imposed sanctions on Sun Ship Management, a subsidiary of Sovcomflot, Russia’s largest shipping company. The EU said the Dubai-based firm, registered a decade ago, had been “operating as one of the key companies managing and operating the maritime transport of Russian oil,” and that the “Russian Federation is the ultimate beneficiary” of its business operations.  Moreover, experts have said the shadow fleet may be easing Russia’s ability to dodge sanctions or sell its oil above the price cap. It’s also making it harder to discern exactly how much Russia’s barrels are selling for. Experts including Vakulenko have found evidence in customs data that Urals, the country’s benchmark, is selling for much more at key ports than official prices indicate.    Safety is also a worry. The dark fleet is believed to have a large contingent of vessels older than 15 years, the age at which mainstream oil companies would typically retire them due to wear and tear. Now, more of these boats are making trips across the globe.  “You’ve got all these old vessels that are probably not being maintained to the standard they should be,” said Matthews of EA Gibson. “The likelihood of there being a major spill or accident is growing by the day as this fleet grows.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Pickleball is America’s fastest-growing sport.

Wolf, CNN		  Published  5:58 PM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!   Fox News headquarters is pictured in New York City on January  20, 2021.Carlo Allegri/Reuters/FILEA version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

CNN      The painful truth about email and text messages, which every TV anchor and media executive should learn, is that you never know which message will be publicly released when your company is sued.  It’s especially painful if, as is the case for Fox News anchors and executives, the messages appear to show you are knowingly allowing false information on the air.   Lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems released portions of unflattering messages and depositions in court filings as part of their $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox for broadcasting conspiracy theories about Dominion’s role in the 2020 presidential election.  That’s how we know Tucker Carlson tried to get a Fox News White House correspondent fired for fact-checking former President Donald Trump’s false tweet about election fraud.  “Please get her fired,” Carlson texted to fellow Fox News anchor Sean Hannity. “Seriously … what the f**k? I’m actually shocked … It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It’s measurably hurting the company.” Green was the most important colorNote that he said company. The Fox leaders and top talent were focused on the company, not the country. Democracy was at stake, but the larger concern at Fox News appears to be that rival Newsmax was gaining traction after Trump lashed out at Fox News for his 2020 election loss.

Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesFox faces an 'existential threat' from its multibillion-dollar defamation casesFox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch didn’t mind the politics of putting the conspiracy theory-pushing MyPillow CEO on Fox News, he said in a deposition, according to court records.  “It is not red or blue, it is green,” Murdoch said, according to court documents.   Murdoch suggested firing the Fox News Washington bureau chief shortly after the network projected Joe Biden would win in Arizona, which had caught network anchors off guard and put the election all but out of reach for Trump.  Fox denies any wrongdoing and has accused Dominion of cherry-picking quotes for its filing.There’s a chicken or egg question in all of this Did Fox viewers question the election because of what they saw on the network, or did Fox allow election falsehoods on its air because it feared its viewers?  Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, who sits on the Fox Corporation board, sent an email to Murdoch about the circular false information loop – election deniers “got a diet of information telling them the election was stolen from what they believe were credible sources,” he wrote.‘Scared to lose viewers’Murdoch told Ryan in one email that Hannity had “been privately disgusted by Trump for weeks, but was scared to lose viewers.”  CNN’s Oliver Darcy has been all over this media story, which poses a real threat to Fox’s credibility, such as it is:   Read more about what we’ve learned from Dominion’s legal filing.Read about what the lawsuit should mean for Fox News in the future.But the epic unmasking of Fox News also speaks to the tectonic movements on the American right wing.  CNN’s Stephen Collinson puts it perfectly: “Fox News is the latest example of opinion formers on the right exposed for being held hostage to the fury they helped to incite. … The new details underscored how key players on the right feel they have no choice but to appease, satisfy and further inflame the voters and viewers on whom their profits or hopes of political power depend.”‘Going through a lot of churn’Darcy notes that Ryan was grilled by a conservative commentator last week over his decision to remain on the board of directors of Fox News’ parent company.   In the interview posted Tuesday on The Bulwark Podcast, Ryan said he believed Fox News is “gonna have to be a part of the solution if we’re going to solve the problem in the conservative movement.”  “Because there isn’t a bigger platform than this in America,” Ryan said. “So I think the conservative movement is going through a lot of churn and a lot of turmoil and I don’t like where it is right now.”  That churn among conservatives is more and more evident.What’s the Fox position on Ukraine? During the George W. Bush administration, Fox would have been a major backer of military aid for Ukraine if Russia had invaded as it did a year ago. That perspective is still evident on the network, where many guests talk about the importance of Ukraine aid.  But its top stars, like Carlson, are mimicking Trump and questioning whether the US should be opposed to Russia’s authoritarianism and invasion of Ukraine.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump’s current chief rival as they look ahead to the 2024 presidential race, represents the evolution in his own policy positions, as CNN’s KFile notes: “DeSantis wanted to send weapons to Ukraine when he was a congressman – as a presidential hopeful he questions US involvement.”  Skipping CPACTrump will appear this weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference, long a major stop for potential Republican presidential candidates. The other major announced candidate, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, will also attend.  But DeSantis, who is soft launching a nascent campaign, is skipping the event as he prepares promote his new book. He’ll also pop into a private retreat for the anti-tax Club for Growth in Palm Beach, Florida, where he can hobnob with donors, according to Politico.Failure to endorseTrump’s allies have been quietly trying to enlist hard-right lawmakers to back his third White House bid and give it some fresh momentum.   Perhaps surprisingly, they’re running into some walls.  CNN’s Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju interviewed two dozen or so lawmakers that Raju described as “hardcore Trump supporters, people who are part of the Freedom Caucus, people who were essentially his staunchest defenders during his four years in office.”  “Many of them are just not yet ready to commit,” Raju told CNN’s John King on “Inside Politics.”   They’re interested in DeSantis and even Haley and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott.  “The overriding concern among Republicans: They are concerned about Trump’s viability as a candidate,” Raju said. “After he underperformed in the last three election cycles, they’re worried that he could give Joe Biden another four years in the White House.”  Multiple members of the Freedom Caucus actually traveled to Florida not to meet with Trump, but instead to talk to DeSantis, according to Raju. They were impressed.  Rep. Ralph Norman told Raju the GOP has “the best stable of candidates ever,” and he is endorsing Haley, his fellow South Carolinian.  Norman said he hopes other Republicans back new candidates.  “It’s called democracy,” Norman said. “It’s called the political process. When is it bad to get behind a candidate that you believe in?”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

John Moore/Getty ImagesWashingtonCNN      The head of the US government watchdog for the war in Afghanistan said Tuesday that while there are a number of things the US could learn from the nearly 20-year conflict in Afghanistan and apply to the war in Ukraine, he’s not optimistic that officials will actually do so.  “I’m not super optimistic that we are going to learn our lessons … learning lessons is not in our DNA in the United States, unfortunately,” John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, told reporters at a Defense Writers Group event on Tuesday.  Sopko spoke with reporters the day after a SIGAR report was published outlining why Afghan security forces collapsed as the Taliban swept through the country in 2021, after years of the US focusing on equipping and training them.  The report comes as lawmakers in Congress have made clear they plan to hold additional hearings and further investigate the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.  A culture of silence has descended on Russia since it invaded Ukraine one year ago. But some Russians are tuning out from Putin's propaganda machine.Olga Maltseva/AFP/Getty Images'It's all a lie': Russians are trapped in Putin's parallel universe. But some want outSopko emphasized on Tuesday that Ukraine and Afghanistan are totally different countries and cultures. He added, however, that there are multiple opportunities for the US to apply lessons learned from Afghanistan to the war in Ukraine as the US continues assisting the country’s stand against Russia.  One of those is to establish oversight early, which appears to already be happening. The Pentagon’s inspector general told lawmakers on Tuesday that the Defense Department inspector general has completed five Ukraine-related oversight projects since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, and some 20 more audits are either planned or currently ongoing.  Officials also need to learn how to coordinate the different countries and agencies operating in Ukraine more effectively than they did in Afghanistan, Sopko said, and ensure that they don’t have unrealistic timelines. Ultimately, he said officials need to really understand the country they’re working in and their needs.  “Early on, we realized that we were building things in Afghanistan that the Afghans didn’t need, didn’t want, didn’t even know they were getting and couldn’t sustain,” Sopko said. “We have to make certain we go into Ukraine and listen to the Ukrainians on what they need, what they want, what they can sustain.”   But Sopko added that while he and his team have been approached by other countries to speak to them about their reports, and are aware of European countries doing their own studies, they have “not been approached by DoD, State, or USAID at a high level or official level to talk about any of these lessons we’ve learned.”  “How many people want to talk about Afghanistan at the Pentagon? How many people want to talk about Afghanistan at State, or AID? Not many,” he said. “And you know this report, with its companion report, is the only official US government report that’s public … on the 20 years spent in Afghanistan. To me, I’m very glad that we were able to do this, but I’m an inspector general. You would think the Department of Defense or Department of State or USAID or the National Security Council would have come out with something official on the 20 years there.”  He added that the Pentagon said it is working on an internal report regarding Afghanistan, but “how many years are we going to wait for that? I think the American people and Congress at least have a right to know what happened.”  This general view shows the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province on February 3, 2021, as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus, visit. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAssessment Covid-19 leaked from Chinese lab is a minority view within US intel community, sources sayThe report said that while SIGAR issued an interim version of the same report in May 2022, the Defense and State departments “declined to review that interim draft, denied us access to their staff, and mostly declined to answer requests for information.”  Included in Mondays’ report is a letter from a defense official earlier this month which says the Pentagon disagreed with SIGAR’s “suggestion that the United States did not adequately communicate to the Afghan Government its plans regarding the withdrawal of US forces.” The letter signed by Rebecca Zimmerman, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia, also says that her staff met with SIGAR after the interim report was published and offered “to continue to meet regularly … but the author did not follow up.”  But on Tuesday, Sopko doubled down, telling reporters that lawmakers were “outraged” over Defense and State’s lack of cooperation.  “When we talk about the lack of cooperation by DoD, we’ve got emails, and we’ve got memo traffic to support everything we said about their lack of cooperation,” Sopko said. “I know one nameless, faceless bureaucrat in the Pentagon said, ‘Oh, well, somebody came over once.’ No, no, we have the paperwork.”  The report released this week also provided an itemized list of the $7.2 billion worth of equipment that US forces left behind in the withdrawal, including Humvees, armored combat vehicles, drones, machine guns, sniper rifles, night vision devices and more.  At least some of that was destroyed or rendered unusable by US forces, Sopko said, but “a lot of it wasn’t.”    CNN’s Sam Fossum contributed reporting.

ShutterstockCNN      Iran could now produce “one bomb’s worth of fissile material” in “about 12 days,” a top US Defense Department official said Tuesday.Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl offered one of the most striking US government assessments to date of Iran’s “breakout time” as efforts to try to restore the Iran nuclear agreement remain halted and Tehran continues to breach the restrictions set out by the deal.  Kahl said that “Iran’s nuclear progress since” the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal “has been remarkable.”  A satellite image of the Fordow facility in Iran. DigitalGlobe/Maxar/Getty Images/FILENear bomb-grade level uranium found in Iranian nuclear plant, says IAEA report “Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA, it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one fissile, one bomb’s worth of fissile material,” Kahl said at a House Armed Services Committee hearing, using the acronym for the formal name of the deal: the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  “Now it would take about 12 days,” he said.  Biden administration officials have for months said that Iran’s breakout time – the amount of time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade material for one nuclear bomb – had dwindled to a matter of weeks. The breakout time does not mean that Iran could produce an actual bomb in that amount of time.  Kahl’s comments – set against reports of Iran’s continued enrichment of uranium in violation of the deal – present a striking picture of the challenges facing the increasingly defunct agreement.  In a restricted report seen by CNN, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity – which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb – had been found in Iran’s Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, an underground nuclear facility.  According to the confidential IAEA report, Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had grown by 25.2 kg to 87.5 kg since the agency’s last quarterly report.  “It is quite clear that Iran enriched uranium to near weapons-grade levels,” Kelsey Davenport, the Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, told CNN.  She said Tehran may have been “testing political responses to higher levels of enrichment or it was experimenting and it got caught,” noting that it underscores the rapid advancement of Iran’s nuclear program and the high risk of miscalculation.  KORENGAL VALLEY, AFGHANISTAN - OCTOBER 27:  U.S. soldiers board an Army Chinook transport helicopter after it brought fresh soldiers and supplies to the Korengal Outpost on October 27, 2008 in the Korengal Valley, Afghanistan.  The military spends huge effort and money to fly in supplies to soldiers of the 1-26 Infantry based in the Korengal Valley, site of some of the fiercest fighting of the Afghan war. The unpaved road into the remote area is bad and will become more treacherous with the onset of winter.  John Moore/Getty ImagesAfghanistan watchdog 'not super optimistic' that US will learn its lessons from Afghanistan to help UkraineDavenport also told CNN that Iran’s “significant increase” in its enriched uranium stockpiles is “a serious concern.”  “When Iran can rapidly produce enough weapons grade material for several bombs, the proliferation risk rises significantly,” she explained.  “This is an urgent proliferation crisis,” she said.  US officials have repeatedly said they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the matter, but have maintained that all options, including military ones, are on the table.   More than a year of indirect negotiations between the US and Iran to try to restore the deal broke down in September 2022, as the US accused Iran of making “unreasonable” demands related to a probe by the IAEA, which is the UN’s nuclear watchdog, into unexplained traces of uranium found at undisclosed Iranian sites.   In recent months, the administration has said the agreement is “not on the agenda,” in the words of State Department spokesperson Ned Price.   Kahl said Tuesday that the agreement is “on ice” in part because “Iran’s behavior has changed since then, not the least of which their support for Russia and Ukraine.”  This story has been updated with additional details.

Moscow region Gov. Andrey Vorobyov claimed a Ukrainian drone had crashed near the village of Gubastovo southeast of the capital. The drone was apparently aimed at what he called “civilian infrastructure,” later confirmed to be a gas facility operated by state-owned company Gazprom.  The facility remained undamaged, state media reported, citing the region’s Energy Ministry.   State media later posted a photograph of what it said was the crashed device, which appeared to resemble a Ukrainian-made UJ-22 attack drone.   The UJ-22 is relatively small and versatile, able to fly through poor weather and to travel up to 500 miles (800 kilometers). It’s unclear where or when the photo of the crashed drone was taken.  The crash was allegedly one of several attempted strikes, with state media reporting a drone was shot down near the Belarus border and the defense ministry claiming two more strikes were thwarted through the use of drone-jamming technology in the Krasnodar and Adygea regions.   “Both drones lost control and deviated from their flight path,” the defense ministry said in a statement. “One UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) fell in a field, and another UAV, deviating from the trajectory, did not harm the attacked civilian infrastructure facility.”  CCTV appears to show explosion in Russian city of EngelsFrom TwitterAttacks on Russian air bases put spotlight on new Ukrainian drone programAt least one drone appeared to have evaded Russian defenses, with footage posted on social media overnight and geolocated by CNN showing a fire at energy firm Rosneft’s oil depot in Tuapse, on Krasnodar’s Black Sea coast.   It’s unclear if the facility was the intended target, but Ukraine has previously targeted oil depots within Russian-controlled territory.  CNN is unable to independently confirm the claims for each alleged attack, and Ukraine did not immediately comment on the incident. Ukraine has previously declined to comment on attacks inside Russia.  Following the alleged attacks, Russia’s second-largest city of St. Petersburg closed its airspace Tuesday within a 200-kilometer (124-mile) radius, briefly banning incoming flights, according to state media.    Russian President Vladimir Putin had been briefed about the closures – but Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had declined to discuss whether it was related to the “incidents in St. Petersburg and Tuapse,” state media reported.December strikesAttacks targeting Russian infrastructure have focused attention on Ukraine’s efforts to develop longer-range combat drones.  In early December, Russia reported multiple attacks by Ukrainian drones targeting military infrastructure, including air bases that lie hundreds of miles inside Russian territory and beyond the reach of Ukraine’s declared arsenal of drones.Around the same time, Ukraine’s state-owned weapons manufacturer Ukroboronprom indicated that it is close to finishing work on a new long-range drone – though there is no public indication that such a device has been readied for deployment or was involved in explosions inside Russia.  The village of Zarichne, near Kreminna, has suffered in Russian shelling.Matthias Somm/CNN'The enemy is always looking for us': Hidden in the forest, Ukraine's drone operators are crucial to the eastern battleAt the time, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry offered no comment on the strikes – though a presidential adviser tweeted a cryptic message hinting at the possibility Kyiv was indeed behind the December attacks.  “The Earth is round – discovery made by Galileo. Astronomy was not studied in Kremlin, giving preference to court astrologers. If it was, they would know: If something is launched into other countries’ airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point,” he said at the time.

While GOP leaders are supportive of the move to release the footage – which was one of the many concessions McCarthy made in his bid to become speaker – some lawmakers in the closed-door leadership meeting asked whether sensitive security protocols or certain evacuation routes would be exposed by taking that step.   Others questioned how long the footage is going to be dragged out in the press, with some lawmakers concerned about the optics of appearing to try to downplay a deadly insurrection in the US Capitol.   “Let’s just rip the Band-aid off and get this over with,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN.  Sources said McCarthy assured his leadership team that he wants to move swiftly, but said they need to be deliberate about how they handle it to ensure the release does not endanger their security. He also told lawmakers that other media outlets will get access to the footage after Carlson airs his exclusive, but it could take a few weeks.  CNN, along with a group of other media organizations, has signed on to a letter calling for congressional leaders to grant access to the security footage from the riot.  A congressional source familiar with the matter said there were ongoing discussions with the Capitol Police about what restrictions should be placed on the footage and that it remained unclear exactly what limitations would be on the video that Carlson will be allowed to air. But even giving Carlson the video footage has spawned widespread concerns, given the conservative host has pushed conspiracy theories about the attack and downplayed the violence at the hands of Trump supporters.  House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York confirmed that the topic came up in their leadership meeting and said she fully supports McCarthy’s decision to publicly release the footage. She also said Republicans would ensure that law enforcement and security protocols are protected.  “Unlike Democrats, we do work very effectively with the Capitol Police. And we respect law enforcement,” Stefanik told CNN. “This is about transparency.”  McCarthy, who initially told reporters he would answer questions on Monday, left the Capitol and avoided reporters and questions about the matter. McCarthy defended his decision to publicly release the footage during a closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday morning, according to sources in the room.   McCarthy said the release was an important step in the name of transparency and argued that there wasn’t outcry when the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection showed clips at their public hearings of then-Vice President Mike Pence’s evacuation. That select committee never revealed Pence’s exact escape route but showed photos of him in the garage where he was hiding during the riot.  One of McCarthy’s closest allies, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene – who also has downplayed the January 6 attack – backed his decision to give the footage to Carlson. She told CNN on Monday she played a role in McCarthy’s decision, but she wouldn’t go into further detail.   Greene, who was not in the Monday night meeting, said she’s spoken with McCarthy, and that the speaker’s office is coordinating a process for how to release the footage more widely, beyond Fox News, while also ensuring it doesn’t violate any security concerns.   “We can’t give away our national security,” Greene said, “Everyone in Congress agrees. And I think the American people agree. We don’t want Russia or China or any of these other countries being able to study all the entries and exits of our capital. That’s foolish.”  Greene told CNN that Carlson’s team was also given certain parameters for what they could and couldn’t air. “Yes … of course (there were parameters) they’re being extremely careful and responsible.”   “I think it is any day now,” Greene told CNN of when to expect some of the footage to air on Fox News.  Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who urged the speaker to release the footage as McCarthy was courting his vote for the speakership, would not say if that was part of the commitment made to encourage him to vote “present” and help the California Republican’s cause.  “I think it’s getting released,” Gaetz told CNN of the security footage.  Top Democrats, too, are closely monitoring the matter.  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said he and McCarthy “have not had an extended conversation” yet about releasing the footage to Carlson.   “But I look forward to talking to him this week and further about figuring out an approach that makes sense and respects the security concerns that many members have articulated in the House,” Jeffries said of the speaker.  Top Democrats are waiting to see what footage is ultimately released before taking position on whether the full media should also have access to it, a source familiar with the matter said.  Asked if he believed the footage should be released widely to the media, Jeffries told CNN: “I have no comment on that right now.”  Other Democrats were outraged at the speaker.  Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chaired the select committee on January 6, told CNN that McCarthy “opened up a can of worms” by agreeing to release the footage to Carlson and dinged the California Republican for fundraising off the move, which he said puts “the institution at risk.”  This story has been updated with additional developments.CNN’s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.

In the most specific public admonition on the issue to Beijing so far, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken underlined that arming Moscow’s forces would cause China serious problems around the world.  “China can’t have it both ways when it comes to … the Russian aggression in Ukraine. It can’t be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand, while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand,” Blinken said in Kazakhstan.  US officials have spent the past 10 days warning that it has intelligence that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia, causing fury in Beijing and underscoring how already deteriorating diplomatic relations are being rocked by almost daily crises – from a recent spy balloon controversy to a revived dispute over the specific origins of Covid-19. On Monday evening, the White House gave federal agencies a 30-day deadline to remove TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, from federal devices. And later Tuesday, a new House select committee will hold its first hearing on the fast-widening US-China rivalry.  In his clearest comments about how the US would respond if China did decide to help its ally Russia with lethal aid, Blinken spoke of punishments for Chinese firms that could cause Beijing to pay an economic price.  “We did very clearly warn China about the implications and consequences of going through with providing such support,” referring to his own meeting with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in Munich this month and President Joe Biden’s talks with President Xi Jinping in Indonesia in November 2022.  “We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, or otherwise engaged in supporting the Russian war effort,” he said.   New confrontations – along with rising tensions between US and Chinese forces in Asia and escalating standoffs over Taiwan – are dramatizing a long-building and once theoretical superpower rivalry that is suddenly a daily reality.

Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAssessment Covid-19 leaked from Chinese lab is a minority view within US intel community, sources sayThis increasingly adversarial relationship touches multiple areas of American life – from the economy to public health. It spans the challenges faced by the US military, which are amid the great geopolitical clashes of the early 21st century like in Ukraine to risks posed by the Chinese-designed apps on the electronic devices everyone carries everywhere. It’s fueling the dangerous possibility that the US and China are locked into a potentially disastrous slide toward conflict. And it poses serious challenges for a polarized US political system that struggles to have a rational debate on these issues without descending into a partisan game of who can be tougher on China. Such one-upmanship only deepens a self-perpetuating cycle of escalation between the two sides.  It is in this politicized atmosphere that the GOP-controlled House is debuting a new bipartisan select committee on competition with China during a primetime hearing on Tuesday night, just as Washington-Beijing tensions have rarely been worse.  The committee’s work will be based on the premise that after years of trying to integrate China peacefully into the global system as a competitor not an enemy, the US is switching to a tougher stance in a belief that a new generation of Chinese leaders is trying to dismantle the US global order and international law.  Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, the new committee’s chairman, told CNN’s Manu Raju that Tuesday’s hearing would not focus specifically on the latest drama – after the Department of Energy assessed with low confidence that the Covid-19 pandemic originated with a lab leak in the Chinese city of Wuhan. He said that finding, which is a minority view among US intelligence agencies, could be examined in a future hearing but that he wanted to show Americans on Tuesday that the threat from China was “not just an over there problem, it’s … right here.”  WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 28:  Nicholas Burns, professor of the practice of diplomacy and international relations at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, testifies before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee June 28, 2017 in Washington, DC.

On CBS News on Sunday, Gallagher warned: “We may call this a strategic competition, but it’s not a tennis match. This is about what type of world we want to live in. Do we want to live in Xinjiang-lite or do we want to live in the free world?” he said, referring to the Chinese region where the US has accused China of inflicting genocide on the Uyghur minority, a charge China continues to vehemently deny.  The committee may be one of the few areas where a divided Congress – and potentially the White House – can find common ground. The Biden administration has reinforced the already tough stance toward China that ex-President Donald Trump adopted later in his presidency. Biden, for instance, last year signed a new law that will allow the government to spend $200 billion in a bid to claim the leadership of the semiconductor chips industry – a critical sector that could decide the economic race between the US and China in decades to come.Covid-19 origin controversy starts new pan-Pacific war of words The new controversy over the origins of Covid-19 is a study in isolation of many of the forces ripping at US-China relations, including US mistrust of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping’s desire to preserve his prestige and that of a political system he holds up as an alternative to Western democracy. US demands for information about the origins of the pandemic show how China is refusing to play by global rules – in this case, in allowing follow-up virological investigations. All of this only exacerbates intense reaction in Washington, and in turn tears at US political fault lines.   There is no consensus within the US government on the origins of the pandemic. Intelligence agencies remain divided over whether it started with animal to human transmission in a Wuhan wet market or originated in a viral leak from a Chinese laboratory – and no new evidence has emerged publicly in support of the lab leak theory. Investigating the origins is hugely important.   “There is a bottom line here, which is that neither lab leak, nor spillover – i.e. animal origin – can be ruled out. We don’t have definitive information,” Tom Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN on Monday.   Security personnel keep watch outside Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organization (WHO) team tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Wuhan, Hubei province, China February 3, 2021.Thomas Peter/Reuters/FileCovid 'lab leak theory': What we've learnedBut it didn’t take long for Republicans to claim political victory in the wake of Sunday’s Wall Street Journal report about new intelligence causing the Department of Energy to believe with low confidence that a lab leak was to blame. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been accused of spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, tweeted, “Conspiracy theorists - 100 Media - 0.”   Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas tweeted: “Re. China’s lab leak, being proven right doesn’t matter. What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn’t happen again.”  Such definitive statements, based on one assessment, do not recognize that the US intelligence community is still divided over the matter. Some Republicans have long sought to prove that the virus was a conspiracy by China to unleash contagion on the world, and many have long appeared to be seeking an explanation for the pandemic that could mask Trump’s negligence in handling it.  But even if the virus did emerge from a laboratory, it doesn’t mean it was necessarily man made or that the rest of the world was deliberately exposed.   China’s foreign ministry reacted angrily to the reemergence of the lab leak theory in Washington, warning that Americans should “stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin.”   In many ways, it doesn’t matter if poor security at a lab in China or animal transmission caused the pandemic that killed nearly seven million people globally, according to World Health Organization figures, and more than a million in the US. Both possible routes of transmission represent a threat to humanity and need to be addressed, which is one reason why China’s lack of transparency on the issue is so potentially dangerous. The pandemic remains a huge embarrassment for China, souring its national mythology of a mighty rising power.   But in Washington this week, the issue has again degenerated into an excuse for Republicans to target scientists and government health experts and to twist a narrative about Covid-19 that still has massive gaps.   The challenge for the new select committee, which is especially probing economic and technological competition with China, will be to break this cycle of politicization to provide a useful examination of US-China relations that could result in effective policy recommendations down the road.The US and China have a new area of confrontation – Ukraine Another example of how the wider antagonism between the United States and China is coloring other crises is evident with Ukraine.  The US, citing unpublished intelligence, has spent the last week warning that China is considering sending lethal aid to bolster Russia’s forces – a situation that would effectively put China on the opposite side of a proxy war with the US and NATO powers that have sent billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine.  Beijing has long amplified Russia’s justifications for the invasion, which took place a year ago shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to the Chinese capital to agree to a friendship with “no limits” with Xi. China would prefer Russia, which shares its autocratic form of government, not to suffer a total defeat in Ukraine – which could lead to the ousting of close ally Putin. And China increasingly tends to view its global interests through the prism of its standoff with the US, so it may perceive an advantage in Washington being locked in an arms-length conflict in Ukraine that is costing billions of dollars and to which it is sending reserve military equipment and ammunition that can therefore not be used to bolster its Pacific forces. Delays in procurement in the US arms industry caused by Ukraine could also slow the flow of weapons to Taiwan.   Yet a decision by China to throw in its lot with Russia in Ukraine would amount to a radical change in foreign policy – and another massive plunge in US-China relations. Washington and the European Union would certainly respond with sanctions on Chinese firms, a threat that will likely give leaders in Beijing pause, as the country’s economy slowly recovers from years of Covid isolation.  “China has never had to incur any costs for its support for Russia. This (would be) the first time – it is a very important crossroads,” Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, said on CNN Monday.   As with the latest Covid-19 drama, China has reacted angrily to US criticism – all of which it appears to view in the wider context of its belief that every US policy is aimed at depriving it of its rightful global influence.  This new front in US-China antagonism is also beginning to seep into US politics. While being tough on Beijing is a bipartisan position, the idea of a broadened conflict in Ukraine conflicts with the more limited view of US power projection abroad among “America First” Republicans. Traditional hawks like Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell strongly support even more US aid for Ukraine, but some conservatives like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – a likely 2024 contender – have warned against escalating conflict. In a rare foreign policy comment last week, he specifically mentioned potential Chinese involvement.  “I don’t think it’s in our interest to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the Borderlands or over Crimea,” DeSantis told “Fox & Friends,” referring to Ukrainian lands Russia has seized with military force.  His comments were a reminder that everything in Washington is ultimately political. And few issues are as politicized as tortured US relations with China.

Ron DeSantis’ new book, “The Courage to Be Free,” leans into the culture wars that established him as one of the early Republican favorites for the GOP nomination for the presidency.   While more sparse on biographical details than most political memoirs, the 256-page book offers some new insights into his upbringing, college years and military service. But mostly, DeSantis rehashes his contentious four years as governor and suggests he has laid a path for others to follow.   Broadside Books“The battles we have fought in Florida – from defeating the biomedical security state to stifling woke corporations to fighting indoctrination in schools – strike at the heart of what it means to be a Floridian and an American,” DeSantis writes.  The book’s release has coincided with the soft-launch of the Republican’s presidential campaign and it ends with a forward-looking note that alludes at the next challenge ahead.  “The Florida Blueprint is a simple formula: be willing to lead, have the courage of your convictions, deliver for your constituents, and reap the political rewards. This is a blueprint for America’s revival. We’ve shown it can be done,” he writes.  CNN obtained an advance copy of the book before its publication on Tuesday. Here are four takeaways:DeSantis (gently) pushes back against TrumpDeSantis largely avoids direct confrontation with former President Donald Trump, whom he praises for his “unique star power,” “massive following” and  “filling the void that GOP leaders had left by ignoring the preferences of their own voters.” He continued his defense of Trump’s 2016 campaign against investigations for Russian election interference.   But DeSantis expended considerable ink challenging Trump’s version of the 2018 Florida governor race to claim back credit for his victory.   Trump has claimed DeSantis “begged” for a gubernatorial endorsement in the Republican gubernatorial primary – shed tears even. Before Trump got involved, DeSantis was “dead” and “leaving the race,” the former president recently told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt.  DeSantis recalled asking Trump in late 2017 “if he would be willing to send out a tweet touting me as a good candidate for Florida governor.” Trump, DeSantis said, “seemed amenable, but at the same time, I was not holding my breath.”  Trump did tweet about DeSantis, calling him “a brilliant young leader” and playing up the then-congressman’s Ivy League credentials.   In DeSantis’ telling, he recognized the power of Trump’s endorsement, but suggested its appeal was limited.  “I do not think Republican primary voters are sheep who simply follow an endorsement from a politician they like without any individual analysis, but I do believe that a major endorsement can put a candidate on the radar of GOP voters in a way that boosts a good candidate’s prospects,” he writes.  DeSantis later says it was his debate performance, not Trump’s support, that led to a reversal in the polling. He omitted, though, that Trump had tweeted a more forceful “full endorsement” of DeSantis just two months before the primary. Nor did he note that Trump sent a team of Florida operatives to help DeSantis’ campaign after the primary.   Throughout the book, DeSantis finds more opportunities to undercut the former president. At several points, DeSantis bemoans the lack of activity in Trump’s first two years in office, when Republicans controlled the House and Senate. Though he doesn’t blame Trump explicitly, when juxtaposed against his own record compelling Republican lawmakers in his state to act repeatedly in service of his agenda, the implication seems clear.   “Here we had a unified Republican government for the first time in more than a decade, and yet so much of the time was frittered away on matters like the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump’s campaign had colluded with Russia, which GOP-led committees investigated for two years,” he writes. “Why Congress didn’t do more significant things, such as appropriating money to build the wall at the US-Mexico border, was beyond me.”Inside the feud with DisneyDeSantis’ book frames his battle with Disney as a demarcation line in his political story. It’s mentioned on the second page of the introduction. The juiciest excerpts from that particular chapter (which he labeled “The Magic Kingdom of Woke Corporatism”) were released in advance to Fox News. And, in a symbolic move, he signed the bill to remove Disney’s special governing powers Monday, the eve of his book’s release.   DeSantis’ views his own political feud with the company as somewhat ironic, given that he married his wife in Disney World. He also is quite clear that his wife, Casey, who hailed from “a family of Disney enthusiasts,” was the catalyst for the location of their nuptials.  “My only condition was that no Disney characters could be part of our wedding,” he wrote. “I wanted our special day to look and feel like a traditional wedding. I didn’t want Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck in our wedding photos.”  His relationship with Florida’s largest employer broke down last year as outrage intensified over a Florida bill to limit the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity. DeSantis recalled then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek told him during a phone call that he did not want to get the company involved but was under pressure to weigh in.   DeSantis urged Chapek to steer clear and suggested the blowback would pass in 48 hours once there is “some new outrage that the woke mob will focus on.”  “You will end up putting yourself in an untenable position,” he recalled telling Chapek. “People like me will say, Gee, how come Disney has never said anything about China, where they make a fortune?’”  Disney ultimately weighed in, saying in a statement that it was “dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.” And DeSantis pounced, as he said he would.  To DeSantis, the episode is a microcosm of a greater struggle between the fight conservatives expect from GOP leaders and the instincts of Republicans not to meddle in the affairs of businesses. DeSantis argues, “In this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand.”   “Unfortunately, the sad upshot of these changes is that corporate America has become a major protagonist in battles over American politics and culture. The battle lines almost invariably find large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes,” he writes. “It is unthinkable that these large companies would side with conservative Americans on issues such as the Second Amendment, the right to life, election integrity, and religious liberty.”DeSantis vs. DeSantisDeSantis’ first book, the little-read “Dreams from Our Founding Fathers” published in 2011, is a case for limited government, separation of powers, humble leadership and executive constraint. DeSantis’ latest book is a defense of his most contentious executive actions, achieved by consolidating power and flexing executive authority, in ways that suggest he has undergone an evolution of his previous principles.   In “The Courage to be Free,” DeSantis – the former star athlete and Naval officer – demonstrates a tactical precision for using his executive powers in ways intended to keep Democrats and the media off guard in pursuit of an aggressive and partisan agenda. He brought to the job, he writes, “an understanding of how a constitutional form of government operates, the various pressure points that exist, and the best way to leverage authority to achieve substantial policy victories.”  “One of my first orders of business after getting elected was to have my transition team amass an exhaustive list of all the constitutional, statutory, and customary powers of the governor. I wanted to be sure that I was using every lever available to advance our priorities,” he writes.  DeSantis, looking to jumpstart his political career in 2011, eviscerated then-President Barack Obama for what he described as executive overreach. He accused Obama’s then-health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, of using “her power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn’t like.” He wrote Obama was “resorting to using crude vulgarisms, such as the term ‘teabagger,’ to describe their fellow citizens simply because these citizens dissented from progressive orthodoxy.”  But in “The Courage to Be Free,” labeling corporations as “woke” and punishing those that speak out “is not only prudent but necessary to counteract efforts by large corporations to impose a woke agenda on the rest of us.”  As DeSantis writes: “It is regrettable that our nation has become so politicized, but the fact is that private companies wielding de facto public power is not in the best interests of most Americans.”Continuing to litigate his coronavirus responseDeSantis built his reelection for governor around his response to Covid-19 and his book makes clear he will continue to make that a part of his message as he looks toward a potential campaign for president.   As he often does, DeSantis described Florida as a “citadel of freedom in the United States,” and defended his actions to reopen schools for the 2020-2021 school year.   “When I announced Florida’s back to school policy, perhaps because I did so during the height of the summer COVID-19 wave, there was substantial public opposition to my decision,” DeSantis says. “For all the controversy that swirled around my decision, and all the incoming fire I took by making it, there was never a doubt in my mind that keeping our schools open was right for our state.”  “Keeping Florida free” from Covid-19 restrictions has earned DeSantis criticism from Democrats and health experts – a badge he proudly wears. But DeSantis also puts up his response against the rest of the country, even Trump, who he noted stood behind health officials who pushed states to shut down activity for two weeks to slow the spread.   DeSantis also shared insight into his efforts to open up Florida for sports, including a promise to UFC president Dana White to big foot any local government that prevented him from holding fights in Florida.  “I will overrule any mayor that gives you guys a hard time,” DeSantis told White.  DeSantis called for a “thorough and unbiased investigation of all aspects of the pandemic,” including the origins of the virus.   On Monday, John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said, “There is not a consensus right now, in the US government about exactly how Covid got started. There is just not an intelligence community consensus.”  Kirby added that Biden made trying to find the origins of Covid a “priority.”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.
