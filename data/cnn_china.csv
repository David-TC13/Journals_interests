The Xi'an Bell Tower, pictured in December 2021 as the city conducted a citywide disinfection to prevent the spread of Covid.Li Wenbo/VCG/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      A Chinese city has sparked a backlash on social media after saying it would consider the use of lockdowns in the event of an influenza outbreak.  The city of Xi’an – a tourism hotspot in Shaanxi province that is home to the famous terracotta warriors – revealed an emergency response plan this week that would enable it to shut schools, businesses and “other crowded places” in the event of a severe flu epidemic.  That prompted a mixture of anxiety and anger on China’s social media websites among many users who said the plan sounded uncomfortably similar to some of the strict zero-Covid measures China had implemented throughout the pandemic and which have only recently been abandoned.  “Vaccinate the public rather than using such time to create a sense of panic,” one user wrote on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter.  “How will people not panic given that Xi’an’s proposal to suspend work and business activities were issued without clear instruction on the national level to classify the disease?” asked another.  While cases of Covid in China are falling, there has been a spike in flu cases across the country and some pharmacies are struggling to meet demand for flu remedies.

Rather, it outlines how the city of almost 13 million people would respond to any future outbreak based on four levels of severity.  At the first and highest level, it says, “the city can lock down infected areas, carry out traffic quarantines and suspend production and business activities. Shopping malls, theaters, libraries, museums, tourist attractions and other crowded places will also be closed.”  “At this emergency level, schools and nurseries at all levels would be shut down and be made responsible for tracking students’ and infants’ health conditions.”  The backlash comes as the central government in Beijing has emphasized the need to open the country back up following the removal of all Covid restrictions in January.  Throughout the pandemic, China had enforced some of the world’s most severe Covid restrictions, including lockdowns that stretched into months in some cities. It was also one of the last countries in the world to end measures such as mass testing and strict border quarantine periods, even amid growing evidence of the damage being done to its economy.  Xi’an itself was subject to a draconian lockdown between December 2021 and January 2022, with 13 million residents confined to their homes for weeks on end – and many left short of food and other essential supplies. Access to medical services was also affected. In an incident that shocked and angered the nation, a heavily pregnant woman was turned away from a hospital on New Year’s Day because she didn’t have a valid Covid-19 test, and suffered a miscarriage after she was finally admitted two hours later.

Cang Hai/Costfoto/Future Publishing/Getty ImgesShortly before China removed its pandemic era restrictions the country had been rocked by a series of demonstrations against its zero-Covid policy.  Memories of being confined to their homes and of panic buying that in some areas led to food shortages remain fresh in people’s minds and the idea of a return to Covid-style measures appears to have hit a nerve.  However, some voices called for calm.   Epidemiologist Ben Cowling, from the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, said he saw the rationale of the move.   “I think it’s quite rational to make contingency plans. I wouldn’t expect a lockdown to be needed for flu, but presumably there are different response levels,” he said.  One user on Weibo expressed a similar sentiment: “It is merely the revelation of a proposal, not putting it in place. It is quite normal to take precautions given this wave of flu is coming at us very strong.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, with Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani and national security adviser of Saudi Arabia Musaad bin Mohammed Al Aiban in Beijing on March 10, 2023. China Daily/ReutersLondonCNN      When Saudi Arabia and Iran buried the hatchet in Beijing on Friday, it was a game-changing moment both for a Middle East shaped by their decades-old rivalry, and for China’s growing influence in the oil-rich region.   The announcement was surprising yet expected. The two regional powerhouses have been in talks to re-establish diplomatic relations for nearly two years. At times, negotiators seemed to drag their feet, the deep distrust between the two countries appearing immovable.   Iran’s talks with Saudi Arabia were unfolding at the same time as negotiations between Iran and the United States to revive the 2016 nuclear deal were faltering. The outcomes of both sets of Iran talks seemed interlinked – Riyadh and Washington have long walked in lockstep on foreign policy.  But a shift in regional alliances is afoot. Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the US has become strained in recent years, while China’s standing has risen. Unlike Washington, Beijing has shown an ability to transcend the many rivalries that criss-cross the Middle East. China has forged good diplomatic relations with countries across the region, driven by strengthening economic ties, without the Western lectures on human rights.

Parsi argues that the development should trigger a moment of introspection on Washington’s Middle East policy. “What should worry American decision-makers is if this becomes the new norm: the US becomes so deeply embroiled in the conflicts of our regional partners that our manoeuvrability evaporates and our past role as a peacemaker is completely ceded to China,” he added.   Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman shakes hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the China-Arab summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia December 9, 2022. Saudi Press Agency//Reuters    End of a dark era Friday’s agreement could herald the end of a blood-drenched era in the Middle East. Riyadh and Tehran have been at ideological and military loggerheads since Iran’s Islamic Revolution installed an anti-Western, Shia theocracy in 1979.   Those tensions began to escalate into a region-wide proxy war after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq spiraled into civil conflict, with both Iran and Saudi Arabia vying for influence in the petrol-rich Arab country.   Armed conflict that pitted Saudi-backed militants against Iran-backed armed groups washed over much of the region in the decade and a half that followed.   In Yemen, a Saudi-led coalition military campaign to quash Iranian-backed rebels triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. In Syria, Iran supported President Bashar al-Assad as he brutalized his own people, only to find his forces facing off with rebels backed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. In Lebanon too, Iran and Saudi Arabia have backed different factions, contributing to a two-decade-long political crisis that has exacted a huge economic and security toll on the tiny eastern Mediterranean country.   Diplomatic relations were officially severed in 2016 when Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shia Saudi cleric Nimr al-Nimr, leading rioters in Tehran to torch the Saudi embassy.   But a slew of economic problems triggered by the pandemic and costly wars may have eroded the appetite for conflict, and Saudi and Iranian officials say they are eager to turn the page on that dark chapter.  The détente appears to go far beyond the resumption of diplomatic relations. Saudi and Iranian officials say they will also work to reimplement a decades-old security cooperation pact and revive an even older agreement on technology, and trade.   It’s a rare piece of good news for a region still reeling from their rivalry. How that plays out – and whether it can undo the havoc wreaked by the rivalry – remains to be seen.   But analysts say that China’s growing leverage in the region helped hedge both countries’ bets, changing a now-outdated political calculus that once made Western capitals the most likely venue for watershed regional accords.   “China is now the godfather of this agreement and given China’s strategic importance to Iran, that holds tremendous weight,” Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst familiar with the Saudi leadership’s thinking, told CNN.   “If Iran were to break this agreement, it will be hurting its ties to China that has put its full prestige into the ‘tripartite’ agreement.”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Sign up here.Abu Dhabi, UAECNN      Saudi Arabia and Iran announced on Friday that they had agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of hostility, in a deal between the regional archrivals that could have wide-ranging implications for the Middle East.   Riyadh and Tehran plan to reopen their embassies within two months in an agreement mediated by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran said in a joint statement after talks in Beijing on Friday.    They also plan to reimplement a security pact signed 22 years ago under which both parties agreed to cooperate on terrorism, drug-smuggling and money-laundering, as well as reviving a trade and technology deal from 1998.   Friday’s announcement is also a diplomatic victory for China in a Gulf region that has long been considered part of the US’ domain of influence. It comes as the Biden administration tries to notch its own win in the Middle East by trying to broker a normalization pact between Israel and Saudi Arabia.   Talks had been ongoing since March 6 in Beijing between Iranian national security chief Ali Shamkhani, Saudi national security council adviser Mosaed Bin Mohammad Al-Aiban and China’s top diplomat Wang Yi, according to Iranian state media.   Video of the signing ceremony aired by Iranian media showed officials seated around tables on opposite sides with the Saudi Arabian, Iranian and Chinese flags around them.

In an apparent push back to American influence, Wang said that “the world is not limited to the Ukraine issue” while emphasizing that the fate of the Middle East should be determined by the people of the Middle East.   “The foreign ministers of the two countries will meet each other to implement this decision and make necessary arrangements for the exchange of ambassadors,” the joint statement said. “The two sides agree to respect the sovereignty and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.”     Saudi Arabia and Iran had previously held talks aimed at reconciliation in Oman and Iraq.   Riyadh severed ties with Tehran in 2016 after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in the Iranian capital following the execution of a Shi’ite cleric in Saudi Arabia. Since then, they have fought a proxy war that has embroiled a number of neighboring countries, bringing the region ever closer to war.   In Yemen, the two countries have supported opposite sides of a civil war that has been described by the United Nations as one the world’s worst humanitarian crises. From there, the Houthi rebels have fired missiles at both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, targeting oil infrastructure that is vital to their economies.    Saudi Arabia has however been engaged in direct talks with the Houthis, and an unofficial ceasefire appears to be holding.   In a speech prior to the signing of the agreement with his Iranian counterpart, Saudi Arabia’s Al-Aiban called for non-interference in the sovereignty of states to be a “fundamental pillar for the development of relations.”  “We value what we have reached and we hope that we will continue the constructive dialogue, in accordance with the pillars and foundations included in the agreement,” he said.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian hailed the deal and said Tehran would step up its diplomatic efforts in the region.    “Iran and Saudi Arabia relations returning to normal makes the two countries, the region and the Muslim world stronger,” Amir-Abdollahian tweeted on Friday.   Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated on the global stage. Talks to revive Iran’s 2015 nuclear pact with world powers are frozen and relations with Western states have faced further strains due to the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on protests that started in September.   Iran’s main international ally Russia is preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, while China, its other ally, has lately been courting Tehran’s archrival Saudi Arabia.

In December, Chinese President Xi Jinping was welcomed in Riyadh in an extravagant ceremony as part of a visit that brought together 14 Arab heads of state. That was just months after a relatively low-key meeting with US President Joe Biden, whose relationship with Saudi Arabia has been frosty.“China’s role as a broker is striking, and could foreshadow a bolder diplomatic position,” said Sanam Vakil, a senior research fellow for the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House think-tank in London.    “But we should be cautious in overstating Beijing’s intentions. This is more about China’s interests in the region. China has brought together two key actors – regional and economic actors –  for the purpose of reducing regional tensions and facilitating greater economic engagement with both.”   Xiaofei Xu, Shawn Deng and Abbas Al Lawati contributed to this report.

US Air Force When China shot down five U-2 spy planes at the height of the Cold War    			By Brad Lendon and Wayne Chang, CNN		  Updated  7:55 PM EST, Fri March 10, 2023    Link Copied!   A U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" in a hangar at Osan Air Base, South Korea, on Oct. 22, 2020. US Air ForceSeoul, South KoreaCNN      When a Chinese high-altitude balloon suspected of spying was spotted over the United States recently, the US Air Force responded by sending up a high-flying espionage asset of its own: the U-2 reconnaissance jet.   It was the Cold-War era spy plane that took the high-resolution photographs – not to mention its pilot’s selfie – that reportedly convinced Washington the Chinese balloon was gathering intelligence and not, as Beijing continues to insist, studying the weather.  In doing so, the plane played a key role in an event that sent tensions between the world’s two largest economies soaring, and shone an international spotlight on the methods the two governments use to keep tabs on each other.  Until now, most of the media’s focus has been on the balloon – specifically, how a vessel popularly seen as a relic of a bygone era of espionage could possibly remain relevant in the modern spy’s playbook. Yet to many military historians, it is the involvement of that other symbol of a bygone time, the U-2, that is far more telling.   The U-2 has a long and storied history when it comes to espionage battles between the US and China. In the 1960s and 1970s, at least five of them were shot down while on surveillance missions over China.  Those losses haven’t been as widely reported as might be expected – and for good reason. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which was responsible for all of America’s U-2s at the time the planes were shot down, has never officially explained what they were doing there.   Adding to the mystery was that the planes were being flown not by US pilots nor under a US flag, but by pilots from Taiwan who, in a striking parallel to today’s balloon saga, claimed to be involved in a weather research initiative.  A US Air Force pilot looks down at the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon from the cockpit of his U-2 spy plane on February 3, 2023.US Department of Defense    The Dragon Lady and Chinese nukesThat the CIA would be tight-lipped over what these American-built spy planes were doing is hardly surprising.   But the agency’s continued silence more than 50 years later – it did not respond to a CNN request for comment on this article – speaks volumes about just how sensitive the issue was both at the time and remains today.   The US government has a general rule of 25 years for automatic declassification of sensitive material. However, one of its often-cited reasons for ignoring this rule is in those cases where revealing the information would “cause serious harm to relations between the US and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the US.”  Contemporary accounts of what the planes were doing – by the Taiwan pilots who were shot down, retired US Air Force officers and military historians among them – leave little doubt as to why it would have caused a stir.  The planes – according to accounts by the pilots in a Taiwan-made documentary film and histories published on US government websites – had been transferred to Taiwan as part of a top-secret mission to snoop on Communist China’s growing military capabilities, including its nascent nuclear program, which was receiving help from the Soviet Union.  'Like walking on missiles': US airman recalls the horror of the Vietnam 'Christmas bombings' 50 years onThe newly developed U-2, nicknamed the Dragon Lady, appeared to offer the perfect vessel. The US had already used it to spy on the Soviet’s domestic nuclear program as its high-altitude capabilities – it was designed in the 1950s to reach “a staggering and unprecedented altitude of 70,000 feet,” in the words of its developer Lockheed – put it out of the range of antiaircraft missiles.  Or so the US had thought. In 1960, the Soviets shot down a CIA-operated U-2 and put its pilot Gary Powers on trial. Washington was forced to abandon its cover story (that Powers had been on a weather reconnaissance mission and had drifted into Soviet airspace after blacking out from oxygen depletion), admit the spy plane program, and barter for Powers to be returned in a prisoner swap.  “Since America didn’t want to have its own pilots shot down in a U-2 the way Gary Powers had been over the Soviet Union in 1960, which caused a major diplomatic incident, they turned to Taiwan, and Taiwan was all too willing to allow its pilots to be trained and to do a long series of overflights over mainland China,” Chris Pocock, author of “50 Years of the U-2,” explained in the 2018 documentary film “Lost Black Cats 35th Squadron.”  A mobile chase car pursues a U-2 Dragon Lady as it prepares to land at Beale Air Force Base in California in June 2015.US Air Force    The Black Cats and Detachment HLike the U-2, Taiwan – also known as the Republic of China (ROC) – seemed a perfect choice for the mission. The self-governing island to the east of the Chinese mainland was at odds with the Communist leadership in Beijing – as it remains today – and at that time in history had a mutual defense treaty with Washington.  That treaty has long since lapsed, but Taiwan remains a point of major tensions between China and the United States, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping vowing to bring it under the Communist Party’s control and Washington still obligated to provide it with the means to defend itself.  Today, the US sells F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan as part of that obligation. In the 1960s, Taiwan got the US-made U-2s.  The island’s military set up a squadron that would officially be known as the “Weather Reconnaissance and Research Section.”   But its members – pilots from Taiwan who had been trained in the US to fly U-2s – knew it by a different name: the “Black Cats.”   The author Pocock and Gary Powers Jr., the son of the pilot shot down by the Soviets and the co-founder of the Cold War Museum in Washington, DC, explained the thinking behind the squadron and its mission in the 2018 documentary film.The other CIA unit in Taiwan  Coinciding with the Black Cat Squadron, the Black Bat Squadron was formed under the cooperation of the Central Intelligence Agency and Taiwan’s air force, according to a Taiwan Defense Ministry website.While the Black Cats were in charge of high-altitude reconnaissance missions, the Black Bats conducted low-altitude reconnaissance and electronic intelligence gathering missions over mainland China from May 1956. It also operated in Vietnam in tandem with the US during the Vietnam War.Between 1952 to 1972, the Black Bats lost 15 aircraft and 148 lives, according to the website.“The Black Cats program was implemented because the American government needed to find out information over mainland China – what were their strengths and weaknesses, where were their military installations located, where were their submarine bases, what type of aircraft were they developing,” said Powers Jr.  Lloyd Leavitt, a retired US Air Force lieutenant general, described the mission as “a joint intelligence operation by the United States and the Republic of China.”    “American U-2s were painted with ROC insignia, ROC pilots were under the command of a ROC (Air Force) colonel, overflight missions were planned by Washington, and both countries were recipients of the intelligence gathered over the mainland,” Leavitt wrote in a 2010 personal history of the Cold War published by the Air Force Research Institute in Alabama.  One of the first men to fly the U-2 for Taiwan was Mike Hua, who was there when the first of the planes arrived at Taoyuan Air Base in Taiwan in early 1961.   “The cover story was that the ROC (air force) had purchased the aircraft, that bore the (Taiwanese) national insignia. … To avoid being confused with other air force organizations stationed in Taoyuan, the section became the 35th Squadron with the Black Cat as its insignia,” Hua wrote in a 2002 history of the unit for the magazine Air Force Historical Foundation.  At the Taiwan airbase, Americans worked with the Taiwan pilots, helping to maintain the aircraft and process the information. They were know as Detachment H, according to Hua.  “All US personnel were ostensibly employees of the Lockheed Aircraft Company,” Hua wrote.Code name: RazorThe ROC air force and US representatives inked an agreement on the operation, giving it the code name “Razor,” Hua wrote.  He described the intelligence gained by the flights as “tremendous” and said it was shared between Taipei and Washington.  “The missions covered the vast interior of the Chinese mainland, where almost no aerial photographs had ever been taken,” he wrote. “Each mission brought back an aerial photographic map of roughly 100 miles wide by 2,000 miles long, which revealed not only the precise location of a target, but also the activities on the ground.”  Other sensors on the spy planes gathered information on Chinese radar capabilities and more, he said.  Between January 1962 and May 1974, according to a history on Taiwan’s Defense Ministry’s website, the Black Cats flew 220 reconnaissance missions covering “more than 10 million square kilometers over 30 provinces in the Chinese mainland.”   When asked for further comment on the Black Cats, the ministry referred CNN to the published materials.  “The idea was that black cats go out at night, and the U-2 would usually launch in the darkness. Their cameras were the eyes, and it was very stealthy, quiet, and hard to get. And so combining the two stories, they became known as the Black Cats,” the author Pocock said in the documentary.  The squadron even had its own patch, reputedly drawn by one of its members, Lt. Col. Chen Huai-sheng, and inspired by a local establishment frequented by the pilots.  But the Black Cats, like Powers Sr. two years before, were about to find out their U-2s were not impervious to antiaircraft fire.   On September 9, 1962, Chen became the first U-2 pilot to be shot down by a People’s Liberation Army antiaircraft missile. His plane went down while on a mission over Nanchang, China.

It was a cat-and-mouse game, literally a black cat and mouse game between the routines from the flights from Taiwan and those air defense troops of the (Chinese) mainland, working out where the next flight would go.”  In July 1964, Lt. Col. Lee Nan-ping’s U-2 was shot down by a PLA SA-2 missile over Chenghai, China. According to the Taiwan Defense Ministry he was flying out of a US naval air station in the Philippines and trying to gain information on China’s supply routes to North Vietnam.  In September 1967, a PLA missile hit the U-2 being flown by Capt. Hwang Rung-pei over Jiaxin, China, and in May 1969, Maj. Chang Hsieh suffered a “flight control failure” over the Yellow Sea while reconnoitering the coast of Hebei province, China. No trace of his U-2 was ever found, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry.  A U-2 Dragon Lady, from Beale Air Force Base, lands at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, in 2017. US Air Force    Captured by the CommunistsTwo other Taiwanese U-2 pilots were shot down but survived, only to spend years in Communist captivity.  Maj. Robin Yeh was shot down in November 1963 over Jiujiang, Jiangxi province.   “The plane lost control when the explosion of the missile took out part of the left wing. The plane spiraled down. Lots of shrapnel flew into the plane and hit both of my legs,” Yeh, who died in 2016, recalled in “The Brave in the Upper Air: An Oral History of The Black Cat Squadron” published by Taiwan’s Defense Ministry.  He said that following his capture Chinese doctors removed 59 pieces of shrapnel from his legs, but couldn’t take it all out.  “It didn’t really affect my daily life, but during winter my legs would hurt, which affected my mobility. I guess this would be my lifelong memory,” Yeh said.  Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, pictured in 2022.Anupam/Adobe StockUncontacted tribes and an Indian military base. Did a 'spy' balloon snoop on the Andaman and Nicobar islands?Maj. Jack Chang’s U-2 was hit by a missile over Inner Mongolia in 1965. He, too, suffered dozens of shrapnel injuries and bailed out, landing on a snowy landscape.  “It was dark at the time, preventing me from seeking help anyway, so I had to wrap myself up tightly with the parachute to keep myself warm … After ten hours when dawn broke, I saw a village of yurts afar, so I dragged myself and sought help there. I collapsed as soon as I reached a bed,” he recalled in the oral history.  Neither Yeh nor Chang, who were assumed killed in action, would see Taiwan again for decades. The pilots were eventually released in 1982 into Hong Kong, which at the time was still a British colony.  However, the world into which they emerged had changed greatly in the intervening years. The US no longer had a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and had formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.  Though the Cold War US-Taiwan alliance was no longer, the CIA brought the two pilots to the US to live until they were finally allowed to return to Taiwan in 1990.  Members of the 5th Reconnaissance Squadron ""Black Cats"" work on a U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" at Osan Air Base on Oct. 22, 2020.US Air Force    No regretsIndeed, by the time of their release CIA control of the U-2 program had long since ceased. It had turned the planes over to the US Air Force in 1974, according to a US Air Force history.Two years later, the Air Force’s 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron and its U-2s moved into Osan Air Base in South Korea. Commander Lt. Col. David Young gave the location the “Black Cat” moniker.  Today, the unit is known as the 5th Reconnaissance Squadron.  But US U-2s continue to be involved in what might be characterized as “cat-and-mouse” activities and their activities continue to make waves occasionally in China. In 2020, Beijing accused the US of sending a U-2 into a no-fly zone to “trespass” on live-fire exercises being conducted by China below.  The US Pacific Air Forces confirmed to CNN at the time that the flight had taken place, but said it did not violate any rules.  Meanwhile, for those involved in the original Black Cats, there are few regrets – even for those who were captured.  Yeh told the documentary makers he had fond memories of life at 70,000 feet.  “We were literally up in the air. The view we had was also different; we had the bird’s eye view. Everything we saw was vast,” he said.  Chang too felt no bitterness.  “I love flying,” he said. “I didn’t die, so I have no regrets.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  USCrime + Justice    Energy + Environment    Extreme Weather    Space + ScienceWorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomPoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessTech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosMarketsPre-markets    After-Hours    Market Movers    Fear & Greed    World Markets    Investing    Markets Now    Before the Bell    NightcapOpinionPolitical Op-Eds    Social CommentaryHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsPro Football    College Football    Basketball    Baseball    Soccer    Olympics    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRAudio  CNN UnderscoredElectronics    Fashion    Beauty    Health & Fitness    Home    Reviews    Deals    Money    Gifts    Travel    Outdoors    Pets    CNN StoreCoupons  WeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

China's newly-appointed Premier Li Qiang takes an oath during the National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 11, 2023.Greg Baker/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      China’s rubber-stamp legislature has appointed Li Qiang, a long-time aide of leader Xi Jinping, as premier, the man tasked with reviving the world’s second-largest economy after three years of zero-Covid restrictions.  The National People’s Congress endorsed Li in a largely ceremonial vote at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Saturday morning. Li got 2,936 votes, with three votes cast against him and eight abstained.  Li, 63, is one of the most trusted protégés of Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades. He will replace outgoing Premier Li Keqiang, who had been Xi’s second in command since 2013.  Traditionally, the premiership is an influential role in charge of the economy, although over the past decade, its power has been eroded by Xi, who has taken almost all decision-making into his own hands.  Even so, much of the new premier’s efforts are likely to be concentrated on trying to turn around the fortunes of the Chinese economy, which recently set a GDP growth target for this year of about 5% – the lowest in decades.   Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers his state of the nation address during the opening session of China's National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Sunday, March 5, 2023. Ng Han Guan/APChina sets lowest GDP growth target in decades as Beijing tightens its beltThat will be no easy task: China is in the midst of a historic downturn for the all-important housing market, consumer spending is sluggish, and unemployment remains high among the youth. And local governments are saddled by debt.  Business confidence has plummeted following an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on the private sector and increased uncertainties about China’s future policy. Relations between the United States and China are at their lowest point in decades, leading to escalating tensions in technology and investment. Foreign investment in China has slumped.  Xi identified Li Qiang, a former Communist Party boss of Shanghai who presided over the city’s chaotic two-month lockdown, as the man to take on these challenges during a leadership reshuffle in October.  Born in the eastern province of Zhejiang, Li started his career as a worker at an irrigation pumping station. He received his undergraduate education in agricultural mechanization at a college in the city of Ningbo and then worked his way up through the provincial bureaucracy.  From left, Zhu Hexin, He Lifeng, Ding Xuexiang and Li Qiang.AP licensedMeet the 4 men tapped to run China's economy His career took off after he served as Xi’s de facto chief of staff when Xi was the party chief of Zhejiang province between 2002 and 2007.  Li is the first premier since the Mao era not to have previously worked at the State Council, China’s cabinet, as vice premier, analysts say.  It was Li’s personal ties with Xi that appear to have clinched his promotion over more qualified candidates, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said when Li was promoted last year.  But some analysts said his tenure in Shanghai, particularly before last year’s Covid lockdown, pointed to a pragmatic, pro-business style.  During Li’s time there, Tesla built its first gigafactory outside the United States in the city. Tesla has sole ownership of that factory, the first foreign automaker in China to wholly own its plant.  “China’s business environment should turn more friendly, at least, in the coming two years” under Li, who is likely to support private companies and foreign investors, Citi analysts said in a research report.  In 2019, Li also oversaw the launch of China’s Nasdaq-style stock market on the Shanghai stock exchange.

The dispute is technical but highly contentious. It comes at a moment – a year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – when unity between the US and its European allies is already being tested.  The quarrel centers on a provision of Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act that offered tax credits for electric vehicles. The law specifies in order to qualify for the credit, the vehicles must source a percentage of the material for their batteries from North America or countries with a free trade agreement with the US – which the EU does not.  The law has infuriated some of the United States’ top allies, like the EU, who say their countries are being penalized. The timing is inopportune, as Biden works to maintain transatlantic unity as the war in Ukraine enters a second year.  In their talks in the Oval Office on Friday, Biden and von der Leyen discussed the matter and announced a new set of negotiations that, if successful, would allow European companies to benefit from the Biden law and reduce both US and EU dependence on China.  “We have agreed that we will start work now with the clear goal: The goal is to have an agreement on critical raw materials that have been sourced or processed in the European Union, that these strategic supply chains are able to access the American market as if they had been sourced in the United States,” von der Leyen said outside the White House after the meeting concluded.  The two leaders also discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, including plans to deepen cooperation on enforcing sanctions against Russia and third-party countries who are supporting Moscow’s invasion. That could soon include China, which US officials have warned is considering providing lethal aid to Russia.  Yet it is the transatlantic economic issues that formed the center of the talks, particularly the disagreement over Biden’s climate law, which European officials have slammed as protectionist.   The agreement the two leaders announced centered on the critical minerals that are necessary for electric vehicle batteries, perhaps unlocking for Europe some of the Inflation Reduction Act’s benefits.  “I look forward to talking about all that with you,” Biden said at the meeting got underway in the Oval Office.   “We’re driving new investments to create clean energy industries and jobs and make sure we have supply chains available to both our continents,” Biden said as the meeting got underway in the Oval Office. “That idea underpins our Inflation Reduction Act, and it lies at the heart of the your green deal industrial plan for the EU, and so I hope we can talk about that today.”  If not resolved, the issue could potentially spiral into competing subsidies that neither side wants, and add to strains caused by the war in Ukraine.  “What we want to do is maximize the amount of deployment, maximize the speed of that deployment, and do so in a way that builds each of our respective industrial bases. That isn’t going to happen if our incentives and their incentives are misaligned, and compete with one another in a zero sum way,” a senior US administration official said ahead of the meeting.  After Biden signed the law last year, European allies reacted harshly, setting off a scramble within the administration to resolve the issues while not angering members of Congress who supported the Made-in-America aspects of the law.  Among the top proponents of the measure: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat whose support is critical for the White House on a number of issues.  Biden’s meeting Friday won’t completely resolve the matter, according to officials, but instead launch a process of arriving at a type of trade agreement that would meet the law’s requirements and allow European companies to help supply battery materials – like lithium and nickel – for electric vehicles.  US officials have been in similar discussions with counterparts from the United Kingdom and Japan to assuage those nations’ similar concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act.  It’s unclear how long the process might take.  “The goal here is to ensure that as we make our investments, as Europe make its investments, that our approaches are communicated, that we’re communicating with one another on our approaches so that we maximize the deployment of clean energy technology over time, and not that those incentives compete with one another,” the official said.

Chinese troops attend the opening ceremony of the 'Peace Mission 2021' joint counter-terrorism military exercise held in Russia in September 2021.Li Chun/China News Service/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      Chinese state-owned defense firms have maintained trade relationships with sanctioned Russian defense companies during the past year, even as many of the world’s leading economies cut ties with Moscow and the companies driving its continued assault on Ukraine.     Customs records reviewed by CNN show key companies within both countries’ vast military-industrial complexes have continued their years-long relationships, despite the horror Moscow has unleashed in Europe.   putin firma ley suspension new start lkl jose levy_00015214.pngvideo    Putin says Russia's economy is strong. Biden disagrees. Here's the realityRecords show that throughout 2022, through at least mid-November, Beijing-based defense contractor Poly Technologies sent at least a dozen shipments – including helicopter parts and air-to-ground radio equipment – to a state-backed Russian firm sanctioned by the US for its connection to leader Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.   Poly Technology’s long-term trade partner – Ulan Ude Aviation Plant, a purveyor of military-grade helicopters – also continued to send parts and several helicopters to the Beijing-based company last year, trade data show.   Most of the helicopter parts included in the shipments to Russia were labeled for use in the multipurpose Mi-171E helicopter, designed for transport and search and rescue. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China began importing this model of chopper from Russia more than 10 years ago.    Three shipments from Poly Technologies were labeled as including products for the operation or service of the Russian-made Mi-171SH, a military transport helicopter that can be equipped with weapons and has been used in Moscow’s operations in Ukraine.    There is no evidence that any of the goods exchanged are directly feeding Russia’s war.  CNNvideo    National security adviser warns China about sending weapons to RussiaThe customs records came from two data sets. The first was provided by trade data firm Import Genius, whose information is collated by secondary sources from official Russian customs and shipment records.    Washington-based think tank C4ADS, which collates official customs records aggregated from multiple third-party providers, provided the second set.    CNN has not independently verified the data, which may provide a partial but not complete picture of the trade.   Military and security experts say the parts sent from the Chinese firm to Russia are fairly basic equipment for Russian-designed aircraft that could be part of existing contracts and standard business relationships between the companies.    But last year’s trade underscores enduring ties between key players in the state-backed defense sectors on both sides – relationships that had strengthened over the past decade as Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping developed their strategic alignment.    Experts say such well-established networks could be leveraged if Beijing were to provide direct, lethal aid for the Kremlin’s war effort.    Western leaders in recent weeks have warned China is considering that step. Beijing has denied this, derided the warning as a “smear,” and repeatedly defended its “normal” trade with Russia and rejected what it calls “unilateral” sanctions against Moscow.

Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    Evolving partnership Beijing and Moscow’s military ties have evolved dramatically since the height of the Cold War – a period marked by mutual hostility and ideological divergence.    While some frictions remain, the two authoritarian neighbors have grown close, especially under Putin and Xi, who together declared a “no limits” partnership just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.   That includes a growing security relationship.   Following the fall of the Soviet Union, a robust, but decidedly one-way weapons trade flourished in which Russia marketed its superior weaponry to China.   More recently, the rapid modernization of China’s military has begun to shift that dynamic.   In 2021, Putin boasted that the two countries were “developing together certain high-tech types of weapons,” according to Russian state media, and lauded their joint military exercises – which have also expanded in scope and geographic range.

Those are being integrated into an “an increasingly sophisticated supply chain,” according to Alex Gabuev, a senior fellow at the international think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.     Then came the Ukraine war.    So far, China has stepped carefully around sweeping Western penalties targeting those supporting Russia – although 10 Chinese companies have been hit by US restrictions related to the war.    But a major question for Western officials is whether existing defense relationships could be used by China to supply lethal aid for the Kremlin’s war effort, which is widely believed to be running low on ammunition and arms.   Last month CNN reported that US intelligence officials believe the Chinese government is considering sending drones and ammunition to Russia.   On March 7, China’s new foreign minister Qin Gang said that China “has not provided weapons to either side” of Russia’s war, and denounced US concerns in the matter as hypocritical.    Observers of Chinese foreign affairs say its leaders are well aware of the reputational and economic damage if it is perceived to be backing Moscow militarily – and many are skeptical Beijing would take such a step to aid a nuclear-armed Russia at this time.   “Russia is losing this war in general terms … but it’s not a loss that would lead to Putin’s demise and democratization of Russia, so I don’t see reasons for China now to do more than they are doing,” said Gabuev.

China is also not alone in continuing procurement from a Russia at war.   When asked by CNN about the shipments from China to sanctioned Russian firms, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was “unaware of the situation,” and that China “stand(s) firmly on the side of dialogue and peace.”    The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.    But on February 27 its spokesman said Russia saw “no need to comment further” on claims that Russia asked China for military equipment which he said had already been refuted by Beijing.

China Poly Group did not respond to a request for comment.  The company’s trade partner Ulan Ude Aviation Plant, a subsidiary of top state-owned manufacturer Russian Helicopters, which makes the widely used Mi-8/17 series helicopters long integral to Russian military transport, also did not respond to a request for comment.   Two other key companies appear in the customs data – China’s AVIC International Holding, controlled by state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, and Russia’s United Engine Corporation (UEC), which is part of state-owned defense giant Rostec.   Their trade involved Russian-designed jet engine parts, many of which were labeled for an engine used in Chinese fighter jets.    Shipments from AVIC International to UEC made through July last year were listed as contractual obligations under warranty, and export records show UEC shipping parts for the same engine model to China including as recently as December, according to data from Import Genius.   AVIC International and UEC did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously referenced shipments made from Poly Technologies and AVIC International Holding to Russian partners.

But China may not be too concerned about the transactions shown in the trade data reviewed by CNN, according to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.    “This type of export has to be approved by the government. But given the nature of these parts and the fact that (Poly Technologies) has been under US sanction since 2013, the government may not see the need not to approve,” she said.

Sun said it was no surprise Russia would continue fulfilling contracts for Chinese-purchased equipment, but warned goods going the opposite direction could be “reimported by Russia to supply their war attrition.”   It’s also unlikely that the full picture will ever be revealed.   “Neither China nor Russia wants Western intelligence to be aware of the depth and breadth of their strategic alignment,” said Alexander Korolev, a senior lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales in Australia.   If China were to supply lethal aid, Korolev added, “everything would be done to cover this up.”   “And one way to cover it up is to make it look as if it’s just a part of regular, long-term military technical cooperation – rather than a response to the war.”     CNN’s Beijing bureau and Josh Pennington contributed reporting.

SVB Financial Group    (SIVB), which is partnered with nearly half of all venture-backed tech and health care companies in the United States, was forced to raise capital after it sold part of its portfolio of US Treasuries at a loss to cover a rapid decline in customer deposits.   The Nasdaq exchange suspended trading in SVB shares at 8.35 a.m. ET Friday after they fell 49% in premarket trading. Stocks in the company cratered 60% on Thursday.  “Lots of banks hold large portfolios of bonds and rising interest rates make these less valuable — the SVB situation is a reminder that many institutions are sitting on large unrealized losses on their fixed-income holdings,” commented Russ Mould, investment director at UK broker AJ Bell.  Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.9% in early trading, while London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100    (UKX) index slid 1.4%.   The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big European banks, including those in the United Kingdom, sank by more than 4% Friday morning before recovering slightly.  Shares in banking giant HSBC    (HSBC) tumbled 4.5% Friday. The shares of Barclays    (BCS) were down 3.6%, Deutsche Bank    (DB) 6.8% and Italy’s Unicredit     (UNCFF)4%.   In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng     (HSNGY)led losses in the region, sinking 3%, while China’s Shanghai and Korea’s Kospi fell 1.4% and 1% respectively.  Asian markets have also been pressured this week because China has failed to announce any major economic stimulus during its National People’s Congress.   Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei ended Friday down 1.7% as the country’s central bank decided to keep its ultra-low interest rates unchanged.    US stocks dipped in pre-market trading, before recovering to post modest gains by 9.07 a.m. ET.Fall from graceThe losses come after US bank stocks logged the largest falls in nearly three years on Thursday. The KBW Bank Index, which tracks 24 leading US banks, fell 7.7%, its biggest drop in almost three years.  The Dow closed lower by 543 points, or 1.7%, Thursday. The S&P 500 fell by 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.1%.  The selloff is a sharp turnaround for the global banking sector, which, until Thursday, had enjoyed surging stock valuations since last fall.   On one hand, high interest rates have been a boon for banks, helping them make heftier returns on loans to households and businesses, and as savers deposit more of their money into savings accounts.  But, on the other, some large banks that had scooped up expensive Treasuries and other bonds when interest rates were very low, are sitting on losses as borrowing costs have risen and bond prices have gone down.   Banks heavily exposed to the tech sector, like SVB, are particularly at risk as cash-hungry startups withdraw their deposits.

US President Joe Biden (L) and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (R) pictured in Jeddah on July 16, 2022.Mandel Ngan/Pool/AFP/Getty Images/FILEWashingtonCNN      Saudi Arabia is looking to the United States for security guarantees and help with its civilian nuclear program as a condition for normalizing relations with Israel, according to people familiar with the matter, setting up a critical decision that could reshape the political situation in the Middle East.   The discussions are ongoing, and it wasn’t clear precisely what the terms of any agreement might look like, if it ever comes to pass.   Ramping up security guarantees for Saudi Arabia would likely face stiff resistance from some members of Congress, who have called on the Biden administration to downgrade Washington’s relationship with Riyadh.   Still, President Joe Biden has placed importance on normalizing ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, as has Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who believe better relations between the two nations could help increase security in the Middle East. Israel and Saudi Arabia have been cultivating unofficial ties for several years, though remain without official diplomatic relations.  “The better the relations between Israel and their Arab neighbors, the better for everybody,” Biden said Friday at the end of a speech about the economy.   Israel has already secured diplomatic agreements with other Arab nations, including Morocco, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The Abraham Accords were a signature achievement of the Trump administration and Biden has vowed to build upon them, particularly as Iran’s nuclear program advances.   A spokesman for the US National Security Council declined to confirm Saudi Arabia was seeking security guarantees from the US, which were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.Instead, John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the NSC, pointed to accomplishments Biden secured when he visited Israel and Saudi Arabia over the summer.  “The President’s trip to the region accomplished a lot,” said Kirby, citing an agreement on contested Red Sea islands and a recent announcement by Oman it would allow Israeli overflights.  “We’re going to keep that diplomacy going,” he said.   The State Department did not reply to a request for comment. The Israeli Embassy in Washington had no comment.

Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty ImagesArchrivals Iran and Saudia Arabia agree to end years of hostilities in deal mediated by China  The consequences of a US-brokered agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia could be widespread. It would throw into doubt the future of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has seen renewed violence in recent weeks under Israel’s right-wing government.   US officials also believe normalizing relations would provide heft to a regional counterweight against Iran, which has advanced its nuclear enrichment over the last year.  Last year, Biden promised Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences” after the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil cartel unexpectedly announced it would cut production, though the Biden administration has no plans to take proactive steps to punish – let alone significantly reorient its posture toward – the oil-rich Middle East kingdom.  On Friday, Saudi Arabia and Iran announced that they had agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of hostility, in a deal between regional archrivals that could have wide-ranging implications for the Middle East.  Riyadh and Tehran plan to reopen their embassies in an agreement mediated by China, a joint statement by Saudi Arabia and Iran said on Friday.  Kirby said Saudi officials had kept the White House informed on the talks as they progressed. But he downplayed Beijing’s role in brokering the agreement, saying the roadmap to reestablishing ties also included talks in Iraq and Oman.

Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, introduced legislation that would block tax credits for electric vehicle batteries produced using Chinese technology, saying it would “significantly restrict the eligibility of IRA tax credits and prevent Chinese companies from benefiting.”  Ford said in response to Rubio that “making those batteries here at home is much better than continuing to rely exclusively on foreign imports, like other auto companies do. A wholly owned Ford subsidiary alone will build, own and operate this plant. No other entity will get US tax dollars for this project.”  Last month, Rubio asked the Biden administration to review Ford’s deal to use technology from CATL.  Rubio called for an immediate Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review of the licensing agreement between Ford and CATL.  Rubio said the deal “will only deepen US reliance on the Chinese Communist Party for battery tech, and is likely designed to make the factory eligible for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits.”  CFIUS is a US Treasury-led interagency panel that reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security.  Treasury declined to comment, but Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said last month the Ford deal will “bringing advanced manufacturing capabilities from overseas to the United States is key to our competitiveness, will stimulate our economy, and create good-paying American jobs.”  Ford has said the plant would create 2,500 jobs and begin producing lower cost and faster recharging lithium-iron-phosphate batteries in 2026.  The $430 billion IRA imposes restrictions on battery sourcing and is designed to wean the United States off the Chinese supply chain for electric vehicles (EVs). The IRA will eventually bar credits if any EV battery components were manufactured by a “foreign entity of concern,” in a provision aimed at China.

Germany shootingSeven people were killed during a mass shooting on Thursday at a Jehovah’s Witnesses Kingdom Hall in the German city of Hamburg in what the country’s leader denounced as a “brutal act of violence.” The alleged perpetrator also died in the incident, Hamburg police said. There is “no confirmed information on the motive for the crime,” police said in a statement. As the investigation remains ongoing, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has led politicians in denouncing the murder spree in the northern German city. “Several members of a Jehovah community fell victim to a brutal act of violence last night. My thoughts are with them and their loved ones,” he wrote on Twitter today.2. Mexico kidnappingA week after the kidnapping of four Americans in Mexico, investigators are still working to piece together how and why the abduction unfolded. This comes after a cartel apologized for carrying out what one victim’s father has called “a senseless crime” that left two Americans and one Mexican woman dead. The Gulf Cartel, which is believed to be responsible for the kidnapping, also issued an alleged apology letter and handed over five of its members to local authorities. The tight-knit group of friends had traveled from South Carolina to Matamoros so that one of them could undergo a medical procedure – but they were violently intercepted by gunmen who fired into their vehicle, loaded them into the back of a truck and took them away.   Video Ad FeedbackFriend of Americans kidnapped in Mexico recounts the moments before they went missing    06:35   - Source:CNN    3. Biden’s BudgetPresident Joe Biden released his annual budget Thursday, outlining his policy priorities for the year ahead. Biden’s 2024 budget mostly rehashed the president’s earlier proposals to expand the social safety net and to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations. He wants to restore the expanded child tax credit and make permanent enhanced Obamacare subsidies. And he wants to provide universal free preschool, make college more affordable and establish a national paid family and medical leave program. However, the proposed budget has no chance of making it through the Republican-controlled House. It could still frame upcoming political battles on Capitol Hill, where the GOP has yet to unveil its own spending plan.

ChinaChinese President Xi Jinping was reappointed today for another five years in a ceremonial vote in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People – a highly choreographed exercise in political theater meant to demonstrate the legitimacy and unity of the ruling elite. He received a unanimous 2,952 votes followed by a standing ovation. The reappointment of Xi, China’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, was largely seen as a formality after the 69-year-old secured a norm-shattering third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party last fall. In 2018, China’s legislature abolished presidential term limits in a ceremonial vote, effectively allowing Xi to rule for life. Nevertheless, his reappointment as head of state officially completes his transition into a second decade in power.

Gun lawsA federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a Florida law that raised the minimum age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21. The law was initially passed after 17 people were killed in a shooting by a 19-year-old at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. The 3-0 ruling from the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals comes as age-based restrictions are shaping up to become a flashpoint in the legal battles over gun access since the Supreme Court last year laid out a new test for determining a gun restriction’s constitutionality. But the ruling may also be short-lived after Republican lawmakers in Florida this week introduced a bill that would lower the minimum age required to buy a firearm in the state from 21 back to 18.BREAKFAST BROWSEJimmy Fallon pranks judges on ‘The Voice’The comedian shocked the judges with an unexpected performance of Michael McDonald’s “I Keep Forgettin’.” Watch the video here.

London fears for its future as companies defect to Wall Street    			By Hanna Ziady, CNN		  Updated  7:20 AM EST, Fri March 10, 2023    Link Copied!   A FTSE share index board in the atrium of the London Stock Exchange Group's offices in London, UK, on Friday, August 12, 2022.Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesLondonCNN      London is used to punching well above its weight in global financial markets.   For years, the London Stock Exchange attracted an outsized share of investor capital relative to the size of the UK economy, reflecting the international nature of its listed companies.  In 2000, UK-listed equities made up 11% of the MSCI World Index — which tracks more than 1,500 companies that account for the vast majority of the global stock market by value — according to Citigroup. Fast-forward 23 years and the UK market now represents just 4%, the bank’s chief global equity strategist wrote in the Financial Times.  Investors have been drawn to faster-growing markets in other parts of the world, such as China and India, and to big tech IPOs on Wall Street. Meanwhile, UK pensions funds have slashed their exposure to local stocks in the search of more certain returns on government bonds.  Then came Brexit and years of political turmoil that undermined London’s status as the king of European finance, and battered Britain’s standing in the eyes of investors.  The combined effect has weighed heavily on the FTSE 100    (UKX), which, despite a recent hot streak, has trailed the gains in benchmark exchanges in the European Union and the United States since the global financial crisis.    A general view of the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England in London, UK, on February 2, 2023. Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThese stocks have been shunned for years. Now investors love themFears for London’s future resurfaced over the past week after chipmaker ARM, the crown jewel of the UK tech sector, said it would hold its IPO on Wall Street, and CRH    (CRH), the world’s largest building materials supplier, said it would moving its primary listing to the United States. Shell, London’s largest listed company, has also reportedly considered relocating. The health of London’s markets is vital to the UK economy, hence the growing sense of alarm.  Taken together, the company moves feel like “a vote of no confidence in the investment environment here in the UK,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at stockbroker CMC Markets UK.   London is still a major international financial center. Some $3.8 trillion of daily foreign exchange trades are transacted there — more than in New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo combined. And 70% of global secondary bond market trading happens in the city, according to the London Stock Exchange.   Outside of the United States and China, London also raised the most money, through IPOs and follow-on deals, in 2021. And Britain remained the world’s leading exporter of financial services that year.  Still, there is plenty of evidence that London can’t be complacent about its future. France is now home to Europe’s largest stock market by value — its CAC All-Share Index is worth €3.1 trillion ($3.3 trillion), compared with London’s FTSE All-Share index at £2.4 trillion ($2.9 trillion).  ARM’s headquarters and operations will remain in Britain and the company, owned by Japan’s Softbank, said it intended to consider a subsequent UK listing “in due course.”   Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right, shake hands after a press conference at Windsor Guildhall, Windsor, England, Monday Feb. 27, 2023. The U.K. and the European Union ended years of wrangling and acrimony on Monday, sealing a deal to resolve their thorny post-Brexit trade dispute over Northern Ireland. Dan Kitwood/Pool/APBrexit slammed the UK economy. The new Northern Ireland deal gives it hopeBut its decision to list in New York is clearly part of a trend. Ferguson    (FERGY), a UK-based plumbing equipment supplier, moved its primary listing from London to New York last year. Software group WANdisco and online sports betting company Flutter    (PDYPF), which owns FanDuel, are also exploring US listings, in addition to their UK listings. Flutter    (PDYPF) said it believed a US listing would provide “access to much deeper capital markets, and to new US domestic investors.”  The value gap between the two markets is stark. The MSCI United Kingdom Index, which tracks 80 of the biggest UK-listed companies, now trades at a nearly 40% discount to the 625-strong US MSCI Index, according to researchers at Citi.   The steady erosion of London’s position as a financial center has prompted the UK government and regulators to embark on a program of reforms designed to reboot UK finance.   Dubbed the “Edinburgh Reforms,” they amount to the most significant overhaul of Britain’s financial services policy in two decades and span banking, asset management, insurance and capital markets.   The ARM decision “demonstrates the need for the UK to make rapid progress in its regulatory and market reform agenda,” London Stock Exchange CEO Julia Hoggett said in a statement.   “We are working with regulators, government and wider market participants to ensure UK capital markets provide the best possible funding environment for UK and global companies.”Fighting for its futureLondon’s markets matter a great deal to the wider UK economy.   They are integral to Britain’s sprawling financial services sector, which contributes more than 8% to UK GDP and is the source of roughly 10% of tax revenue, according to PwC.   More than 1 million people work in the industry, with another 1.2 million people employed in related professional services, such as law, auditing and public relations.  Beyond the jobs they create and the tax they generate, financial markets also channel capital into companies to fund future growth.   The loss of ARM — which was a constituent of the FTSE 100 before it was bought by Softbank in 2016 — suggests that without a more vibrant stock market, Britain risks losing the best of its homegrown companies to the United States. The bigger worry is that where listings go, jobs and investment inevitably follow.  In other words, to safeguard its future, London needs to reinvigorate its stock markets.  The city needs to be seen as the place to be for businesses wanting to grow and raise capital, said Alasdair Haynes, the CEO of Aquis Exchange, an upstart rival to the London Stock Exchange and the CBOE.  “We’re brilliant at start-up capital… When it comes to scale-up capital, we are absolutely rubbish,” Haynes told CNN.  The key is to change regulation to make it easier for smaller companies to list and for the public to invest in them ahead of an IPO. “It doesn’t mean lowering standards. It means rules should be proportionate and appropriate for the size of a business,” Haynes said.  London has plenty of potential. It is home to 100 tech “unicorns” — companies valued at more than $1 billion, says the City of London Corporation. That’s more than in the rest of Europe combined. It is also the third biggest fintech hub in the world.   Those “unicorns” should be listing in London “at an earlier stage,” Haynes argues, “rather than growing through private equity and being sold off to Nasdaq.”  Hoggett of the London Stock Exchange puts it this way: “London needs to be young, scrappy and hungry.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Pickleball is America’s fastest-growing sport.

Micronesia's President David Panuelo at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, December 13, 2019.Noel Celis/Pool/Reuters/FILEHong KongCNN      The outgoing president of Micronesia has accused China of engaging in “political warfare” in the Pacific, in an explosive letter advocating for the the dissolution of diplomatic ties with Beijing.  In the 13-page letter, which CNN has obtained, David Panuelo alleges China is preparing to invade the self-ruled island of Taiwan, and has engaged in bribery, political interference and even “direct threats” to ensure the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) remains neutral in the event of war.  China dismissed the letter’s contents as “smears and accusations.”  “I would like to emphasize that China has always upheld the equality of all countries – no matter their size – and has always respected how Micronesia chooses its own development, based on its own circumstances,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Friday in a regular press briefing.   Panuelo, who has previously been critical of Beijing’s actions in the Pacific region, revealed he had considered switching diplomatic recognition to Taipei.  “China is seeking to ensure that, in the event of a war in our Blue Pacific continent between themselves and Taiwan, that the FSM is, at best, aligned with the PRC (China) instead of the United States, and, at worst, that the FSM chooses to ‘abstain’ altogether,” he wrote.  The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan as its own territory – despite having never governed it – and has refused to rule out the use of force to “reunify” it with mainland China.  Panuelo also accused China of “political warfare” in his country, which he claimed included overt activities – such as political alliances, economic measures and public propaganda – and clandestine acts such as “bribery, psychological warfare, and blackmail”.  “One of the reasons that China’s political warfare is successful in so many arenas is that we are bribed to be complicit, and bribed to be silent. That’s a heavy word, but it is an accurate description regardless,” he wrote in the letter.  CNN has reached out to Panuelo an Taiwan’s foreign ministry for comment.

Putin's war has not changed that, data showPanuelo, whose term in office is set to expire in two months after losing his seat in the recent general election, has been president of Micronesia since 2019.   He has previously spoken out on China’s growing influence in the South Pacific, including warning against Beijing’s proposal of a sweeping regional security deal with 10 Pacific Island nations.  Last May, in a separate letter to 22 Pacific leaders seen by CNN, Panuelo said the draft proposal was intended to shift Pacific Island nations with diplomatic ties to China “very close into Beijing’s orbit.”  He argued that in addition to impacting the sovereignty of Pacific Island nations, signing such an agreement could bring about a new “Cold War” amid tensions between China and the West.  China ultimately failed in its bid to strike the security pact with Pacific Island nations.  The release of Panuelo’s latest – and most explosive – letter comes amid heightened concern from regional powers over Beijing’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.  The Pacific Islands’ location, largely to the northeast of Australia, means the island nations have long been viewed by military strategists as a vital connecting thread between the US territory of Guam and US-allied Australia.  Both the US and Australia are wary of a China that has grown increasingly assertive in the South China Sea extending its reach further west into Pacific waters, including toward the FSM, an archipelago of more than 600 islands.   Meanwhile, the island nations themselves – typically more concerned about the ravages of climate change than geopolitics – have been wary of being viewed as pawns in a great power struggle.  China’s interest in building rapport with the Pacific Islands countries is not new.

A focal point of Beijing’s outreach was to win friends away from Taiwan, which is now only formally recognized by four of 14 South Pacific nations, after the Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched allegiance to China in 2019.  In recent years, as Beijing has pursued a more assertive foreign policy and expanded development funding globally in a bid to enhance its international sway, its visibility in the Pacific Islands, too, has grown.   China has backed widely publicized projects in some Pacific Island countries – a national sports stadium to host the Pacific Games in the Solomon Islands, highways in Papua New Guinea, bridges in Fiji – and sent high-level envoys to the region, including two visits from Chinese leader Xi Jinping, once in 2014 and again in 2018.   It’s also become a major trading partner for Pacific Island economies.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping takes his oath while securing a historic third term as president, during a ceremonial vote in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Friday.Mark R. Cristino/ReutersHong KongCNN      Xi Jinping’s unprecedented third term as China’s president was officially endorsed by the country’s political elite on Friday, solidifying his control and making him the longest-serving head of state of Communist China since its founding in 1949.  Xi was reappointed Friday as president for another five years by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in a ceremonial vote in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People – a highly choreographed exercise in political theater meant to demonstrate the legitimacy and unity of the ruling elite.  He received a unanimous 2,952 votes followed by a standing ovation.   The reappointment of Xi, China’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, was largely seen as a formality, after the 69-year-old secured a norm-shattering third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party last fall.  In China, the presidency – or “state chairman” in Chinese – is a largely ceremonial title. Real power resides in the positions of head of the party and military, two key roles that Xi also holds and was reappointed to at a key Communist Party congress in October.  Nevertheless, his reappointment as head of state officially completes his transition into a second decade in power.   And it comes amid a broader reshuffle of leadership roles in the central government, or the State Council, and other state organizations that further increases Xi’s already firm grasp on the levers of power.  Li Qiang, one of Xi’s most trusted protégés, is expected to be chosen China’s premier on Saturday.   Traditionally, the premiership is an influential role in charge of the economy, although over the past decade, its power has been severely eroded by Xi, who has taken almost all decision-making into his own hands.   On Friday, the National People’s Congress (NPC) also appointed other key state leaders, including Zhao Leji as the body’s head and Han Zheng as the country’s vice-president.  The newly appointed leaders all took a public oath of allegiance to the Chinese constitution inside the Great Hall of the People.  The NPC also approved a sweeping plan to reform institutions under the State Council, including the formation of a financial regulatory body and national data bureau and a revamp of its science and technology ministry.  The overhaul is seen as a further step by Xi to strengthen Communist Party control over key areas of policymaking.Challenges aheadWhile Xi has secured a firm grip on power, he faces a myriad of challenges both at home and abroad.  The Chinese economy is struggling to recover from three years of harsh zero-Covid restrictions, investor confidence is waning, and a demographic crisis is looming as the country registered its first population decline in six decades.  China is also facing a series of diplomatic headwinds from Washington and other Western capitals, as relations plummeted in recent years over Beijing’s human rights record, military build-up, handling of Covid and growing partnership with Russia.  In unusually direct remarks Monday, Xi accused the US of leading a campaign to suppress China and causing its serious domestic woes.  “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,” Xi told a group of government advisers representing private businesses on the sidelines of the NPC meeting.  On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Xi on his extended term, according to Russian state media.   “I am confident that working together, we will ensure the further growth of fruitful Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields,” Putin said.  Putin also noted that Russia highly appreciated Xi’s personal contribution “to strengthening relations of comprehensive cooperation and strategic interaction” between Moscow and Beijing, TASS said.Xi has now entered new historical territory. No Chinese leader had held the title of head of state for more than 10 years, including Communist China’s founding father, Chairman Mao Zedong.   Liu Shaoqi, who took over as state chairman from Mao in 1959, was sacked in 1968 and persecuted to death a year later during Mao’s tumultuous Cultural Revolution.  After Mao’s death, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping introduced presidential term limits in China’s constitution in 1982 to avoid the kind of chaos and catastrophe seen under Mao’s life-long rule.   Deng also led institutional reforms to bring a greater separation of positions and functions between the party and the state.  However, those efforts have been severely undermined by Xi, who greatly expanded the party’s hold on power – and his own grip over the party.  In 2018, China’s legislature abolished presidential term limits in a ceremonial vote, effectively allowing Xi to rule for life.    CNN’s Sandi Sidhu contributed to this report.

Win McNamee/Getty ImagesCNN      A sweeping cybersecurity breach of congressional members’ private information was more extensive than previously known and affects not only House lawmakers and their staff but also Senate employees.  The Senate sergeant-at-arms alerted Senate staff about the breach Thursday in an email obtained by CNN.  The compromised data is “extensive,” and includes sensitive data such as Social Security numbers, home addresses and information on Senate employees’ health insurance plans, the sergeant-at-arms said in the email, which urged Senate staff to freeze their family credit to guard against fraud.  Law enforcement gave the sergeant-at-arms a list of Senate employees whose data was stolen, the email said, and the sergeant-at-arms was contacting those employees so they could protect themselves from fraud.  Hundreds of US House members and staff also had their personally identifiable information stolen in the breach, which affected a DC health insurance service, CNN reported Wednesday.  Punchbowl News first reported on the sergeant-at-arms’ email.  The revelation that Senate staff also had their data stolen will only increase pressure from Capitol Hill on DC Health Link, the affected insurance service, to provide a full accounting of how the breach occurred.  DC Health Link said Wednesday it had “initiated a comprehensive investigation” of the incident and is working with law enforcement. The FBI is involved in the investigation, the bureau said.  It’s unclear how the data was accessed or who was responsible for the breach, but it immediately raised concerns among lawmakers that they could become the victims of identity theft, as many other Americans have in recent years.   House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have written a letter to DC Health Link expressing their concern over the breach, McCarthy previously told CNN.  Others were less alarmed.  “I can’t get all that worked up about this, honestly,” a Senate staffer told CNN Thursday night.  China “got all my data already in the OPM hack,” the staffer added, referring to the 2014-2015 breach of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised millions of US government personnel records. US officials have blamed Chinese hackers for the breach, a charge Beijing denied.   On a popular cybercrime forum this week, someone claimed to have sold the data belonging to DC Health Link. The advertisement for the stolen data, which CNN reviewed, claimed the leak affected 170,000 people and included Social Security numbers.  CNN was unable to independently verify those claims.

Ex-Goldman banker sentenced to 10 years prison in 1MDB corruption case    			By Reuters  Updated  7:02 PM EST, Thu March 9, 2023    Link Copied!   Ex-Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng and his lawyer Marc Agnifilo leave the federal court in New York, U.S., May 6, 2019.Jeenah Moon/ReutersFormer Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Thursday, after he was convicted of helping loot billions of dollars from Malaysia’s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund.  A jury in Brooklyn federal court last April found Ng, Goldman’s former head of investment banking in Malaysia, guilty of helping his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from the fund, launder the proceeds and bribe government officials to win business.  The charges stem from some $6.5 billion in bonds that Goldman helped 1MDB, which was founded to finance development projects in Malaysia, sell in 2012 and 2013.  U.S. prosecutors said $4.5 billion of that sum was embezzled by officials, bankers and their associates, in one of the biggest scandals in Wall Street history.  Funds were used to buy high-end real estate, jewelry and artwork, and finance the Hollywood film, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” according to the Department of Justice.  U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, who imposed the sentence, said Ng and his co-defendants “effectively stole money” meant for infrastructure and economic development projects to aid the Malaysian people.  “There is a critical need to deter crimes of pure greed like this one,” Brodie said.  The 1MDB scandal also rocked Malaysian politics. Former Prime Minister Najib Razak is serving a 12-year prison sentence after being convicted by a Malaysian court of receiving $10 million from a former 1MDB unit.  Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing.  In a filing last week, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn urged Brodie to sentence Ng to 15 years in prison, calling him a “deeply corrupt banker” and arguing a stiff sentence was necessary to dissuade other financial professionals from bribing officials to win business.  “Foreign corruption undermines the public’s confidence in international markets and institutions,” prosecutors wrote. “It destroys people’s faith in their leaders and it is deeply unfair to everybody else who plays by the rules.”  In his own sentencing request on Feb. 25, Ng asked that he be given no prison time and be allowed to return to Malaysia. He spent six months in a Malaysian prison before waiving his right to contest extradition to the United States in 2018.  Ng had pleaded not guilty and argued that $35 million in kickback payments he was accused of receiving was actually a return on an investment his wife had made.  Leissner had been Goldman’s Southeast Asia chief. He pleaded guilty and testified against Ng as part of a cooperation agreement. He has not yet been sentenced.  Jho Low, a Malaysian financier and suspected mastermind of the scheme, was indicted alongside Ng in 2018 but remains at large. Malaysian officials have said Low is in China, which Beijing denies.  In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay $2.9 billion and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.CNN      Three years after the Covid-19 pandemic changed the lives of all Americans, we are witnessing a retrospective questioning of whether masks—and mask mandates—decrease the risk of Covid-19 spread.   dr kent sepkowitzTo try to clarify the issue, the venerable Cochrane Library led a meta-analysis of available data. Meta-analysis often is used to try to help reconcile conflicting evidence, though the approach has its doubters.  The premise is that, using a strict approach to determine which previous studies are clear enough for inclusion, experts can cobble together the results from years of work done by different investigators and published in different journals. Then, using the bigger statistical punch provided by the many, they can find a significant conclusion not evident in the few.  Cochrane’s study-of-studies, combined with its prestige, has re-animated the pens of a troupe of anti-mask-mandaters including current New York Times columnist Bret Stephens and former New York Times reporter John Tierney.  The “money quote” comes from an interview that esteemed data scientist Dr. Tom Jefferson, the lead author of the Cochrane study, gave in an interview: “There is just no evidence that (masks) make any difference, full stop.” If his statement were an accurate reflection of what the article found, the launching of a thousand op-eds would be understandable.  But this emphatically is not the conclusion of the twelve authors, of which Jefferson was just one voice. The actual Cochrane article concludes something directly at odds with Jefferson’s statement: “The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement, and relatively low adherence with the interventions during the studies hampers drawing firm conclusions… The low to moderate certainty of evidence (in favor of masks) means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and that the true effect may be different from the observed estimate of the effect,” the article notes.    In plain English, this, at least to me as a veteran reader of these types of reviews, translates to: The primary studies are not strong enough for us to say much of anything except that we may be wrong no matter what we say.   A healthcare worker prepares a dose of the Moderna Covid-19 at the Brooklyn Children's Museum vaccination site, serving children six months to 5-Years old, in the Brooklyn borough of New York, US, on Thursday, June 23, 2022. Covid-19 vaccines for children under 5 years old were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday, a welcome relief to parents of the last age group to become eligible for shots. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesNew York City to end vaccine mandate for city workers this weekA lead author such as Jefferson is of course free to speak his mind but, at least in the interview, he apparently did not distinguish his personal view from the consensus view of the authors. There may be a back-story to this: A professor at Oxford University, Jefferson seems to long have had his doubts about masks, writing articles in The Spectator and other journals to air out his sometimes curmudgeonly views.  Given their awareness of his strong personal opinions on the topic, the Cochrane Library, in the section of the recent meta-analysis called “Authors’ Declarations of Interest” writes the following: “TJ (Tom Jefferson): reports declaring an opinion on the topic of the review in articles for popular media. TJ is an Editor at the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections group but was not involved in the editorial process for this review. See full statement here: https://restoringtrials.org/competing-interests-tom-jefferson/.”  Though half of the 12 authors were “not involved in the editorial process,” for this particular article, the additional characterization by Cochrane of Jefferson, the opinionated citizen (“declaring an opinion on the topic … for popular media”), is quite unusual for the medical literature.   Furthermore, several meticulous experts active on social media have unpacked every square inch of the article to reveal many possible flaws in the analysis itself that may have blunted evidence of mask efficacy. This sort of back and forth adopts the tone of “my expert is bigger than your expert” and never leads to any resolution of differences.  Personalities and spokespeople aside, there may be an even larger issue at play here. I have long found the meta-analyses of public health studies such as masking to be uniquely challenging. Meta-analysis seems better suited to randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing this drug to that. The uncertainties in public health studies seem too great for the bigger data of a meta-analysis to overcome.

(Photo by Hector RETAMAL / AFP) (Photo by HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images)HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/AFP via Getty ImagesOpinion: What went right and wrong on CovidFor example, for masking trials, those randomized to wearing a mask or not wearing a mask cannot be blinded: A person in the unmasked arm may have snuck a mask on here and there or conversely, the masked group may have spent a day or two, or ten, unmasked. This introduces enormous and irreducible uncertainty regarding just what is happening.  Plus, focus on this particular meta-analysis—and it alone—is misguided. Other meta-analyses by experts found a “significant protective effect” from masks.  And perhaps most important of all, we have witnessed masks at work over the last three years. Yes, this is anathema to the purists who require evidence, not observation, but how else can we explain the unprecedented low (almost zero) rates of  influenza in the 2020-2021 respiratory season other than by close adherence by the many to the protective measures taken to prevent disease transmission.   Despite all the current kerfuffle, I doubt anyone will change their mind about the issue. Maskers like me will continue to believe and the anti-maskers, though perhaps walking a little taller for a moment, will continue to blame masks for everything from childhood development delays to crashing economies to a dulling of the public sensitivity to the ever-encroaching State that will, when completed, supposedly deprive everyone of all freedoms.  More alarming than the mask debate is to note that this seems to be the latest in a disturbing trend of those with a political ax to grind revisiting the three-year history of the pandemic in a way that needlessly casts doubt or misdirects attention.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Already this year, we have heard that one US agency finds weak evidence that the viral strain that overwhelmed the world was released from a lab in China; we hear ever more about how vaccines are causing a global increase in deaths albeit from a discredited source and we see more focus on the profit motive as an explanation for how the pandemic played out.   Of course, we must look back to learn from our mistakes and make our response to the inevitable next pandemic more effective. Much of the current discussion though seems to involve different groups trying to gain the upper hand of a much larger political—not scientific—debate. And the only thing we can learn from this type of proxy war is this: Everyone who is focused on the politics or media hype of the issue, at the expense of the actual science behind the public health policies, should kindly shut up.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesCNN      The US and its allies have blocked or seized more than $58 billion worth of assets owned or controlled by sanctioned Russians in the past year as Western governments continue to dial up the pressure over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint statement from a multinational sanctions enforcement task force.   The Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force held its sixth multilateral deputies meeting Thursday morning to discuss the group’s continued work and pledge to “redouble” their efforts to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates. The task force is a joint effort between the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, the UK and the European Commission.   “REPO will redouble efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unjust war, countering Russian efforts to undermine, circumvent, or evade REPO’s collective sanctions,” according to a joint statement released following the meeting and obtained first by CNN.   “As Russia’s war of aggression continues, REPO members remain determined in their commitment to impose steep costs on Russia.  REPO will continue to identify, locate, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russians, with the aim of depriving the Kremlin of the funds it needs to fight its illegal war,” it continues.   The task force, which was formed last March, is also taking further steps to crack down on sanctions evasion as the US and its allies work to seal the cracks in a sanctions regime that has weakened but not crippled the Russian economy.   Following Thursday’s meeting, REPO also issued a joint global advisory to help the private sector spot and prevent common sanctions evasion methods, like using family members to maintain access to sanctioned assets, creating complex ownership structures and using third party jurisdictions and false trade information to ship controlled goods, including those that support the Kremlin’s war machine.   “This advisory will contribute to effective sanctions implementation across REPO Task Force members’ jurisdictions by preventing the undermining of financial sanctions, export controls, and other restrictive measures designed and implemented in response to Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine,” the note says.   The US was represented Thursday by Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Marshall Miller, the principal associate deputy attorney general, according to a US Treasury Department official.  The task force has blocked financial assets and seized luxury yachts, high-end real estate and even priceless art, with US officials recovering a possible Fabergé egg from one Russian oligarch’s seized yacht last summer.  But while the task force has generated splashy headlines over the past year by seizing the yachts and homes of Russia’s ultra-rich, a US Treasury official told CNN that REPO provides the governments involved a valuable and streamlined mechanism to apply many of the same tools and best practices for the broader effort to crackdown on sanctions evasion.Over one year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden administration officials are focusing on how to plug the gaps on sanctions evasion, a problem that runs the gamut of adversaries like China and allies like Turkey, India and the United Arab Emirates.   “We will engage companies, banks, regulators, and service providers in a series of jurisdictions we assess are wittingly or unwittingly providing assistance to Russia. This is a broad campaign on which we are working closely with allies and partners,” Elizabeth Rosenberg, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, said last week at the Association of Women in International Trade.   The latest crackdown started in earnest in February on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when the Biden administration announced sanctions for “over 200 individuals and entities, including both Russian and third-country actors across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East that are supporting Russia’s war effort.” Those sanctions were imposed in partnership with the G7 and other allies.  Also on Thursday, the US issued a slew of sanctions against companies involved in a “shadow banking” network established to evade sanctions, as well as entities that are part of a separate China-based network to supply critical parts for Iran’s unmanned aerial vehicle program, which it exports to Russia for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  The US Treasury issued two sets of sanctions as part of its continued efforts to crack down on sanctions evasion networks and undermine efforts to support the Kremlin’s war machine and fund the Iranian regime as both countries forge closer ties.   The first set of sanctions targets 39 companies that make up a “significant ‘shadow banking’” system that helps sanctioned Iranian oil and gas companies access the international financial system and move billions of dollars, according to the Treasury.  The second set of sanctions issued today designate a network of five China-based companies and one employee who support Iran’s UAV procurement network and are responsible for the sale and shipment of “thousands of aerospace components,” according to the Treasury.

President Joe Biden says his budget will reduce deficits by nearly $3 trillion over a decade.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesCNN      President Joe Biden released his annual budget Thursday, outlining his policy priorities for the year ahead.  Make no mistake, the proposed budget has no chance of making it through the Republican-controlled House. But Biden’s plan will frame upcoming political battles on Capitol Hill, where the GOP has yet to unveil its own spending plan.   Biden’s budget comes out after the US hit the debt ceiling, a cap set by Congress, earlier this year. The Treasury Department is now taking extraordinary measures to allow the government to keep paying its bills. But the country could start to default on its obligations over the summer if Congress doesn’t address the debt ceiling before then. Republicans are calling for some spending cuts in exchange for voting to raise the cap, while the White House does not want to negotiate on resolving the debt limit drama.  Interactive: The $31.4 trillion debt dilemmaMany of the provisions in the budget rehash the president’s earlier proposals to expand the social safety net and to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations. He wants to restore the expanded child tax credit and make permanent enhanced Obamacare subsidies, both enacted in the American Rescue Plan in 2021. And he wants to provide universal free preschool, make college more affordable and establish a national paid family and medical leave program, which did not make it into prior packages when the Democrats controlled Congress over the past two years.  Biden’s spending plan also calls for shoring up Medicare and capping the price of insulin for all Americans.  The administration says these proposed policies will result in a nearly $3 trillion reduction in the deficits – the difference between what the government spends and its revenue – over the next decade. Here’s what’s in Biden’s budget proposalPlace a minimum tax on billionaires: The budget includes a 25% minimum tax on all the income of the wealthiest .01% of Americans, including their appreciated assets. It would hit those with a net worth of more than $100 million. Prior efforts to add this type of tax were not successful.  Increase the corporate tax rate: Biden wants to increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate set by the GOP tax cut package in 2017. The budget would also reduce incentives for multinational businesses to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and raise the tax rate on their foreign earnings to 21% from 10.5%. And it would hike the stock buybacks tax enacted last year to 4%, from 1%.  Repealing Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy: Biden’s budget would scrap some tax cuts for certain individuals that were put in place by the Republican’s 2017 tax law.   Biden’s plan would raise the top tax rate to 39.6% from 37%. This would impact single filers making more than $400,000 a year and married couples making more than $450,000 per year, according to the administration.   It also proposes taxing capital gains at the same rate as wage income for those earning more than $1 million, as well as closing the carried interest loophole that allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains – thus lowering their tax rate.  The Biden administration has previously had trouble getting support for these provisions from some Democrats.   Restore the enhanced child tax credit: The budget calls for reviving the expanded child tax credit, which was in place for 2021. It would beef up the credit to $3,600 per child for those under age 6 and $3,000 for older children. It would permanently make the credit fully refundable so more low-income families would qualify.   Improve Medicare’s finances: Biden wants to shore up Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund, known as Part A, by raising taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year and by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for even more drugs.  Medicare, which covers more than 65 million senior citizens and people with disabilities, will only be able to fully pay scheduled benefits until 2028, according to the most recent forecast by its trustees. Biden’s proposal would extend Medicare’s solvency by 25 years or more, according to the White House.  The plan would increase the net investment income tax rate on earned and unearned income above $400,000 to 5%, up from 3.8%. Also, it would be levied on the owners of certain pass-through firms who include business income on their personal tax returns and aren’t currently subject to the tax.  In addition, the measure would dedicate the revenue from the tax, which was created by the Affordable Care Act, to Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund.  Also, the proposal would build on the Inflation Reduction Act, which congressional Democrats passed last summer, by allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation sooner after they launch. And it would extend the law’s requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation to commercial health insurance.  $35 insulin for all Americans: The budget also calls for capping the price of insulin at $35 a month for everyone. The Inflation Reduction Act limited the price of each insulin prescription to $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries as of this year.  Democrats had hoped to extend the provision to those with private insurance as part of last year’s package, but congressional Republicans blocked the measure.  Reduce prescription drug costs for seniors: The budget proposes to limit Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket costs for generic drugs used for certain chronic conditions to no more than $2. Seniors’ costs would also drop if Medicare expanded its drug price negotiations.  Make enhanced Obamacare subsidies permanent: Biden wants to continue the more generous Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire after 2025. The temporary enhancement has beefed up the premium subsidy and allowed more middle-class folks to qualify. The proposal would also provide Medicaid-like coverage to those in states that have not expanded the public health insurance program for low-income Americans.  Increase food security: The budget would provide more than $15 billion to allow more states and schools to provide free school meals to an additional 9 million children.  Reduce maternal mortality: Biden would provide $471 million to reduce maternal mortality rates and expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities. It would also require all states to provide continuous Medicaid postpartum coverage for 12 months, instead of 60 days.  Lower Medicaid spending: The budget would require private insurance companies that provide Medicaid coverage to pay back some money when they charge the program far more than they actually spend on patient care. And it would give the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate additional, supplemental Medicaid drug rebates on behalf of states.  Make college more affordable: The spending plan calls for a $500 increase to the maximum Pell grant, which is awarded to roughly 7 million college students from the lowest-income families annually. Currently, the maximum Pell grant is $7,395 for the 2023-2024 school year. Congress has increased the maximum amount by $900 over the past two years, but the grant historically covered a larger share of the cost of college than it does now.   Biden’s budget would also provide $500 million for a new grant program to help make two years of community college free. And it asks Congress for a $620 million increase in funding for the Office of Federal Student Aid, which processes financial aid forms and helps service student loans. The office did not receive a funding increase this year, despite likely having to support borrowers with restarting payment this summer after a three-year pause.  Universal preschool and affordable child care: The budget would provide funding for a new federal-state partnership program that would provide universal, free preschool. The spending plan would also increase funding for existing federal early care and education programs.   Provide paid family and medical leave: Biden’s budget would establish a national paid family and medical leave program. It would provide 12 weeks of leave for eligible employees to take time off to care for and bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill loved one, heal from their own serious illness, address circumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment, or find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, according to the administration.  Congress provided for some paid sick leave during the Covid-19 pandemic, but lawmakers let the benefit expire in 2021.Address climate change: The spending plan calls for billions of dollars of investment to help address climate change.   For example, money would go toward creating clean-energy jobs and cutting energy bills for families, funding climate research and helping communities become strengthen their infrastructure to withstand floods, wildfires, storms and drought brought on by climate change.  The investments would also help achieve Biden’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% by 2030.  Military defense and support for Ukraine: The proposed budget would provide the US Department of Defense with a 3.2% increase in funding over this year’s level, with an emphasis on countering China and assisting Ukraine.   It would also deliver more than $6 billion, through both the Departments of Defense and State, to Ukraine and other European allies to help fight against Russian aggression.

Read more opinion articles on CNN.CNN      In an attempt to weaken US diplomatic and military influence, Russian President Vladimir Putin has waged a propaganda war to convince other countries that the United States is engaging in a “purposeful, conscious US strategy to destabilize and make chaotic the situation in [Taiwan] and the world.”   Mary E. Lovely Peterson Institute for International EconomicsKatheryn RussPeterson Institute for International EconomicsChinese President Xi Jinping has lined up with Putin on that score, and the US military has warned that China’s parallel campaign of disinformation is intended to create “doubt amongst our allies and partners in the reliability of the United States.”  The Republican majority in the House would be doing Beijing and Moscow’s work for them if they refuse to raise the debt ceiling, sowing irreparable doubt among even our closest allies not just about US financial commitments, but about any promises we have made to other countries.  US Treasury bonds are IOUs to people who have lent the US money. Since the national debt hit its limit in January, the US Treasury has been taking extraordinary measures to cover these bond payments, but is quickly running out of options. If Congress doesn’t lift the debt ceiling, the US could default sometime between July and September, and possibly even sooner.   There are few things that undermine people’s confidence in a partner’s stability and goodwill more than getting stiffed. US bonds have been the world’s premier safe asset for decades, largely due to our reliable repayments, allowing us to borrow from domestic and overseas investors at highly favorable terms even at times of national crisis, such as the 2008 global financial crisis or the recent Covid-19 pandemic.  Even if the United States finds some way to “prioritize” paying allies first, defaulting on any of this debt would undermine the confidence of any country or investor who holds US bonds.    Moreover, our allies account for the majority of externally held US Treasuries. It’s a who’s who of our closest allies in the Pacific, including Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. Also among them are countries of key geostrategic importance in our competition with China, including India, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.   Together, these countries hold roughly $2 trillion in US Treasuries. Other key allies — Australia, Canada, France, Great Britain and Germany — hold more than $1 trillion in US Treasury securities. Stiffing them would irreparably undermine the trust essential to military and diplomatic coordination around the world, putting our national security at risk.  Defaulting on this debt would also weaken our greatest weapon in the new era of unconventional warfare: the ability to freeze large portions of rogue states’ economies through sanctions.

(Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)MANDEL NGAN/AFP/AFP via Getty ImagesOpinion: Hypocrisy to the max on debt ceilingUS sanctions are powerful because of the dominant position of the dollar in the global economy. Global markets price key commodities like oil in dollars, and international payments flow through a global banking system that depends on access to US dollars for transactions.     All of this is at risk if we default. Fear of not getting repaid on time makes US Treasury securities less attractive as a way to hold foreign reserves, reducing the global demand for dollars. This weakening of official dollar purchases would likely increase volatility in the dollar’s value against other currencies and decrease liquidity, prompting investors to reduce their holdings of dollars in any form.   Loss of confidence would filter into other transactions, including the use of the dollar to price contracts for cross-border loans or imports and exports.   In short, failure to raise the debt limit would weaken our national security because it is precisely the world’s trust and confidence that the United States government will pay its debts in full and on time that helps keep the dollar as the world’s dominant currency.  The danger of a US default goes well beyond global finance. Undermining trust in the US would set back any efforts to make our supply chains more secure and resilient. Stronger partnerships with Europe and countries in the Indo-Pacific are central to American efforts to reduce reliance on China for critical supplies.

The current weaponization of US debt obligations by House Republicans is rightly seen by our allies and foes as a major test of the credibility of all of America’s commitments.  As competition for economic alliances heats up around the globe, any congressional delay in raising the US debt limit plays directly into Xi’s and Putin’s hands. The responsible way to control growth in the national debt is by raising taxes and cutting spending in a process of budget negotiations based on good faith. That some in Congress are holding the debt limit hostage to bypass the hard work of budget negotiations creates a national security threat where none should exist.

Video Ad Feedback'Impossible to intercept': This is Russia's new deadly weapon    02:42   - Source:CNNCNN      A Russian bomber fired three hypersonic missiles at the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Monday night, Ukrainian officials said, as part of a barrage that leveled a number of civilian targets including hotels and a shopping mall.   It is not the first time Moscow has deployed its Kinzhal hypersonic missile during its invasion, but it does appear to be a relatively rare occurrence.   Russia said it used Kinzhal missiles Ukraine in mid-March – a claim later confirmed by US officials to CNN – in the first known use of the weapon in combat.  In March, US President Joe Biden confirmed Russia’s use of the Kinzhal missile, describing it as “a consequential weapon … it’s almost impossible to stop it. There’s a reason they’re using it.”  Biden’s defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has downplayed the effectiveness of the missile, telling CBS in March that he “would not see it as a game-changer.”  And the UK defense ministry has previously said the Kinzhal missile is really just an air-launched version of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), which Russia has used repeatedly in its war on Ukraine.  Here’s what to know. Why the fear and hype about hypersonic missiles?First, it’s important to understand the term.   Essentially, all ballistic missiles are hypersonic – which means they travel at least five times the speed of sound. Almost any warhead released from a rocket miles in the atmosphere will reach this speed heading to its target. It is not a new technology.  What military powers – including Russia, China, the United States and North Korea – are working on now is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). An HGV is a highly maneuverable payload that can theoretically fly at hypersonic speed while adjusting course and altitude to fly under radar detection and around missile defenses.  An HGV is the weapon that’s almost impossible to stop. And Russia is thought to have an HGV in its arsenal, the Avangard system, which Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 called “practically invulnerable” to Western air defenses.  A Russian Air Force MiG-31K jet carries a high-precision hypersonic aero-ballistic missile Kh-47M2 Kinzhal during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia on May 9, 2018.Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP/FILEBut the Kinzhal, as a variant of the Iskander SRBM, is not an HGV. While it does have limited maneuverability like the Iskander, its main advantage is that it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions, according to a report last year from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  “The MiG-31K can strike from unpredictable directions and could avoid interception attempts altogether. The flying carrier vehicle might also be more survivable than the road-mobile Iskander system,” the report said.  The same report also noted that the ground-launched Iskander proved vulnerable to missile defense systems during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, during which Azeri forces intercepted an Armenian Iskander.  “This suggests that claims of the Kinzhal’s invulnerability to missile defense systems may also be somewhat exaggerated,” the report said.Does Ukraine have missile defenses?The United States and its NATO allies are already sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense.  According to a senior US official in March, these additional systems included the Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems.  NATO member Slovakia has also sent more modern S-300 missile defense batteries to Ukraine.   In April, the United Kingdom promised £100 million ($123 million) worth of high-grade military equipment, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. Weeks later, Germany said it would supply 50 anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine.   And the US is preparing a mammoth $40 billion aid package that would include additional anti-aircraft capabilities for the Ukrainian military. Why did Putin use the Kinzhal missile?Use in Ukraine marks the combat debut for Russia’s Kinzhal system.  “On March 18, the Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse of missiles and aviation ammunition of Ukrainian troops in the village of Delyatin, Ivano-Frankivsk region,” Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.  (220202) -- WASHINGTON, Feb. 2, 2022 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrives to attend a closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., the United States, on Feb. 2, 2022. The United States will deploy additional troops to Europe, the Defense Department announced Wednesday, citing tensions on Ukraine's borders. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua) (Photo by Xinhua/Sipa USA)Ting Shen/Xinhua/Sipa USAPentagon urges CEOs of largest defense companies to accelerate hypersonic weapons development as US lags behind ChinaUS officials later confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine and were able to track the launches in real time.  The launches in March were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message to the West about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN.  At that point, the war on the ground in Ukraine had become something of a stalemate. Russia may have been looking for victories it could tout.    The UK defense ministry said at the time that Moscow probably deployed the Kinzhal to “detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign.” Austin, the US defense secretary, used similar language in his CBS interview in March, saying Putin was”trying to reestablish some momentum.”  By the end of March, the US assessed that Russian forces were running low on air-launched cruise missiles, according to a US defense official, who said there were indications that Russia was trying to preserve that inventory as part of its declining stocks of precision guided munitions.    Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that virtually all ballistic missiles -- not missiles in general -- are hypersonic.  CNN’s Brad Lendon wrote and reported from Seoul.

Actor Donnie Yen walks to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, before the opening meeting of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on March 4, 2023.VCG/Visual China Group/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      A petition calling for the removal of martial arts star Donnie Yen as a presenter at this year’s Oscar ceremony due to his connections to China’s ruling Communist Party has garnered tens of thousands of signatures.   The 59-year-old actor, best known for his role in ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’ and the hugely popular ‘Ip Man’ franchise, has long been a controversial figure among sections within his native Hong Kong, owing to his apparent criticism of the city’s pro-democracy movement.  Describing Yen as a “supporter of the Chinese Communist regime,” the online petition points to several statements it claims ought to disqualify Yen from involvement in the 95th Academy Awards, which will be held on March 13.  One example listed was a profile published last week in GQ, in which Yen discussed the large and occasionally violent pro-democracy demonstrations that gripped Hong Kong throughout 2019.  “It wasn’t a protest, okay, it was a riot,” Yen told GQ of the demonstrations, which were ultimately suppressed by mass arrests and the introduction of a sweeping national security law by Beijing.  Hong Kong’s government and police, as well as authorities and state media in mainland China, also refer to the demonstrations as “riots,” a phrase pro-democracy supporters reject.  The petition claims Yen’s GQ remarks “not only violate the spirit of freedom of speech but also deny the rights of the people of Hong Kong to fight for their freedom and democracy.”   BEIJING, CHINA - JULY 24: People wear protective masks as they watch a movie in 3D at a theatre on the first day they were permitted to open on July 24, 2020 in Beijing, China.

Here's what changedThe Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied accusations the national security law has stifled  political opposition and criminalized dissent. Instead, it says the law has restored stability to the city after the tumult of the 2019 demonstrations.  The petition was created Saturday by “a group of people from Hong Kong,” according to the details provided, and has since gained more than 84,000 signatures.   “If the Oscars Committee continues to invite such a person as a guest presenter, it will damage the image and reputation of the film industry and cause serious harm to human rights and moral values,” the petition reads.  Last weekend, Yen was seen in attendance at a key Communist Party meeting in Beijing as part of an advisory body on arts and culture.   Speaking to press at the event, Yen said more Chinese action movies were needed to “become the pride of China” and “tell the story of China,” according to state-run Global Times.   The Oscars has not publicly commented on the petition. CNN has reached out to the Oscars for comment.  When contacted by CNN, Yen’s representative declined to provide a statement.  It’s not the first time Yen has attracted controversy among pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong. He was previously criticized after performing next to Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2017, an event Yen called a “great honor,” and for celebrating Hong Kong’s return “to motherland China” in 2020 on the anniversary of the city’s handover.   These incidents prompted many in Hong Kong to call for the boycotts of his recent films – “Ip Man 4” in 2019, and “Mulan” in 2020.  Yen seemed to acknowledge his critics in the GQ interview, saying: “A lot of people might not be happy for what I’m saying, but I’m speaking from my own experience.”  He is set to present the Oscars ceremony alongside other prominent actors and performers including Riz Ahmed, Emily Blunt, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson.

Europe joins the US in its chip war with China    			By Juliana Liu and Wayne Chang, CNN		  Published  7:11 AM EST, Thu March 9, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackUS Amb. to Japan urges China to 'respect' other countries in the region    02:36   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      Europe’s biggest producer of advanced chipmaking technology has joined the United States in its escalating standoff with China.  The Netherlands announced Wednesday, via a letter from its trade minister to parliament, that new restrictions on overseas sales of semiconductor technology were needed to protect national security.  While the letter didn’t name ASML Holdings, Europe’s biggest tech firm, the curbs will affect the Dutch company, which is a key supplier to global chipmakers, including those in China.   The announcement marks the first public move by the Dutch government toward adopting rules, advocated by Washington, to restrict China’s chipmaking industry.   Japan has also been involved in three-way discussions with the Netherlands and the United States, a source familiar with the talks told CNN. Reuters reported that Tokyo is expected to issue an update on its policies on chip equipment exports as soon as this week.  Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, takes part in a deliberation with his fellow deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu Province, at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress NPC in Beijing, capital of China, March 5, 2023. Li Xueren/Xinhua/Getty ImagesXi Jinping hits out at US as he urges China's private firms to 'fight' alongside Communist PartyChina said Thursday it “firmly opposes” the Netherlands’ upcoming curbs, which come just months after the United States restricted sales of some semiconductor machinery to Beijing. For those measures to really bite, Washington needs other important suppliers, located in the Netherlands and Japan, to join.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning accused “certain countries” of “coercing and inducing other countries to take export restriction measures against China at the expense of their allies’ interests.”  She didn’t name the United States, but Chinese officials often use the term “certain countries” or “some countries” when making critical comments about Washington.  “We hope the Netherlands won’t follow some countries in abusing export control measures,” Mao said. “China will take all necessary countermeasures to protect our legitimate rights and interests.”  This week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping hit out at the United States with unusually direct comments as he called on China’s private companies to “fight” alongside the Communist Party at a time of mounting challenges. He accused Western countries led by the United States of trying to “contain” and “suppress” China.   Beijing has set a target for China to become a global leader in a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence, 5G wireless technology and quantum computing.Intensifying competitionIn October, those plans came up against a major obstacle when the Biden administration banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license. It also restricted the ability of American citizens to provide support for the development or production of chips at certain manufacturing facilities in China.  Chips are vital for everything from smartphones and self-driving cars to advanced computing and weapons manufacturing.

Customers such as TSMC, Samsung    (SSNLF) and China’s SMIC use the Dutch company’s equipment to mass-produce microchips.   “These new export controls focus on advanced chip manufacturing technology, including the most advanced deposition and immersion lithography tools,” ASML said in a statement. “Due to these upcoming regulations, ASML will need to apply for export licenses for shipment of the most advanced immersion … systems.”  It added that it didn’t expect the upcoming measures to have a material effect on its 2023 financial outlook. The company has mainly sold “mature” products to China.European battlegroundThe announcement of the Netherlands’ export restrictions, the details of which are expected to be confirmed before the summer, isn’t the first time the US-China tech rivalry spilled over into Europe.   Two European semiconductor deals ran into trouble last year over links with Beijing, in a sign of concern spreading in the West over potential Chinese control of critical infrastructure.

Photographer: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesHollie Adams/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe US-China chip war is spilling over to EuropeIn November, the new owner of Britain’s biggest chipmaker was ordered to unwind its takeover, just days after another chip factory sale was blocked in Germany. Both transactions were hit by national security concerns, and had involved acquisitions by Chinese-owned companies.  In the United Kingdom, Nexperia, a Dutch subsidiary of Shanghai-listed semiconductor maker Wingtech, was told by the government to sell at least 86% of its stake in Newport Wafer Fab, more than a year after taking control of the factory. Staffers have since protested the decision, saying it puts nearly 600 jobs at risk.  In Germany, the economic ministry barred Elmos Semiconductor, an automotive chipmaker, from selling its factory in the city of Dortmund to Silex, a Swedish subsidiary of China’s Sai Microelectronics.  The failed deals illustrate how, at a time of escalating US-China tensions, Europe is also under growing pressure to act, particularly as officials face US calls for key sectors to be kept out of Chinese control.  — CNN’s Laura He and Michelle Toh contributed to this report RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Pickleball is America’s fastest-growing sport.

Victoria Gray is pictured here at the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing in London on Monday. The Royal SocietySign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.LondonCNN      For most of her life, Victoria Gray, a 37-year-old mother of four from Mississippi, had experienced excruciating bouts of pain.   Born with the blood disorder sickle cell disease, lengthy hospital stays and debilitating fatigue disrupted her childhood, forcing her to quit pursuing a college nursing degree and take potent and addictive painkillers.  “The pain I would feel in my body was like being struck by lightning and hit by a freight train all at once,” she said this week at the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing in London.  In 2019, she received an experimental treatment for the inherited disease that used the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, which allowed doctors to make very precise changes to her DNA. While the procedure itself was grueling and took seven to eight months to fully recover from, she said it has transformed her life.  “The feeling is amazing. I really feel that I’m cured now,” Gray said. “Because I no longer have to face the battles that I faced on a day-to-day (basis). I came from having to have an in-home caregiver to help me take baths, clean my house and care for my children. Now I do all those things on my own.”   She’s now able to enjoy a life she once felt was passing her by. She holds down a full-time job as a Walmart cashier, and she’s able to attend her children’s football games and cheerleading events and enjoy family outings. “The life I felt I was just existing in I’m now thriving in,” she said.  Gray shared her experience with doctors, scientists, patient advocates and bioethicists who gathered in London for the human genome editing summit, at which participants reported on advances made in the field and debated the thorny ethical issues posed by the cutting-edge technology.    “I’m here really to be a light because there’s mixed feelings about gene editing. And I think people can see the positive result of it. You know that a person who was once suffering in life, was miserable, now is able to be a part of life and enjoy it,” Gray told CNN.   He Jiankui presents a slide during a speech at the 2018 international summit on human genome editing in Hong Kong, China.Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Baby scandal lingersGray’s uplifting story, which received a standing ovation from the audience, stood in contrast to a presentation made the last time the conference was held, in Hong Kong in 2018, when Chinese doctor He Jiankui stunned his peers and the world with the revelation that he had created the world’s first gene-edited babies.   The two girls grew from embryos He had modified using CRISPR-Cas9, which he said would make them resistant to HIV. His work was widely condemned by the scientific community, which decried the experiment as medically unnecessary and ethically irresponsible. He received a three-year jail sentence in 2019. Questions about the baby scandal still linger more than four years later, and after being recently released from prison, He is reportedly seeking to continue his work. China has tightened its regulation of experimental biomedical research since 2018, but it hasn’t gone far enough, said Joy Zhang, a medical sociologist at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom.   “Ethical governance in practice is still confined to traditional medical, scientific, as well as educational, establishments. The new measures fail to directly address how privately funded research and other … ventures will be monitored,” Zhang said at the conference.  Ethically questionable experimental research isn’t an issue confined to China, said Robin Lovell-Badge, head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who chaired the 2018 Hong Kong conference session in which He attempted to defend his work.    “(He Jiankui) is not the only concern in this area. One of our big concerns I always have is the possibility that there will be rogue companies, rogue scientists setting up to do genome editing in an inappropriate way,” Lovell-Badge said on Monday at the conference.   Gray shared her story at Monday's conference.The Royal Society    Hopes and fears around gene editingWhile the CRISPR baby scandal tarnished the technology’s reputation, CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques have made a major impact on biomedical research,  and two scientists behind the tool — Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna — won a Nobel prize for their work in 2020. “Clinical trial results demonstrate that CRISPR is safe, and it’s effective for treating and curing human disease — an extraordinary advance given the technology is only 10 years old,” Doudna said at the conference in a video address. “It’s important with a powerful technology like this to grapple with the challenges of responsible use.”  In addition to the sickle cell trial that includes Gray, clinical trials are also underway to test the safety of gene editing in treating several other conditions, including a related blood disorder called beta thalassemia; leber congenital amaurosis, which is a form of inherited childhood blindness; blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma; type 1 diabetes; and HIV/AIDS.  DNA acts as a instruction manual for life on our planet, and CRISPR-Cas9 can target sites in plant and animal cells using guide RNA to get the Cas-9 enzyme to a more precise spot on a strand of DNA. This allows scientists to change DNA by knocking out a particular gene or inserting new genetic material at a predetermined site in the strand.   People with sickle cell disease have abnormal hemoglobin in red blood cells that can cause them to get hard and sticky, clogging blood flow in small vessels.   In the trial that Gray was part of, doctors increased the production of a different kind of hemoglobin, known as fetal hemoglobin, which makes it harder for cells to sickle and stick together. The process is invasive and involves removing premature cells from the bone marrow and modifying them — by using CRISPR-Cas9 in the lab — to eventually produce fetal hemoglobin. The patient has to undergo a round of chemotherapy before receiving the gene-edited cells to ensure the body doesn’t reject them.  The conference also shed light on new, more sophisticated gene-editing techniques, such as prime editing and base editing, which recently was used to modify immune cells and successfully treat a teen with treatment-resistant leukemia. These next generation techniques will allow humans “to have some say in the sequence of our genomes so we are no longer so beholden to the misspellings in our DNA,” said David Liu, the Richard Merkin professor and director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies in Healthcare at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University.  The gene therapy trials currently underway involve treating people who were born with a certain disease or condition by altering non-reproductive cells in what’s known as somatic gene editing.  The next frontier — many would say red line — is heritable gene editing: altering the genetic material in human sperm, eggs or embryos so that it can be safely passed onto the next generation. The goal would be to prevent babies from inheriting genetic diseases.  A researcher handles a petri dish while observing a CRISPR/Cas9 process through a stereomicroscope at the Max-Delbrueck-Centre for Molecular Medicine in 2018.Gregor Fischer/picture alliance/Getty Images“It’s a very different set of ethical trade-offs when you’re not a treating disease in an existing individual but you’re in fact preventing an individual yet to be born from suffering from a disease. That’s a very different set of considerations,” said George Daley, Caroline Shields Walker Professor of Medicine and dean of the faculty of medicine at Harvard Medical School.  In a statement released at the end of the conference, the organizers said “heritable human genome editing remains unacceptable at this time.”  They added that public discussion and policy debates should continue and were important for resolving whether this technology should be used. CRISPR access and equityThe hope offered by gene therapy is creating fresh ethical storms — primarily over who gets access to such treatments. The therapy Gray received, which is expected to soon receive regulatory approval, is likely to cost more than $2 million per person, putting it out of reach for many who need it in the United States and in low-income countries.   “If we want to be serious about equitable access to these kinds of therapies, we have to start talking early on about ways to develop them and make them available and make them cost effective and sustainable,” said Alta Charo, the Warren P. Knowles Professor Emerita of Law and Bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.   Researchers want to develop CRISPR therapies that can be delivered though an injection rather than the  chemotherapy and invasive bone marrow transplant Gray went through.   Worldwide, more than 300,000 children are born with sickle cell disease every year, over 75% of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, where screening programs and treatment options are limited. Even relatively affordable drugs to treat sickle cell disease, such as hydroxyurea, don’t reach everyone who needs them in India, said Gautam Dongre, the secretary of the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Organizations in India and father of two children with sickle cell disease.  “After 40 years if these drugs aren’t reachable for the common people, then what about gene therapy?” Dongre asked at the conference.  Julie Makani, an associate professor in the department of haematology and blood transfusion at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences in Tanzania, said more genomic research should take place in Africa.   “The ultimate thing for me, particularly as a physician scientist, is not just discovery, but also seeing the application of knowledge…into (an) improvement in health,” Makani said.

The nation's newest and most advanced nuclear-powered attack submarine and the lead ship of its class, PCU Virginia returns to the General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard on July 30, 2004. General Dynamics Electric Boat/US NavyCNN      Australia plans to purchase at least four nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines from the United States, three sources familiar with the matter said, part of an emerging defense partnership widely viewed as a bid to counter China’s military ambitions in the Pacific.  Delivery of the submarines isn’t likely for years, potentially into the 2030s, but the expected announcement will act as a demonstration of progress by the AUKUS grouping, comprised of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese addressed the plan, which Reuters first reported, at a news event in Ahmedabad, India, on Wednesday.  While he did not provide details of the plan, he emphasized that his country will retain “absolute sovereignty” when it comes to control of nuclear-powered submarines acquired through the AUKUS partnership.   Asked by a journalist whether “Australia will retain full operational control of submarines, or could they be commanded by Americans,” Albanese said: “Australia will retain absolutely our sovereignty, our absolute sovereignty, 100%.”   The Virginia-class is the latest fast attack submarine in the Navy, intended to replace the aging fleet of Los Angeles-class submarines. Unlike the ballistic missile submarines, which are part of the US nuclear arsenal, fast attack submarines can employ a number of different weapons, including torpedoes and cruise missiles. The submarines can also carry special operations forces and carry out intelligence and reconnaissance missions.  Australia is also expected to work with the United Kingdom on developing a new class of nuclear-powered submarine, which could include US parts, the sources said, as the three countries move ahead with the defense partnership.  President Joe Biden will host the prime ministers of Australia and the United Kingdom in California next week to discuss the next steps in the partnership.  After announcing the AUKUS partnership in 2021, officials from the three countries have been working through plans to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, including legal issues in transferring classified technology and how to train Australian sailors on the submarines.  As part of the announcement, US submarines are likely to increase their visits to Australian ports in the coming years, before the eventual delivery of the new Australian submarines.  In purchasing US Virginia-class submarines while also developing submarines based on a British model, both the US and UK’s industrial bases will stand to benefit.  The AUKUS partnership is meant as a way to increase security in the Pacific region amid escalating tensions with China.  In San Diego on Monday, Biden is expected to discuss the plan with Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Both will be visiting the United States for the first time since assuming their roles. San Diego hosts a large US naval presence, including submarines, for the Pacific Fleet.  Negotiations have been ongoing for more than a year on the nuclear-powered submarines, which caused consternation when they were announced because it scuttled Australia’s plans to purchase conventional submarines from France.  Biden at the time called the rollout of the AUKUS submarine plan “clumsy.”  This story has been updated with additional information.   CNN’s Angus Watson contributed to this report.

Sign up here.Hong KongCNN      After three years of largely self-imposed isolation on the global stage, China is aiming to up its diplomatic offensive and win back lost ground – all while hardening its public stance toward its superpower rival, the United States.   Qin Gang, Beijing’s new foreign minister, on Tuesday declared that “China’s diplomacy has pressed the ‘accelerator button,’” citing the country’s recovery from the pandemic and its resumption of international exchanges.  That outreach will be boosted by a 12.2% increase in the Chinese government’s budget for diplomatic expenditure this year. It’s a drastic jump from the zero-Covid era that saw China’s borders mostly shut: In 2020, China slashed its diplomacy budget by 11.8%, before a mild 2.4% increase in 2022.    This year’s budget, pegged at 54.84 billion yuan (about $8 billion), remains below the pre-pandemic peak, but experts say it marks a significant increase for China to resume and expand its diplomatic engagement with the world. In comparison, in the US, the requested 2023 budget for “international affairs” listed on the State Department’s website was $67 billion.  And the money will be used not only to fund diplomatic trips. According to China’s Ministry of Finance, the umbrella term “diplomatic expenditure” covers a wide range of areas, from budgets for the Foreign Ministry, Chinese embassies and consulates, to China’s participation in international organizations, foreign aid and external propaganda.  Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, noted that China is likely to increase its spending on propaganda efforts targeting foreign audiences to service Beijing’s diplomatic interests – including through Chinese social media apps.  “For example, they try to extend influence in different countries, such as Singapore and Malaysia, through WeChat, targeting those who speak the Chinese language,” Wu said.  Experts also question whether some of the increase is due to the debt stress and repayment problems faced by countries under Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s signature overseas development initiative, known as the Belt and Road.

Yue Yuewei/Xinhua/Getty Images“Even if the interest and principal repayment is suspended, it still creates a large hole,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.   This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road, and Chinese leaders will likely travel the world to talk up its successes, Sun said. “That usually means more diplomatic expenditures such as aid and gift packages,” she said.  China is set to host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year, after a long delay due to the pandemic. It will also host the first in-person summit between Xi and leaders from five Central Asian countries.  “China wishes to catch up and do more to make up for the lost time and opportunities,” Sun said.  And China has a lot of catching up to do, at least in terms of stabilizing relations with developed countries.  Global surveys by the Pew Research Center have shown that public opinion toward China in advanced economies has turned “precipitously more negative” since 2017, due to concerns about Beijing’s human rights record and military buildup in the South China Sea, with the most dramatic declines between 2019 and 2020.   Since the pandemic, opinions have only deteriorated further, partly due to perceptions that China had mishandled the initial Covid outbreak in Wuhan, according to a Pew survey published last year.Sharpening rhetoric toward the USA notable shift in China’s diplomatic endeavors is a more forceful approach in publicly pushing back against the US – from the very top of the Chinese leadership.  In unusually direct remarks Monday, Xi accused the US of leading a campaign to suppress China and causing its serious domestic woes.  “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,” Xi told a group of government advisers representing private businesses on the sidelines of an annual legislative meeting in Beijing.  China’s top leader usually avoids directly attacking the US in public even as bilateral relations have deteriorated sharply. He generally refers only to “Western countries” or “some developed nations” when making critical comments about Washington.  Xi’s blunt rebuke of US policy was echoed Tuesday by Qin, the foreign minister, who said US competition with China is in fact all about “containment and suppression” and “a zero-sum game of life and death.”  “If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” Qin warned.  To longtime observers of Chinese politics, the sharpened rhetoric rings alarm bells for already tense US-China relations, with no off-ramp in sight for deescalation.  “It sure feels like the (Chinese) side has decided to level up in responding much more forcefully to what it sees as unfair US accusations and actions,” wrote Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter.  Now that Xi – the most powerful Chinese leader in decades – has lashed out at the US directly, China’s entire officialdom and propaganda machine are expected to take note and rigorously follow.   Temperatures are not likely to cool in Washington, either, given the consensus across the aisle to be tough on China and hardening American public perceptions. According to a Gallup poll released Tuesday, a record-low 15% of Americans view China favorably in 2023, a 5% fall from last year and a 38% decrease since 2018. More than eight in 10 US adults now hold a negative opinion of China, the poll said.  “Expect US-China to get worse faster,” Bishop wrote. “I fear we are entering into a much more dangerous period in US-China relations.”  Chinese leader Xi Jinping attends a session during the G20 Summit in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on November 16, 2022. Willy Kurniawan/AFP/Getty Images/File    ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy? Since late last year, some observers have noted Beijing’s softening tone on foreign affairs as it upped its diplomacy with Western governments, following Xi’s flurry of meetings with Western leaders at the G20 summit in Indonesia.  The demotion of combative foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian and the promotion of Qin – a measured former ambassador to the US – to foreign minister had been seen by some as a signal China was moving away from “wolf warrior” diplomacy, the aggressive style adopted by Beijing’s envoys in recent years.  When asked about that perceived shift Tuesday, Qin criticized “wolf warrior” diplomacy as a “narrative trap.”  “Those who coined the term and set the trap either know little about China and its diplomacy, or have a hidden agenda in disregard of facts,” Qin said. “In China’s diplomacy, there is no shortage of goodwill and kindness. But if faced with jackals or wolves, Chinese diplomats would have no choice but to confront them head-on and protect our motherland.”  To Sun, the expert at Stimson Center, the tone of Qin’s remarks did not come as a surprise – it simply aligns with China’s established lines on foreign policy, she said. “I think it is assertive and spiky, but not as aggressive as wolf warrior diplomacy was.”  Wu, the expert in Singapore, meanwhile, said he hadn’t observed much of a mellowing in Beijing’s diplomatic outreach. “Qin Gang may be a bit softer than Wang Yi,” he said, referring to Qin’s predecessor who was recently promoted as Xi’s top foreign policy adviser.   “But Wang is the No.1 official in diplomacy. They are still following Xi’s instruction to show their ‘fighting spirits’ – to go out proactively to fight hostile forces against China.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Dutch to restrict semiconductor tech exports to China, joining US effort    			By Reuters  Published  8:49 PM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   The ASML Holding NV global headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, on Friday, October 14, 2022. Peter Boer/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileAmsterdam/WashingtonReuters      The Netherlands’ government on Wednesday said it plans new restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to protect national security, joining the US effort to curb chip exports to China.  The announcement marked the first concrete move by the Dutch, who oversee essential chipmaking technology, toward adopting rules urged by Washington to hobble China’s chipmaking industry and slow its military advances.  The US in October imposed sweeping export restrictions on shipments of American chipmaking tools to China, but for the restrictions to be effective it needs other key suppliers in the Netherlands and Japan, who produce key chipmaking technology, to agree. The allied countries have been in talks on the matter for months.  ASML Holding logo is seen at company's headquarters in Eindhoven, Netherlands, January 23, 2019.Eva Plevier/ReutersASML says 'rules are being finalized' on chip export controls to ChinaDutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher announced the decision in a letter to parliament, saying the restrictions will be introduced before the summer.  Her letter did not name China, a key Dutch trading partner, nor did it name ASML Holding    (ASML), Europe’s largest tech firm and a major supplier to semiconductor manufacturers, but both will be affected. It specified one technology that will be impacted is “DUV” lithography systems, the second-most advanced machines that ASML sells to computer chip manufacturers.  “Because the Netherlands considers it necessary on national security grounds to get this technology into oversight with the greatest of speed, the Cabinet will introduce a national control list,” the letter said.  A White House representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Commercial impactASML said in a response it expects to have to apply for licenses to export the most advanced segment among its DUV machines, but that would not impact its 2023 financial guidance.  ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, multimillion dollar machines that use powerful lasers to create the minute circuitry of computer chips.  The company expects sales in China to remain about flat at 2.2 billion euros in 2023, implying relative shrinkage as the company expects overall sales to grow by 25%. Major ASML customers such as TSMC and Intel    (INTC) are engaged in capacity expansions.  ASML has never sold its most advanced “EUV” machines to customers in China, and the bulk of its “DUV” sales in China go to relatively less advanced chipmakers. Its biggest South Korean customers, Samsung    (SSNLF) and SK Hynix both have significant manufacturing capacity in China.  The Dutch announcement leaves major questions unanswered, including whether ASML will be able to service the more than 8 billion euros worth of DUV machines it has sold to customers in China since 2014.  Schreinemacher said the Dutch government had decided on measures “as carefully and precisely as possible … to avoid unnecessary disruption of value chains.”  “It is for companies of importance to know what they are facing and to have time to adjust to new rules,” she wrote.  Japan is expected to issue an update on its chip equipment export policies as soon as this week.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles on CNN.CNN      Last summer, I became a somewhat infamous figure on TikTok when a video I posted pitching myself to be on “Saturday Night Live” went viral — but not in the way I’d hoped. At first I was mocked en masse and parodied, but the conversation quickly veered into vitriol and outright venom, resulting in a lengthy bullying campaign that included calls for me to kill myself.  Jake NovakBradford RogneTikTok has been at the center of the national conversation as of late, with lawmakers proposing a nationwide ban on the popular video-sharing app over fears that the China-based company may be harvesting American users’ private data.   But as an online creator, I believe that the real, undeniable problem with social media is that harassment and hatred can spread on platforms like TikTok on an enormous scale with alarming speed — and it severely imperils the mental health of creators and everyday users alike.   It’s incumbent on social media companies to strengthen their content moderation practices to limit this behavior, and to ensure they do, the federal government should mandate more effective procedures to curtail the way hate can rapidly escalate online.  In the wake of the “SNL” post, my notifications were inundated with cruel comments and snide videos, from calls to action for users to bully me off the platform, to suggestions that I had not been bullied enough as a child. And when they’d had their fill on TikTok, these trolls found me on Instagram and YouTube — and even my inactive Twitter — and bombarded me with more nasty comments, tweets and videos. Altogether, the content made about me swiftly amassed millions of views and likes.   I immediately stopped posting on social media, and when my absence was noticed, the commentary changed to flippant musings wondering if the negative attention had caused me to kill myself, spawning the hashtag #RIPJakeNovak. Some users, perhaps emboldened by the hashtag, emailed me directly to tell me I should end my life if I hadn’t already.  This was my reality for months — all because of a video I posted that people thought wasn’t funny.  Elva Etienne/Moment RF/Getty ImagesOpinion: This may be the only way to stop social media from harming our kidsSocial media creators are all too aware that the platforms that give them their creative outlet, and in many cases their livelihood, can turn hostile on them at any moment. Horror stories of users being mercilessly hectored and doxxed — where identifying information like physical addresses is published on the internet, usually maliciously — are far too common. And recently, there has been an uptick in swatting, where individuals falsely accuse someone of a made-up crime with the goal of sending armed police to their home, a prank that can turn fatal.  My version of this came when users discovered I worked as a performer at Disneyland and began coming there to film me and post the videos on TikTok. The captions often referenced the fact that I was alive, usually with bemusement or faux relief. But on the other side of the lens, I grew to fear more than what these people were saying about me.   Several of my coworkers received a message on Instagram that seemed to threaten my life, which meant that each video of me “in the wild” was not just a potential source of humiliation, but a beacon letting the entire internet — including those who wished me harm — know my location in real-time. Yet there was no recourse to be taken: I was in a public position that allowed, even encouraged, anyone who wanted to film me at will. I was alone and exposed and scared.  But I still had to go to work. Every performance, my anxiety was through the roof, wondering if that person who shouted my name was just being a harmless jerk or planned to follow me in the parking lot. That fear stayed with me outside of my workplace, too: at restaurants, grocery stores, the car wash. I slept on friends’ couches because I was afraid someone might have found my home address. I couldn’t be sure how far it would go.  Is the Chinese government using TikTok to invade Americans’ privacy for political gain? Who knows. Are Americans using social media to harass their fellow Americans? You betcha.  TikTok’s community guidelines pledge intolerance for users being “shamed, bullied, or harassed,” acknowledging that such content “can cause severe psychological distress.” The platform claims to take down videos for harassment — many before they’re even reported — and that is a good start. Some harassing comments and videos about me have indeed been removed in recent months. But that wasn’t before they got to me — and potentially influenced the creation of other harassing comments and videos.  I did not reach out to any social media platforms to report the bullying I received; even if I had, it was so widespread that I wouldn’t have known where to start. Instead, in the interest of preventing that disturbing hashtag from coming true, I deleted all social apps from my phone. I have yet to reinstall them.  The US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2023. Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesOpinion: The Supreme Court could end social media companies' charadeI’m aware that as an entertainer — and an internet creator, especially — I am subject to people having and sharing opinions about me and my work. But what started as discussion about me turned into pointed attacks toward me. The former is discourse, which is very much within the scope of acceptable behavior toward a public figure; the latter is harassment, which is very much not.  But not all who experience cyberbullying are internet personalities who have opened themselves up to public critiques. Many targets are everyday users who find themselves unwillingly thrust into an antagonizing spotlight, and the effects can be devastating.   A 2018 review of 26 independent studies that were published between 1996 and 2017 (TikTok was released in September 2016) found that adults and young people are more than 2.5 times as likely to attempt suicide when they’ve faced online bullying, and the CDC says that levels of sadness and thoughts of suicide among teen girls have “increased dramatically” over the past decade. The same 2021 study notes that 16% of high school students surveyed by the CDC said that they had been “electronically bullied” through social media or over text in the past year.   We saw a tragic convergence of this just last month, when 14-year-old Adriana Kuch died by suicide two days after a clip of her being assaulted at her New Jersey high school was shared on TikTok. She told her father before she died that she didn’t want to be “that girl who gets beat up on video and made fun of.”  Social media companies are not without the tools to address the persecution that can proliferate on their platforms, yet they seem to not use them as well as they should.   Some sites reportedly utilize a form of “shadow-banning,” when the reach of a post is inhibited for community violations, but the practice is famously opaque and algorithms can misinterpret allowed content as verboten. Companies like Meta, parent of Facebook and Instagram, employ scores of human moderators who screen content around the clock, yet the moderators say they have made judgment mistakes due to confusing and constantly changing policies. Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council, which advised on issues including suicide prevention and mental health, was disbanded late last year. It doesn’t take much to understand why stories like mine — and many far more heartbreaking — pervade the online zeitgeist.  Perhaps unexpectedly, I don’t want TikTok to be banned — in fact, I hope it won’t be. I loved being a creator: the grind of making videos all the time, the challenge to push myself in new directions on a dime, the thrill of watching strangers around the world connect with a song I wrote minutes after filming it in my bedroom. I loved seeing the work fellow creators would make and feeling inspired by it. I miss TikTok. Before it was terrifying, it was exhilarating.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook That was the promise of social media: a place where we can go to talk and share and laugh and think and come together. These are digital spaces where everyone is purported to feel welcome, yet I and so many others continue to flee them for fear of our physical safety. These platforms have had close to two decades to deliver on their promise and have failed again and again. Perhaps it is time to stop hoping that they will.   Senator Marco Rubio said recently that “The federal government has yet to take a single meaningful action to protect American users from the threat of TikTok.” But if legislation to ban the app because of Chinese privacy concerns passes, that statement will still hold true. Even if TikTok disappears from American life altogether, online hate and bullying will persist on other platforms until the government mandates stronger, broader and more efficient content moderation on social media specifically designed to protect us from harassment.  To the potential chagrin of those whose posts cheered it, my story thankfully did not end with suicide. But it’s all too clear that the next victim’s tale could have a much more lethal conclusion — in fact, it already did.  Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: Call or text 988.

Gen. Laura Richardson speaks during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, March 8.House Armed Services CommitteeCNN      Senior US generals issued stark warnings to lawmakers about what they described as an “aggressive” expansion of Chinese influence in South America and the Caribbean encroaching on American interests in the region.  “The [People’s Republic of China] has the capability and intent to eschew international norms, advance its brand of authoritarianism, and amass power and influence at the expense of these democracies,” Gen. Laura Richardson, commander of US Southern Command, said on Wednesday. “The PRC has expanded its ability to extract resources, establish port, manipulate governments through predatory investment practices, and build potential dual-use space facilities — the most space facilities in any combatant command region.”   Indeed, Richardson and Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of US Northern Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that China’s expansion has included increased work on the Belt and Road Initiative, a massive international infrastructure project that seeks to expand Chinese influence around the world, as well as “economic coercion” in the Bahamas and “investment” on South American projects.  “We’ve got to pay more attention to this region,” Richardson said. “The proximity matters. They are on the 20-yard line of our homeland. We are in a neighborhood, these are our neighbors, and we have got to pay attention to them.”  American officials have voiced similar concerns about Chinese activities in other regions of the world including Africa as Beijing looks to compete with Washington not just militarily but also economically and in terms of soft power.

W DIA Director General Paul Nakasone National Security Agency NSATom Williams/CQ Roll Call/APUS intel chiefs say China likely to press Taiwan and seek to undercut USIn the Caribbean, China is “very aggressive” in the Bahamas, VanHerck said, where they have built the largest embassy in the world complete with an ambassador who “uses the information space to undermine us each and every day.”   He added that the US has not had a permanent ambassador to the Bahamas since 2011, and appointing one would “vastly help.”  VanHerck also noted that there is “significant” investment from China in Mexico, and that 80% of Mexico’s telecommunications is provided by Chinese companies.  Richardson added that while the US also has a “lot of investment” in South America, the US does not advertise it enough. And while many of those countries will seek contracts for big projects, she said, they only see “PRC and Chinese bidders,” which makes them feel they’ve “got no choice” but to work with China.  At the same time, however, Richardson said China’s investments do not actually benefit countries in the region and claimed Beijing is “taking advantage” of South American nations by pushing them into a “debt trap associated with the multiple loans” they provide.  The reflection of pedestrians is seen in a billboard advertising Chinese video app TikTok at Wangfujing street on August 20, 2020 in Beijing, China. VCG/Getty ImagesTikTok could be a valuable tool for China if it invades Taiwan, FBI director says“They don’t invest in the country, the extract … they bring their own workers, Chinese laborers, to the country and build these high-rise apartments. So the investing, you don’t see the investment in the country,” she said.  The hearing comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China, following the shootdown of a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina last month, and reports that China is considering assisting Russia in its war against Ukraine.  Chinese officials have denied claims that they are considering providing lethal military aid to Russia, but US officials have maintained that China would face “real costs” if they went forward with the support.  China has also denied that the balloon shot down off the US coast into the Atlantic Ocean was a surveillance balloon. But on Wednesday, VanHerck said the event displayed “one of the ways our competitors target us each and every day.”   “Candidly, the internal discord of this event just showed one of the ways our competitors target us each and every day in the information space,” VanHerck said, “and they’re becoming increasingly adept at driving wedges between the American people.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

The German sportswear maker said Wednesday that it would face an operating loss of €700 million ($736 million) this year— its first in 31 years — because of a potential €500 million ($527 million) hit related to unsold Yeezy stock, and the cost of a strategic review.   Shares in Adidas    (ADDDF) fell 2.2% Wednesday morning after it published its 2022 results and outlook for 2023.   The company broke off its lucrative nine-year partnership with Yeezy designer Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, in October.   Adidas said last month that its annual revenue could plunge by €1.2 billion ($1.27 billion) this year as a direct result of the split, which came after Ye made a series of antisemitic remarks.  The rupture knocked around €600 million ($633 million) off the company’s fourth-quarter revenue, Adidas said Wednesday.   But the controversy has appeared to fuel demand for Yeezy sneakers through other sellers. Last week, John Mocadlo, chief executive of Impossible Kicks, a large online reseller of high-end sneakers and clothing, said demand for the shoes had surged 30% since around last October.   Adidas could perform better this year if it “repurposes” some of its Yeezy products, the company said without elaborating. ‘Year of transition’The gloomy outlook for Adidas follows what Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer called a “disappointing year” for the German giant.  “We definitely did not perform as we should have performed,” he said when presenting the company’s results Wednesday.   Its operating profit fell 66% year-over-year to €669 million ($705 million).    While the company’s global sales grew 1% last year, it saw a 36% annual sales decline in China — its biggest single market — due partly to the nation’s now-ditched zero-Covid policy.   Adidas is hoping this year will mark a turning point.   “2023 will be a year of transition to set the base to again be a growing and profitable company,” Chief Executive Officer Bjørn Gulden said in a statement last month.  “I am convinced that over time we will make Adidas shine again. But we need some time.”  — Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.

Russia says it may challenge Biden’s nominee to head the World Bank    			By Reuters  Published  6:17 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackWorld Bank president: We're facing a global recession in 2023    05:42   - Source:CNNRussia is consulting with its allies about challenging the US nominee to head the World Bank, Moscow’s top representative at the organization said Tuesday. The move could complicate what was expected to be a smooth succession process.  Russia remains a voting member of the World Bank, although the bank halted all programs in Russia and Belarus last March, citing what it called “hostilities against the people of Ukraine” following Russia’s invasion.  Roman Marshavin, the World Bank executive director who represents Russia and Syria, told Reuters the “listing of potential candidates and consultations are still ongoing,” but gave no details. He said the decision would be made in Moscow.  US President Joe Biden last month nominated ex-Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, 63, to replace David Malpass at the helm of the World Bank, which oversees billions of dollars in funding for developing countries.  Russia’s plans were first reported by Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency.  It quoted Marshavin as saying he was in discussions with other countries about possible candidates including Russian financiers and foreign economists, former heads of international organizations, as well as several ex-ministers of finance and heads of central banks.  Marshavin declined to comment on the specifics of the TASS report or which other countries were involved.TensionsBanga, who is traveling in Africa this week, said last week that he had already won support from India, Ghana and Kenya. He also received positive reviews from France and Germany at last month’s meeting of Group of 20 finance officials, and on Tuesday won the endorsement of Bangladesh.  The US Treasury declined to comment on the possible Russian challenge.  While the bank will accept nominations from other countries until March 29, Biden’s nomination all but assures that Banga will fill the role.  The World Bank has been headed by someone from the United States, the lender’s dominant shareholder, since its founding at the end of World War Two.  A challenge from Russia or an allied country is unlikely to change the outcome, given the shareholding structure, but it could expose simmering tensions between the United States and Western nations and China — the World Bank’s third-largest shareholder — over the bank and other global financial institutions.

Sign up here for the ‘5 Things’ newsletter.A new report has shed light on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s secret, lavish lifestyle and reputed girlfriend as his invasion of Ukraine rages on. These never-before-seen images inside Putin’s opulent home may also provide a lens into his values and how he views the war, an independent journalist said.  Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.   (You can get “CNN’s 5 Things” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. FloodsAs many parts of California attempt to recover from colossal amounts of snow that trapped mountain communities, more than 16 million people are now under flood watches ahead of a storm set to drench the state Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain. The places that will be impacted – mostly across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento – have already been dealt layers of snow from the previous brutal storms. In response to the ominous forecast, many residents in the region have been urged to prepare at least two weeks of essentials ahead of the likely flooding. The impending atmospheric river event won’t be the first this year to lash California. Late last year and into the new year, multiple rounds of heavy rains from atmospheric rivers soaked entire neighborhoods and unleashed mudslides that killed at least 18 people.2. Mexico kidnappingTwo of the four Americans who authorities say were kidnapped in Mexico last week have been found dead, officials said Tuesday. The other two were found alive. The group of friends traveled from South Carolina so one of them – a mother of six – could undergo a medical procedure across the border, but they never made it to the appointment. The discovery of the Americans’ whereabouts comes days after the four were targeted by a Mexican cartel that likely mistook them for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official said. Their abduction highlights the ongoing violence that has plagued some Mexican cities during the long-running Mexican drug war as well as the growing business of “medical tourism.”3. Covid-19The US is planning to relax Covid-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, a source told CNN. In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijing’s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases. Those restrictions will be relaxed this week, the source said, citing a decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths – and more data surrounding the variants that were circulating in China. The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a program that surveys travelers on details around new variants. 4. MarijuanaVoters in Oklahoma will reject a ballot measure that would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state for adults ages 21 and older, CNN projects. The measure in Tuesday’s special election would have allowed for possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the growth of up to six marijuana plants. If it had passed, there would also have been a 15% tax on sales of recreational marijuana in the state. Supporters of the measure argued it would bring in new tax revenue, but critics said it would negatively impact communities. It was one of several ballot measures on cannabis use that has been considered by voters in recent months. Similar measures in November failed in Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota, while voters in Maryland and Missouri passed measures for recreational cannabis use.5. TikTokA dozen senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Tuesday expanding President Joe Biden’s legal authority to ban TikTok nationwide, marking the latest in a string of congressional proposals threatening the social media platform’s future in the country. The legislation specifically aims to give the government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk. The proposed law takes a wide-ranging approach to fears that companies with ties to China could be pressured by that country’s government into handing over Americans’ data. The legislation has “sparked a lot of interest” from other senators beyond the 12 co-sponsors and among some members of the House in both parties, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said.BREAKFAST BROWSEWhat to know about Holi, the festival of colors  Millions of people in India and around the world are celebrating Holi this week.

TikTok could be a valuable tool for China if it invades Taiwan, FBI director says    			By Sean Lyngaas, CNN		  Published  12:44 PM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad Feedback'I wish I did look like this': See user reactions to viral, new beauty filter    01:15   - Source:CNN BusinessNew YorkCNN      The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the short-form video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday.   Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the panel’s ranking member, on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait.  “The most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something that’s very sacred in our country —the difference between the private sector and public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,” Wray told Rubio in the hearing.   Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate panel, argued that TikTok presents “a substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didn’t face in the past.”  Wray’s comments come a day after Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the US National Security Agency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he worried TikTok could censor videos to shape public opinion in a way that threatens US national security interests.  It’s the latest in a full-court press from US officials to sound the alarm about TikTok’s alleged security risks as Congress weighs giving the Biden administration more authority to address the alleged threat posed by the platform, up to and including banning the app in the United States  TikTok CEO Shou Chew said this week that the Chinese government has “never asked us for US user data” and the company would not provide it if the government did ask. Chew also said that “misinformation and propaganda has no place on our platform, and our users do not expect that.”  The company has taken voluntary steps to wall off US user data from the rest of its global organization, including by hosting that data on servers operated by the US tech giant Oracle. The company is also negotiating a possible agreement with the Biden administration that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under certain conditions.  In a statement this week, a TikTok spokesperson said a US government ban would stifle American speech and would be “a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.”  – CNN’s Brian Fung and Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report.

China censors women modeling lingerie on livestream shopping – so men are doing it    			By Chris Lau and Kathleen Magramo, CNN		  Updated  6:00 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackMen are modeling lingerie in China. Here's why    00:50   - Source:CNN Business    Hong KongCNN      Donning a sassy piece of silk lingerie, a male model grooves to the beat and forms a heart shape with his fingers during a livestreaming session on Douyin, one of China’s most popular video-sharing platforms.   His modeling performance is the latest illustration of the kind of entrepreneurial innovation sometimes needed to bypass China’s rigorous internet censorship, a dragnet that can ensnare seemingly innocuous activities – in this case retailers selling women’s underwear online.  China deploys one of the world’s most stringent censorship regimes, with a track record of blocking out not just politically sensitive information but images of women’s bodies deemed marginally racy.  Several businesses specializing in selling lingerie through livestreaming have had their sessions cut short after they featured a female model and their brush with internet censorship came to light in January.   Hence the use of men instead.   On one of the sales channels, a man is seen dressed in black lingerie, standing next to a mannequin showing a similar outfit, in what appears to be a screenshot of a livestream broadcast on Alibaba    (BABA)’s Taobao Live, a streaming platform for the e-commerce giant.  In another image, a different male model put on a pink slip dress and silky shawl, accessorized with cat ear headbands.

Everyone is being very serious about complying with the rules,” the man, who identified himself as Mr Xu, said.  The emergence of male lingerie models has caused mixed views online in China, from merriment and annoyance to reluctant acceptance.   “So what should I do if I want to promote and showcase lingerie in the live broadcast session? It’s very simple, find a man to wear it,” read one comment on China’s microblogging site Weibo.

As of June last year, the number of livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China is over 460 million, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing’s commerce ministry.  A 2021 report by iResearch, a Beijing-based firm specializing in measuring audience growth online, predicted the livestream sector would be worth as much as $720 billion this year.  Male models are not the only workaround.  On Douyin, the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, other female models have circumvented the censorship by showcasing the latest style of lingerie on themselves on top of a t-shirt they are already wearing.   Others displayed the items on mannequins.

Having male influencers promoting female-oriented products is not new in China, either.   One of the industry’s most successful livestream shopping influencers is Austin Li Jiaqi, who made his name as the “Lipstick King” after selling 15,000 lipsticks in just five minutes in 2018.  As one of China’s biggest internet celebrities, Li also peddles cosmetics, skincare products and fashion apparel, often applying products he’s selling to his own face.  Even outside of China, platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have faced criticism for restricting the sharing of images involving partial nudity, especially of women.  Facebook and Instagram’s parent company, Meta, restricts the sharing of breasts, although it says it intends “to allow images that are shared for medical or health purposes.” But even Meta’s own Oversight Board has called on the company to make its policy less confusing and more gender inclusive.  YouTube says it prohibits “the depiction of clothed or unclothed genitals, breasts, or buttocks that are meant for sexual gratification,” but it may age-restrict other images or videos involving nudity.

IMF chief: Ukraine war will have ‘devastating’ consequences for Russia’s economy    			By Julia Horowitz, CNN		  Updated  7:27 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad Feedback'We don't see global recession': IMF chief on 2023 economic outlook    02:12   - Source:CNN Business    LondonCNN      The International Monetary Fund has drawn criticism for forecasting that Russia will see stronger economic growth this year than either the United Kingdom or Germany, despite rising pressure from Western sanctions.   But Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that the economic outlook for Russia beyond 2023 is “quite devastating.”  “When you take our projections over a medium term, what they mean is Russia[’s economy] shrinking by at least 7%,” Georgieva said in an interview that aired Wednesday.   In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from both the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Economists at those groups have penciled in contractions of 3.3% and 5.6% in 2023, respectively.  Even Russia’s own central bank, which extended emergency capital controls for another six months on Monday, has said gross domestic product might contract by 1% this year.  A man walks past commercial premises put up for rent and sale in Moscow on February 10, 2023. - Real estate analysts say the housing market in Russia has been on a rollercoaster ride since Russians panicked when sanctions over the country's military action in Ukraine hit and then adjusted to their new reality. First, prices spiked as home-owners sought to secure their savings when the penalties hit. Then they dropped as tens of thousands Russians opposed to the conflict and worried for their futures up and left. President Putin insists Russia is weathering the Western sanctions. A home-grown brand has replaced McDonald's and supermarkets are offering Russian-made drinks to replace foreign brands like Coca Cola, which left Russia last year. Still, Russia's economy is facing mounting problems as the West -- one year into the conflict -- is building on its sanctions program with a 10th EU package looming. Hundreds of foreign companies have exited, leaving behind emptying shopping malls, while inflation, which stands at around 12 percent, has undermined the purchasing power of Russian wages. Natalia Koleniskova/AFP/Getty ImagesRussia's economy is hurting despite Putin's blusterJeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor, wrote in Fortune magazine Monday that the “IMF has been asleep at the switch” and parroting propaganda from Russian President Vladimir Putin.  “With respect to Russia, it is naively echoing Putin’s own invented GDP forecasts, in effect, canonizing and legitimating these economic myths with no verification,” said Sonnenfeld and two colleagues, Stephen Roach and Steven Tian.  Sonnenfeld has kept a list of Western companies curtailing operations in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine one year ago and has called for firms to exit the country.  Georgieva told CNN that Russia’s economy would suffer over time as workers emigrated and access to technology was cut off, and as sanctions on its vast energy industry took a toll.  “This year what we reflect on is that Russia has managed to direct some of [its] oil sales beyond the markets of the European Union,” she said, referring to Russia’s success in rerouting crude shipments to China and India. “That is not going to be a lasting impact for the Russian economy.”   “We don’t see Russia in any way benefiting from what they have caused to Ukraine and to themselves.”  Following Europe’s recent import bans on seaborne Russian crude and oil products, Moscow’s finances have shown signs of strain. On Monday, the Russian government reported a budget deficit of 2.58 trillion rubles ($34 billion) for January and February, compared with a surplus of 415 billion ($5.5 billion) rubles in the same period in 2022. It said oil and gas revenues had fallen 46% year-over-year.Inflation fight continuesMeanwhile, the US and European economies have proven surprisingly resilient, Georgieva said. She pointed to the strength of their job markets and Europe’s swift action to limit reliance on Russian energy.  “All of this contributes positively to our prospects for growth,” Georgieva said. “We don’t see [a] global recession in the cards for this year.”  That won’t prevent a global slowdown, however, as central banks continue their campaigns to bring inflation down from the highest levels in decades. The IMF expects world economic output, which grew 3.4% in 2022, to rise 2.9% in 2023.  Yet according to Georgieva, it’s essential policymakers don’t ease up on interest rate hikes prematurely, lest prices soar again.  “Stay the course,” Georgieva advised Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.   The Fed slowed the pace of rate hikes last month, but Powell indicated in testimony to Congress Tuesday that the central bank may need to turn hawkish again.  “The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell said. The Fed “would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes” if necessary, he added.  — Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.

Chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., makes an opening statement during the Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats in Hart Building on Wednesday, March 8, 2023. From left are, FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Gen. Paul Nakasone, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, CIA Director William J.Burns, and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott D.Berrier. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/APCNN      US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to press Taiwan and try to undercut US influence in the coming years as he begins a third term as president.  While Beijing has stepped up its public criticism of the US, Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the intelligence community assesses that China still believes it “benefits most by preventing a spiraling of tensions and by preserving stability in its relationship with the United States.”  Haines and the other top intelligence officials – CIA Director William Burns, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier and NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone – testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday at the panel’s annual public worldwide threats hearing.  Haines ticked through the global challenges the US faces – from China and Russia to Iran and North Korea – along with the risks related to cyber and technology as well as authoritarian governments.   China was among the top concerns for senators at the hearing, where Haines and the other intelligence chiefs were pressed on everything from China’s global ambitions to the risks of TikTok and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China.  Russia’s war in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s long-term intentions were another key issue, as Haines warned that Putin could be digging in for the long haul because the Russian military cannot make territorial gains.Russia probably does not want conflict with US and NATO, intel chiefs sayThe US intelligence community believes that Russia “probably does not want a direct military conflict with US and NATO forces, but there is potential for that to occur,” according to the unclassified annual threat assessment report of the intelligence community issued on Wednesday that US intelligence leaders testified about.   “Russian leaders thus far have avoided taking actions that would broaden the Ukraine conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders, but the risk for escalation remains significant,” the report says.   Haines said in her testimony that the Ukraine conflict has become a “grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage,” but said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to carry on, possibly for years.  “We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favor, and that prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia’s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,” Haines said.  Haines explained that Russia will likely be unable to sustain even its currently modest level of offensive operations in Ukraine without an additional mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources.  “They may fully shift to holding and defending the territories they now occupy,” said Haines  Haines called Putin’s “nuclear saber-rattling” an attempt to “deter the West from providing additional support to Ukraine.”  “He probably will still remain confident that Russia can eventually militarily defeat Ukraine and wants to prevent Western support from tipping the balance and forcing a conflict with NATO,” she said.  Still, as Russia deals with “extensive damage” from its war in Ukraine, Moscow will grow more dependent on its nuclear, cyber and space capabilities, the US intelligence agencies said in their report.  Heavy losses on the battlefield in Ukraine “have degraded Moscow’s ground- and air-based conventional capabilities and increased its reliance on nuclear weapons,” the report added.Senators concerned about China and Tik-Tok, Covid origins investigationSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence panel, argued that TikTok presents “a substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didn’t face in the past.”  The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, Wray told the panel Wednesday.   Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Rubio on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait.  “The most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something that’s very sacred in our country — the difference between the private sector and public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,” Wray said.  Rubio and Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, also pressed the intelligence leaders on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in light of a new Energy Department assessment, made with low confidence, that the pandemic likely was the result of a lab leak in Wuhan.   Haines said the intelligence community is still seeking to collect additional information to determine the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic but reiterated there’s no consensus at this point among US intelligence agencies.  “There’s a broad consensus in the intelligence community that the outbreak is not the result of a bioweapon or genetic engineering. What there isn’t a consensus on is whether or not it’s a lab leak, essentially as Director Wray indicated, or natural exposure to an infected animal,” Haines said.  Collins, a proponent of the lab leak theory, argued that the two theories should not carry the same weight.  “I just don’t understand why you continue to maintain on behalf of the intelligence community that these are two equally plausible explanations. They simply are not,” Collins said.Committee has ‘unfinished business’ on classified documentsSenate Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said that the committee still had “unfinished business” with the investigation into the handling of classified documents, reiterating that the committee still needed to see the documents taken from the offices and homes of President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.   “I think I speak for everyone on both sides of the aisle on this committee, we still have unfinished business regarding the classified documents that we need to see in order for this intelligence committee to effectively oversee its job on intelligence oversights,” said Warner during his opening remarks at the committee’s annual worldwide threats hearing.  Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, asked Haines and Wray why they hadn’t personally looked at all of the classified documents that were found. They responded they had both reviewed some but not all of the documents.   Wray said that he had gone through a “fairly meticulous listing” of all the documents with “detailed information about the contents,” while noting the FBI had teams experienced with mishandling of classified documents cases.   At the end of Wednesday’s public hearing, both Warner and Rubio pressed the intelligence chiefs to give the committee access to the classified documents so they could conduct proper oversight of the intelligence community’s damage assessment on the mishandling of the classified material.  “How can we possibly conduct oversight over whether you’ve assigned the proper risk assessment and over whether the mitigation is appropriate – how can we possibly do that if we don’t know what we’re talking about?” Rubio said. “A special counsel cannot have veto authority over Congress’ ability to do its job. It just can’t happen. It won’t happen. And so it will change the nature of the relationship between this committee.”Intel community says racially motivated extremists are most lethal threatTransnational racially and ethnically motivated extremists, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists,”remain the most lethal threat to US persons and interests,” the intelligence community said in its new report.  The report says this largely “decentralized movement” poses “a significant threat to a number of US allies and partners through attacks and propaganda that espouses violence.”  “These actors increasingly seek to sow social divisions, support fascist-style governments, and attack government institutions. The transnational and loose structure of RMVE organizations challenges local security services and creates a resilience against disruptions,” the report states, referring to racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist groups.   The report also raises concern that a prolonged conflict in Ukraine could provide foreign racially and ethnically motivated extremists “with opportunities to gain access to battlefield experience and weapons.”  Cotton questioned Haines skeptically about the assessment, arguing that deaths from fentanyl were more lethal in the US. Haines responded that while fentanyl caused more deaths, the report was in relation to terrorism threats.   “But in the context of terrorism, your conclusion is that racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists are a more lethal threat to Americans than ISIS or Al Qaeda or Hezbollah?” Cotton asked.  Haines noted that past reports had made the same assessment, as racially and ethnically motivated extremists were similarly listed as the most lethal threat to US persons and interests in the 2022 version of the intelligence community report.  “It simply is a question of how many people, how many US persons are killed or wounded as a consequence of attacks,” Haines said.  “I find this astonishing,” Cotton said at the end of his questioning.  This story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.

Qin, who was until recently China’s ambassador to the US, built up a reputation for being careful and accomplished diplomat while overseas.  But he struck a far more combative tone in his first appearance as foreign minister at China’s annual parliamentary meeting, warning of the “catastrophic consequences” of what he described as a “reckless gamble” by Washington in how it treats its fellow superpower.  “If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” Qin said on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress in Beijing.  At the highly scripted event, Qin set the tone for China’s foreign policy for the coming year and beyond, berating the US for rising bilateral tensions and defending Beijing’s close partnership with Moscow.  Ties between the world’s two largest economies are at their worst in decades, and tensions soared further last month after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated over North America and was then shot down by US fighter jets.  On Tuesday, Qin accused the US of overreacting in its response, which he said created “a diplomatic crisis that could have been avoided.”  The incident, Qin said, shows “the US perception and views of China are seriously distorted. It regards China as its primary rival and the biggest geopolitical challenge.”  “The US claims it seeks to compete with China but does not seek conflict. But in reality, the so-called ‘competition’ by the US is all-round containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death,” he said.   “Containment and suppression will not make America great, and the US will not stop the rejuvenation of China,” Qin said.Colliding powers The great power rivalry between the US and China has intensified in recent years.  Under leader Xi Jinping, China has become increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive abroad, taking a more aggressive approach to exert its influence and counter the West.   And Washington has pushed back.  Under the Biden administration, the US has shored up ties with allies and partners to contain Beijing’s rising influence, including in its backyard.   It has also pushed to decouple from China in emerging technologies, recently banning the export of advanced chips to the fury of Beijing.  Qin lashed out at Washington for its Indo-Pacific strategy, accusing it of forming exclusive blocks to provoke confrontation, advocating for decoupling and plotting an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO.”  “The real purpose of the Indo-Pacific strategy is to contain China,” Qin said. “No Cold War should be repeated in Asia, and no Ukraine-style crisis should be repeated in Asia.”  China’s refusal to condemn Russia for the invasion of Ukraine and its growing partnership with Moscow have further strained its relations with the West. While Beijing has sought to cast itself as a neutral peace broker, it has also defended its “rock-solid” ties with Russia.  On Tuesday Qin said the Sino-Russian relationship “does not pose a threat to any country in the world, nor will it be interfered or sowed discord in by any third party.”  “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations,” he said.  Qin highlighted the issue of Taiwan as the “bedrock of the political foundation of Sino-US relations and the first red line that must not be crossed.”   The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and refuses to rule out the use of force to “reunify” it with mainland China.  On Tuesday, Qin urged the US not to “interfere in China’s internal affairs” and questioned Washington’s different responses to the issues of Ukraine and Taiwan.  “Why does the US talk up respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Ukraine issue, but does not respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on the issue of Taiwan? Why does the US ask China not to provide weapons to Russia while keeps selling arms to Taiwan?” Qin said.McCarthy visit?Qin’s remarks come amid reports of a potential meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April.  The Financial Times reported Monday that Tsai could meet McCarthy in California, rather than in Taiwan as the US Speaker had initially indicated.   A US State Department spokesperson said Monday he was “not aware of any confirmed travel” by the Taiwanese President, and Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it had no information to share regarding any potential US visit.  However, regardless of the location, a face to face between Tsai and a senior US politician will most certainly draw the ire of Beijing, fueling even more tensions in already tense relations across the Taiwan Strait – and between US and China.  Defying Beijing’s threats of retaliation, McCarthy’s Democratic predecessor Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August in the first trip by a US Speaker in 25 years.   Beijing responded by staging unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan and cutting off key lines of communication with the US.   China’s Foreign Ministry has since warned McCarthy not to visit Taiwan.  Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Program, said Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy in California is not necessarily a “replacement or downgrade.”   Instead, it could be an “add-on,” he said, suggesting McCarthy could always visit Taiwan at a later date.  While Taiwan wants to normalize high-level visits by American officials to Taiwan, it also needs to be seen by its Western partners that it is being a responsible stakeholder in the process.  “Some may think that there is better timing than this current moment to be pursing another US speaker visit to Taiwan,” Sung said.  A meeting in the US, he added, could serve as “a very visual deliverable in the short term to show continued US support for Taiwan, regardless of change of party leadership in the legislature.”   Tsai has transited in the US before on her visits to Taipei’s diplomatic allies.  She last visited the US in 2019 and gave a speech in New York – a trip that angered Beijing.  To China, Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy will be provocative no matter where it takes place, Sung said.  “Beijing is going to be very unhappy and protest vigorously regardless. So I guess for them it will be a difference in intensity, but not a difference in kind. Beijing won’t like any such high level exchange be it taking place on Taiwan or US soil.”    CNN’s Eric Cheung in Taipei contributed to reporting.

It will also expand its defense budget 7.2%, marking a slight increase over growth the previous year.  Both figures for the coming year were released at the opening of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, which draws nearly 3,000 delegates to Beijing for the next eight days.  “China’s economy is staging a steady recovery and demonstrating vast potential and momentum for further growth,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang told delegates while delivering a government work report at the opening of the congress on Sunday.  The economy added more than 12 million urban jobs last year, with the urban unemployment rate falling to 5.5%, according to the work report, which emphasized China’s focus on ensuring stable growth, employment and prices amid global inflation and set the GDP target.  China also unveiled its annual military budget for 2023, which will increase 7.2% to roughly 1.55 trillion yuan ($224 billion) in a draft budget report released Sunday morning.  The spending increase marks the second year in a row that the annual hike in military spending has exceeded 7% and tops last year’s 7.1% growth, amid rising geopolitical tensions and a regional arms race. As with other recent years, the figure stays well below the symbolically significant double-digit expansion.   “The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board, develop new military strategic guidance, devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and make well-coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains,” Li’s work report said.  The GDP target and military spending are among the most closely watched in the opening day proceedings, with the GDP target figure in particular being monitored this year as China emerges from its economically draining zero-Covid policy. The new figure appears modest against what some analysts had predicted could be a more robust aim for the year ahead.   The NPC meeting is a key yearly political event that occurs alongside a gathering of China’s top political advisory body, with the events together known as the Two Sessions.   This is the first Two Sessions since Chinese leader Xi Jinping secured a norm-breaking third term atop the Chinese Communist Party hierarchy in October. Xi is set to enter his third term as President, a largely ceremonial title, during the congress.

It was the second lowest annual growth rate since 1976, behind only 2020 – when the initial Covid outbreaks nearly paralyzed the economy. In December, after the Communist Party abruptly ended its zero-Covid policy, a massive wave of infections swept across the country, throwing supply chains and factories into chaos. But the disruptions started to fade away in January, and the economic recovery picked up pace last month.  Official data released Wednesday showed China’s factories had their best month in nearly 11 years in February, underscoring how quickly economic activity has bounced back following the end of the Covid exit wave. The services and construction industries also had their best performance in two years.

Analysts had predicted a difficult track to recovery for China amid global headwinds, which may have also been reflected in the conservative 2023 target of “around 5%” announced Sunday.  The global economy will weaken further this year as rising interest rates and Russia’s war in Ukraine continue to weigh on activity, the International Monetary Fund estimated in January. Global growth will likely slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023.  China is set to release its import and export data for the first two months of this year on Tuesday, which will provide a glimpse into demand for global trade.

Premier Li’s replacement will be formally appointed during the meeting, which runs until March 13.  The new economic team will face the tough task of reviving the Chinese economy as it navigates a growing array of challenges, including sluggish consumption, rising unemployment, a historic downturn in real estate, and increasing tension with the United States over technology sanctions.Military spendingThe 7.2% increase in planned defense spending marks the first time in the past decade that the budget growth rate has increased for three consecutive years, as Beijing continues to modernize and build-up its military, while asserting pressure on Taiwan – the self-governing island democracy the Chinese Communist Party claims as its own despite never having ruled.  China now controls the world’s largest navy by size and continues to advance its fleet of nuclear submarines and stealth fighter jets.   The military budget expanded 7.1% to 1.45 trillion yuan in 2022, compared with 6.8% the previous year. The last year China’s annual defense spending grew by double digits was 2015. The size of this year’s budget is more than double that of ten years ago.  Chinese officials have repeatedly sought to portray their military spending as reasonable relative to other countries like the United States – part of China’s bid to present itself as a peaceful power, despite its aggression in the region including its militarization of the South China Sea and heavy patrolling around Taiwan.   During a press conference Saturday ahead of the opening day, NPC spokesperson Wang Chao said China’s defense budget maintained a “relatively moderate and reasonable growth rate.”  “China’s defense expenditure as a percentage of GDP has remained stable over the years. It remains basically stable, lower than the world average,” Wang said.    CNN’s Mengchen Zhang in Beijing contributed reporting.

A healthcare worker labels a Covid-19 test from an international traveler at a CDC Covid-19 variant testing site inside Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California, US, on Jan. 9, 2023. An official told CNN that the US could relax Covid testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday. Jill Connelly/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILECNN      The US is planning to relax Covid-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, a source familiar told CNN Tuesday, citing a decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and more data surrounding the variants that were circulating in China.  In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijing’s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases.  The source said the order was put in place in an effort to protect US citizens following “a large wave of infections in the PRC,” coupled with “a lack of transparency” by Chinese officials surrounding the surge.  The Washington Post was first to report news of the relaxed travel restrictions.   The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) program that surveys travelers on details around new variants.   The testing requirement instated in January came after China dismantled its controversial and long-held zero-Covid policy in early December, catching many in the country by surprise.  US officials expressed concern at the time over the risk of a new variant emerging  in China while they had limited insight into the increase in infections.   Tuesday’s announcement also comes after a US Department of Energy assessment that the virus likely emerged from a laboratory accident in China placed further strain on relations between the US and China.  The department’s “low confidence” determination – a minority view among the US intelligence agencies – prompted the Chinese Foreign Ministry to call for the US “to respect science and facts, stop politicizing this issue, stop its intelligence-led, politics-driven origins-tracing.”  China has fiercely denied that the virus emerged from a lab accident but has complicated outside efforts to understand how the pandemic originated.   This story has been updated with additional information.   CNN’s Simone McCarthy, Arlette Saenz, Kevin Liptak and Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.

They (China) have had in just the last three months a military or some type of confrontation with every country. And then they’re shocked that countries are taking their own steps for deterrence to protect themselves. What did they think they were going to do?” Ambassador Rahm Emanuel said in the interview at his residence in Tokyo.  The US envoy listed a string of what he said were aggressive military actions by China, including “attacks” against India along their shared Himalayan border, Chinese coast guard ships aiming lasers at Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, the firing of missiles into Japan’s exclusive economic zone and the harassment of US, Canadian and Australian aircraft by People’s Liberation Army ships and planes.  Beijing has denied being an aggressor in all those instances and accused Washington of being the primary instigator of heightened tensions in the region.  On Tuesday, China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that “conflict and confrontation” with the US is inevitable if Washington does not change course.  “The US claims it seeks to compete with China but does not seek conflict. But in reality, the so-called ‘competition’ by the US is all-round containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death,” he said during his first news conference in the new post.  “Containment and suppression will not make America great, and the US will not stop the rejuvenation of China,” Qin said.Japan and South KoreaEmanuel countered on Wednesday that military buildups and exercises by the US and its partners in the Indo-Pacific are not acts of containment, as Beijing charges, but acts of deterrence against further – and possibly more dangerous – Chinese aggression.  “They’ve come together to realize that (Chinese aggression) can’t continue as is, so every country is taking steps, both within an alliance (and) also within their own self-interest of creating a comprehensive coalition of deterrence. That’s what’s going on,” Emanuel said.  He praised Japan for doubling its defense budget and taking on a leadership role in the region, citing plans for it to operate joint South China Sea patrols with the Philippines and its agreement with South Korea just this week to settle grievances dating back to before World War II concerning Japan’s colonial rule in Korea.  And he praised both Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for putting the future before history and taking a stance that has prompted domestic backlash in both Tokyo and Seoul.  “I do think that both leaders showed a braveness and a boldness to look to the 21st century and make the most of that rather than being tied by 20th century,” Emanuel said.  “To me the test of leadership is to be idealistic enough to know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And then tough enough to get it done,” he said, adding that both Kishida and Yoon had passed that test.‘Gravitational pull of freedom’The US ambassador also contrasted the countries Japan has been partnering with, including South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, India and even the United Kingdom, with countries with whom China works, including Russia, North Korea and Iran.  “There’s a phrase in America, you’re known by the company you keep,” Emanuel said.  Over the past 18 months, the Biden administration has been keeping good company, too, he said, noting its record in uniting allies and partners.  Emanuel cited multilateral agreements like the Quad – the informal alliance of the US, Japan, Australia and India – and the AUKUS deal for nuclear-powered submarines between the US, Australia and the UK as well as other economic, diplomatic and military initiatives.  “I think that has given our allies confidence, like Japan, to increase the defense budget, to be more active on the diplomatic arena and stage,” he said, giving credit to Tokyo for getting eight of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to vote to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a March 3 United Nations General Assembly vote.  Countries around the world will respond to Japan, or South Korea, or the US for a simple reason that China doesn’t understand, “the gravitational pull of freedom,” Emanuel said.  “A rules-based system that upholds respect both for the individual and in trying to uphold freedom has its own, I don’t know how else to say it, but seductive gravitational pull.”    CNN’s Nectar Gan, Emiko Jozuka and Alex Stambaugh contributed to this report.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under fire from opposition parties to immediately call a wide-ranging public inquiry into allegations of election interference. Sean Kilpatrick/APOttawaCNN      Amid recent allegations that China attempted to meddle in Canada’s 2019 and 2021 elections, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would appoint an independent investigator or rapporteur to help identify and combat foreign interference in Canada’s elections and its democracy.  “We have long known, and an independent report confirmed it again last week, that the Chinese government and other regimes like Iran and Russia have attempted to interfere not just in our democracy but in our country in general, whether it’s our institutions, our businesses, our research facilities or in the daily lives of our citizens,” said Trudeau Monday during a press conference in Ottawa.  Trudeau added that he was taking new investigative steps to safeguard democracy saying foreign actors were looking to foster instability in Canada. But he underscored that multiple reports have so far determined that despite foreign influence attempts, the results of the 2019 federal election and the 2021 election were not impacted.  Trudeau, who is under fire from opposition parties to immediately call a wide-ranging public inquiry into the issue, said that decision would be up to the rapporteur.    “We will ask the independent special rapporteur as one of the first tasks of their mandate to provide the government with a recommendation as to what the appropriate next step should be whether it be an inquiry and investigation or a judicial review and what the scope of that work may be and we will abide by their recommendation,” he said.  China has reacted angrily to allegations of interference in Canadian elections in recent days calling the accusations “total nonsense.”  “It must be pointed out that only those well-versed in spying can fabricate the outrageous lies as reported in the media,” read a statement, in part, from China’s embassy spokesperson in Ottawa. “Only those accustomed to interfering in other countries’ internal affairs are prone to suspicion and preoccupied with playing the trick of feigning innocence and calling others a thief.”  Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on Thursday also denied the allegations, saying during a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly during a G20 meeting, “China never interferes with other countries’ internal politics, and opposes any country interfering other countries’ internal politics.” Calls for public inquiryCanada’s opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, said only a full public inquiry will “get to the bottom” of what actually happened with regards to foreign interference.  “Justin Trudeau has known about this interference for a decade because it was ten years ago that the Trudeau foundation got its $200,000 (Canadian dollar) donation from a Beijing backed donor and ever since we know that the government in Beijing has been trying to influence and support Justin Trudeau,” said Poilievre during a press conference Monday.  Poilievre was referring to a Globe and Mail newspaper report that a foundation named after Trudeau’s father, Pierre, a former prime minister of Canada, had received a $200,000 (Canadian dollar) donation in 2016 from two wealthy Chinese businessmen to fund scholarships and leadership programs.  Poilievre claims those connections go back to 2013 when the younger Trudeau first entered politics.  A spokesperson for Trudeau’s office said that the prime minister withdrew his involvement in any affairs of his father’s namesake foundation when he entered federal politics nearly a decade ago.  In a statement last week, the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation said it would refund the donation in light of recent media reports, and in keeping with its role as an independent, non-partisan charity. The foundation said it would not accept any donation that “may have been sponsored by a foreign government,” according to the statement.  In a government report released last week, Morris Rosenberg, a former public servant charged with looking into attempts to influence Canada’s 2021 election, concluded that foreign actors attempted to meddle but that they did not influence the outcome of the elections.  Rosenberg himself was the CEO of the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation in 2016 when the Chinese businessmen made the donation.

US senators unveil bipartisan bill empowering Biden to ban TikTok and other services    			By Brian Fung, CNN		  Updated  3:45 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackCybersecurity expert talks TikTok concerns    06:13   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      A dozen US senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Tuesday expanding President Joe Biden’s legal authority to ban TikTok nationwide, marking the latest in a string of congressional proposals threatening the social media platform’s future in the United States.  The legislation, called the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act, does not target TikTok specifically for a ban. But it aims to give the US government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk.  Adobe StockHouse panel votes to advance bill empowering Biden to ban TikTokThe proposed law takes a wide-ranging approach to fears that companies with ties to China could be pressured by that country’s government into handing over Americans’ sensitive personal information or communications records. In the case of TikTok, lawmakers have said China’s national security laws could force TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to provide access to TikTok’s US user data.   TikTok CEO Shou Chew said this week the company has never received such a request from the Chinese government and would never comply with one. The company has taken voluntary steps to wall off US user data from the rest of its global organization, including by hosting that data on servers operated by the US tech giant Oracle. The company is also negotiating a possible agreement with the Biden administration that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under certain conditions.   In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said a US government ban would stifle American speech and would be “a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.”  But that has not stopped many policymakers from seeking tougher measures against the company.   Last week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced a bill that would require the Biden administration to issue a nationwide TikTok ban if an assessment of the platform found potential risks to US user data — risks that multiple administration officials have already said exist.   Another bill led by Sen. Marco Rubio would ban transactions by social media companies based in or under the “substantial influence” of countries considered US foreign adversaries.  Tuesday’s bill, unveiled by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner and South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune, is less prescriptive — granting the Commerce Department wide discretion to identify, and then to mitigate, perceived risks stemming from technology produced by companies with ties to foreign adversaries including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela.   The bill specifically directs the Secretary of Commerce to “identify, deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise mitigate” national security risks associated with technology linked to those countries. It enables the Commerce Secretary to negotiate, enter into, impose and enforce “any mitigation measure” in response.   That latitude would reflect an entirely new authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce, not authority derived from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.   The legislation would cover a broad range of technologies in addition to social media, Warner said, including artificial intelligence, financial technology services, quantum computing and e-commerce. The bill’s text also prioritizes technology in satellite and mobile networks, cloud services and storage, internet infrastructure providers, home internet gear, commercial and personal drones, video games and payment apps, among others.   Under the bill, the US government would also be required to declassify and share evidence gathered by the intelligence community to substantiate allegations that a given company or product poses a national security risk.  The bill would shift US policy away from an ad hoc scramble focused on individual companies, and provide the US government with a systematic legal structure for addressing tech-driven spying threats, Warner said.   In recent years, US concerns about Chinese espionage have largely focused on telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE, who produce wireless gear for cellular networks. But those have expanded to include makers of surveillance cameras and, more recently, apps and software makers such as TikTok.  “Instead of playing whack-a-mole on Huawei one day, ZTE the next, Kasperky, TikTok — we need a more comprehensive approach to evaluating and mitigating these threats posed by these foreign technologies from these adversarial nations,” said Warner, adding that the bill was crafted in consultation with the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Justice and Treasury, along with US intelligence officials, the Federal Communications Commission and the White House.  In a statement, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan endorsed the bill, calling it “a systematic framework for addressing technology-based threats to the security and safety of Americans.”  “This will help us address the threats we face today, and also prevent such risks from arising in the future,” Sullivan said.  Warner added that the legislation has “sparked a lot of interest” from other senators beyond the 12 co-sponsors and among some members of the House in both parties.

China shakes up government to counter financial risks and US tech restrictions    			Analysis by Laura He, CNN		  Published  3:40 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackHow worrisome are U.S. China relations?    03:31   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      China has announced a major government overhaul that will shakeup the oversight of its financial system and aims to boost its technological self-reliance, as a tech war with the United States intensifies.  The change to the State Council, the country’s cabinet, is the biggest in years and the third since Chinese leader Xi Jinping took power in 2013. The plan will further strengthen Xi’s personal control over government institutions and allow him to install more trusted men in key posts.   A tighter grip over key departments is perceived to be helpful in aligning them with Xi’s priorities, which range from maintaining social and economic stability to managing rising geopolitical tension with the United States.  “These proposed institutional changes reflect key focus areas of Chinese policymakers in the next few years, namely improving financial regulation coordination to enhance financial stability,” Goldman Sachs analysts said on Wednesday.  The State Council, the government’s top executive body, oversees 26 ministries and dozens of ministry-level administrative bodies. While major decisions are ultimately made by the Communist Party’s Politburo, the State Council exercises a certain amount of power to implement those policies, especially in economic areas.   Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, takes part in a deliberation with his fellow deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu Province, at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress NPC in Beijing, capital of China, March 5, 2023. Li Xueren/Xinhua/Getty ImagesXi Jinping hits out at US as he urges China's private firms to 'fight' alongside Communist PartyBeijing also plans to downsize the so-called “iron rice bowl,” a popular term for jobs with guaranteed security. The number of civil servant positions in the central government will be cut by 5% over the next five years.   Among the changes announced Tuesday during the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, Beijing will set up a new powerful financial regulator: the National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA).    It will replace the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) supervising commercial banks and insurance companies.   It will directly manage the country’s major financial holding companies, including fintech giant Ant Group, a task that previously belonged to the People’s Bank of China. It will also be responsible for financial consumer protection and investor protection.   Some analysts said Beijing’s apparent move to reassert state control of the economy could frighten investors, said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank.  “Sentiment may worsen as investors should remain cautious on any tasks of regulation tightening given the experiences in the tech sector, housing markets and private tuition industry,” he said. “It appears that the battles of regulation tightening are not yet over.”  Deputies to the National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People  in Beijing on March 7, 2023. VCG/Getty Images    A super regulatorChina’s financial system has traditionally been jointly overseen by the People’s Bank of China, the CBIRC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).  Now, the new NFRA will supervise all financial sectors except the securities industry, which will remain under the CSRC.   The new regulator is meant to “better manage risks” in the financial system and strengthen the supervision of “institutions, behaviors, and functions,” the government proposal said. Supervision will be “penetrating,” it added.  “Establishing a super regulator will help enhance and broaden the regulation in financing and banking industries, which have becoming more complex and interlinking other industries,” said Cheung.  Depositors protest in front of the Henan branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, demanding their money back after their funds were frozen. From Lan Nuo Nuo in FebruarySmall banks in China are running into trouble. Savers could lose everythingThe move comes as risks to the stability of China’s financial system are rising amid a housing market slump and economic slowdown.   The property sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of total bank loans, is in the midst of its worst downturn on record.   Financial stress has already emerged in multiple areas, from last summer’s protests at rural banks in Henan to widespread mortgage boycotts and growing defaults by property developers.   As part of the overhaul, the CSRC will be upgraded from a “public institution” to a “government institution.” On top of its existing responsibilities, it will be given a new one for reviewing and approving corporate bond issuance, which currently falls under the National Development and Reform Commission.  This move demonstrates Beijing’s “increased focus on developing the equity market and pushing forward more direct financing to better allocate capital and help slow the buildup in debt,” Goldman Sachs said.Achieving tech self-relianceThe proposal includes multiple efforts to boost China’s technology and innovation as it tries to counter growing restrictions from the United States on selling advanced technology to China.   The existing Ministry of Science and Technology will be restructured and enhanced. It will be tasked with advancing the “whole nation system” for innovation, with a greater focus on basic research and applying technology to existing industries.  “Facing the grim situation of the international tech race and external containment and suppression, [we must] … better coordinate scientific and technological forces to overcome difficulties in key core technologies, and quickly achieve self-reliance in advanced technologies,” the proposal said.  On Monday, Xi hit out at the United States, while calling on China’s private companies to flight alongside the Communist Party and boost growth and tech innovation.    China will also establish a new department to oversee its vast troves of data. The National Data Bureau will be tasked with drafting data-related regulations and coordinating the sharing and utilization of data.  “Data … is set to be increasingly important going forward,” Citi analysts said. “Its use will be put under [a] more structured regulation going forward.”  The previous regulatory onslaught on Big Tech might be over, but regulation of the industry will be more “normalized,” they said.   Beijing launched a sweeping regulatory crackdown against the country’s internet industry from late 2020 to 2022, which was aimed at bringing powerful tech companies in line with its priorities. The Communist Party made clear before the start of the crackdown that it needs “politically sensible people” in the private sector, who will “firmly listen to the party and follow the party.”  — CNN’s Wayne Chang contributed to this report.

Winter snowBack-to-back winter storms over the past week have overwhelmed several mountain communities in California, leaving residents trapped behind walls of snow and concerned about their dwindling supplies. The Sierra Nevadas could see up to three inches of snow through today, following a weekend that brought as much as 38 inches of snow over a 24-hour period to some areas. In recent days, the snowfall prompted Yosemite National Park to close indefinitely and has buried cars under snow piles that sometimes towered as high as second-story windows. Meanwhile, the Climate Prediction Center is calling for below-average temperatures for much of the rest of the country this week which could bring snow as far south as the southern Appalachians as well as into the mid-Atlantic region.2. January 6Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired newly released footage on his show Monday from the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack that included images of the rioter known as the “QAnon Shaman,” as well as of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died following the attack. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy granted Carlson access to more than 40,000 hours of the Capitol security footage from January 6. CNN and other news organizations have also requested access to the footage. McCarthy’s office said it is still working out the process to make the footage “more widely available” but did not comment further. Separately, former Vice President Mike Pence has asked a judge to block a subpoena for his testimony related to January 6, previously arguing it was “unconstitutional and unprecedented.”  Video Ad FeedbackSource: Mike Pence asks a judge to block a subpoena for his testimony about January 6    02:17   - Source:CNN    3. ChinaGood relations between Beijing and Moscow are essential, China’s foreign minister said today, alarming some US officials. “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations,” Qin Gang said. This comes amid warnings from US officials that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia for its war against Ukraine, which Beijing has denied. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week also cautioned that arming Moscow’s forces would cause China serious problems around the world. Still, Beijing is refusing to acknowledge the nature of the conflict – it has so far avoided calling it an “invasion” – and its diplomatic and economic support for Moscow appears to be increasing.

ImmigrationThe Biden administration is considering reviving the policy of detaining migrant families who cross the border illegally. President Joe Biden had ended the practice when he came into office, but it’s now one of several options administration officials are mulling as they prepare for the end of Title 42 in May – likely resulting in a surge of crossings at the southern border. A source familiar with the deliberations said that family detentions could be limited to a small number of days – an attempt to set the policy apart from the previous administration’s handling of family detentions. Biden, however, has increasingly turned to tougher border enforcement measures in recent months, drawing criticism from immigrant advocates and progressive Democrats who view the changes as a return to some of the policies under former President Donald Trump.5. TwitterTwitter was hit Monday with one of the biggest outages to date under new owner Elon Musk. Some users who attempted to load Twitter were met with an error message or encountered slow-loading pages. In a tweet on Monday, Musk said: “This platform is so brittle (sigh). Will be fixed shortly.” Within about an hour, the issues appeared to have largely been resolved. However, the outage marked the second Twitter glitch in less than a week and the third in under a month. Analysts have noted the company has experienced a range of technical glitches since Musk took over the company and laid off more than half its staff late last year.

She’s had an impressive 200 careers on her resume — doctor, astronaut, computer engineer, CEO and even presidential candidate.   For International Women’s Day on March 8, Mattel (which owns the Barbie brand) is hoping to inspire young girls to embrace the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by honoring a select group of STEM pioneers with their own Barbie doll.  Among them are the Wojcicki sisters — Susan (longtime CEO of YouTube), Anne (CEO of at-home DNA testing company 23andME) and Janet (professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco).  Susan Wojcicki announced in February that was “stepping back” from her leadership role at YouTube after nearly a decade of running the video-sharing platform.  Wojcicki has been involved with YouTube’s parent company Google from its earliest days, when its two founders worked out of her garage in California to build a search engine. She later became Google’s 16th employee and has worked at the company for nearly 25 years.   Barbie is honoring women leaders in STEM for International Women's Day this year with one-of a-kind dolls made in the likeness of trailblazers such as the Wojcicki sisters.MattelThe group also includes women STEM trailblazers from around the world such as Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a space scientist and educator from the United Kingdon;  Antje Boetius, a marine researcher and microbiologist from Germany; Li Yinuo, co-founder of ETU Education, a school startup in China that offers a more personalized education; and Katya Echazarreta, an electrical engineer who has worked on five NASA missions and the first woman born in Mexico to travel to space.  “Our parents fostered independence and a belief that we could truly be anything we wanted to be when I grew up, but most important was to pursue a passion,” Anne Wojcicki said in a statement. “I hope that sharing our stories encourages young girls to try something new, face something that may scare them, and look at challenges as exciting opportunities.”   Mattel said these one-of-a-kind dolls are not for sale and will be gifted to the women who inspired them.  From left to right, clockwise: Susan Wojcicki, Sheryl Sandberg, Meg Whitman, Marissa Mayer.Elijah Nouvelage/Eric Gaillard/Reuters/David Paul Morris/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA generation of high-profile women tech leaders have stepped aside. What's next?  According to Mattel, Barbie herself has held more than 40 different STEM careers, including astrophysicist, space scientist, doctor and robotics engineer. While women in the real world make up half of the US workforce, they still only make up less than one-third of the STEM workforce.  “STEM is a field where women are severely underrepresented, and our hope is that honoring these seven leaders in science and technology will encourage girls to follow their passion in this field,” Lisa McKnight, executive vice president and global head of Barbie & Dolls with Mattel, said in a statement.  The Barbie STEM role models are the latest in an effort by Mattel to champion the achievements of women leaders across professions. For example, the company honored television producer and writer Shonda Rhimes with her own Barbie doll last year and style icon Iris Apfel in 2018.  Mattel’s push to expand into Barbies based on real-life extraordinary women has helped boost the Barbie collector market, said Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of Toys, Tots, Pets & More, an industry review website.  “The Barbie collector market has been strong for many years but Mattel has pivoted to featuring many more role models,” said Silver. “The shift has been extremely popular with their collector fans and also has garnered widespread attention for those role models who should be honored and often don’t get the recognition they deserve.”  Renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall also got her own Barbie in 2022 as part of the Inspiring Women Series of Barbie dolls that are based on  women who have been prominent figures in history. The Jane Goodall Barbie was for sale. The Inspiring Women Barbie series, priced at $35 for the doll, are typically sold at Amazon, Walmart and Target stores.  –CNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this story.

Sri Lanka expects approval of $2.9 billion IMF deal after China support    Reuters  Updated  5:33 AM EST, Tue March 7, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackChina has a new foreign minister. This is his warning to the US    02:36   - Source:CNNColomboReuters      Sri Lanka expects final approval from the International Monetary Fund for a $2.9 billion loan in the third or fourth week of this month, the president said on Tuesday, adding that new support from China means all funding requirements had been met.  The country of 22 million people is struggling with its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.  President Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament there were signs the economy was improving but there was still insufficient foreign currency for all imports, making the IMF deal crucial so other creditors could also start releasing funds.  “Sri Lanka has completed all prior actions that were required by the IMF,” Wickremesinghe said.  He said the Export-Import Bank of China had sent “a new letter” on Monday, and he and the central bank governor had sent a letter of intent to the IMF.  GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - NOVEMBER 01: Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa presents his national statement during day two of COP26 at SECC on November 1, 2021 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. 2021 sees the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference. The conference will run from 31 October for two weeks, finishing on 12 November. It was meant to take place in 2020 but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. (Photo by Andy Buchanan - Pool/Getty Images)Andy Buchanan/Getty ImagesFormer Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa requests to travel to Thailand “As a result of this step and financing assurances from India and the Paris Club, we expect approval for the program either in the third or fourth week of March,” he said.  The country’s international debt and currency roared higher on the news, with bonds adding nearly 3 cents on the dollar while the rupee jumped nearly 8% to a 10-month high.  It was not clear what new support China, the world’s biggest sovereign creditor, extended to Sri Lanka on Monday.   In January, the Export-Import Bank of China offered Sri Lanka a two-year moratorium on its debt and said it would support its efforts to secure the IMF loan, which a Sri Lankan source said at the time was not enough to meet IMF conditions.  China and India are Sri Lanka’s biggest lenders. By end-2020, Sri Lanka owed the Export-Import Bank of China $2.83 billion or 3.5% of the island’s external debt, according to IMF data.‘A lot of positivity’In total, Sri Lanka owed Chinese lenders $7.4 billion, or nearly a fifth of public external debt, by end-2022, calculations by the China Africa Research Initiative showed.  Sri Lanka’s rupee hit a mid-rate of 325 on Tuesday, appreciating 12%, analysts said, against the central bank-set spot rate of 337.67. The appreciation was driven by better dollar inflows from tourism and remittances, positive sentiment over imminent approval of an IMF deal and a downturn in imports, analysts said.  China's research and survey vessel, the Yuan Wang 5, arrives at Hambantota port on August 16, 2022.Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesChinese research ship Yuan Wang 5 docks at Sri Lanka's Hambantota port“There is a lot of positivity around a possible IMF announcement and more dollar loans are expected with an approval of the bailout,” said Udeeshan Jonas, chief strategist at equity research firm CAL Research.  “Also, speculators who were hoarding dollars have started to panic and convert with the rupee starting to appreciate.”  Sri Lanka needs to repay about $6 billion on average each year until 2029 and will have to keep engaging with the IMF, Wickremesinghe said.  Countries in debt distress such as Zambia and Sri Lanka have faced unprecedented delays in securing IMF bailouts as China and Western economies have clashed over how to provide debt relief. Sri Lanka has been waiting for about 187 days to finalize a bailout after reaching a staff-level deal with the IMF.  This compares to a median of 55 days it took low- and middle-income countries over the past decade to go from preliminary deal to board sign-off, according to public data from more than 80 cases compiled by Reuters.  Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday that his country would continue to participate in the settlement of international debt problems in a constructive manner.  Responding to a question on the sidelines of an annual parliament meeting in Beijing, Qin also said that China should be the last to be accused of causing debt traps in other countries and called on other parties to share the burden.

Park rangers show the tiger carcasses in Thong Pha Phum National Park, Kanchanaburi province, west of the capital Bangkok.Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation/DNPBangkok, ThailandCNN      A court in western Thailand on Monday sentenced five poachers to prison terms of five years each for killing a female tiger and her cub in a national park last year.  The provincial court ruled the five men broke conservation laws by killing the protected animals in Thong Pha Phum National Park, Kanchanaburi province, before skinning their carcasses and smoking their bones to prepare them for sale on the illicit market.  Park rangers made the discovery in January last year and seized the tiger parts. Images distributed by officials and taken in the jungle showed the skins of two flayed tigers. Bones and carcass parts were also seen in pictures taken nearby.  The court rejected the men’s argument that they had killed the tigers in revenge for attacks on livestock, ruling they “should have felt protective of nature” given that they lived in a community near the forest.  Tigers are an endangered species with only about 4,500 remaining in the wild, according to the the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Though their numbers have increased in recent years, WWF says fewer than 200 of the big cats remain in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries across Thailand.  Poaching, one of the biggest threats to tigers’ survival, is driven largely by demand in China and Vietnam for their bones, skins and other body parts used in traditional medicine.  The safety and effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine is still heavily debated in China, where it has both adherents and skeptics.   Though many of the remedies in TCM have been in use for hundreds of years, critics argue that there is often little verifiable scientific evidence or peer reviewed studies to support their supposed benefits.  Thong Pha Phum National Park Chief Charoen Jaichon welcomed the court ruling.   “I’m happy that justice has been delivered,” he told CNN on Tuesday. “This is a strong warning to any illegal hunters in Thailand’s national parks.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Firefighters work to put out a blaze at the Brahmapuram plant landfill in Kochi, India.ReutersCNN      Firefighters in the southern Indian city of Kochi were toiling Tuesday to control toxic fumes from spreading after a landfill burst into flames five days ago, cloaking the area in a thick haze and choking residents.   The towering Brahmapuram landfill in Kerala state is the country’s latest trash mountain to catch fire, causing dangerous heat and methane emissions, and adding to India’s growing climate challenges.   video    She lives near a landfill. Now she has to bathe in salt waterAuthorities advised residents in the city of more than 600,000 to remain indoors or wear N95 face masks if they head outside. Schools were forced to close on Monday as a result of the pollution, officials said.   The blaze broke out last Thursday, according to Kerala’s fire department. The cause has not been established, but landfill fires can be triggered by combustible gases from disintegrating garbage. Images and video released by officials showed workers racing to extinguish the billowing flames that sent thick plumes of toxic smoke rising high into the sky.   While the fire has been largely put out, a thick cloud of smoke and methane gas continues to cover the area, reducing visibility and the city’s air quality, while emitting a lingering, pungent odor.   Some firefighters had fainted from the fumes, the fire department said.   Kerala’s top court said it will take up the case on Tuesday.    A thick, toxic haze has cloaked the area, choking residents. ReutersIndia creates more methane from landfill sites than any other country, according to GHGSat, which monitors emissions via satellites. Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide – but it is a more potent contributor to the climate crisis because it traps more heat.   As part of his “Clean India” initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal, if achieved, could relieve some of the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these enormous dump sites – and help the world lower its greenhouse gas emissions.  SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP/AFP via Getty Imagesvideo    Devotees bathe in sacred river covered in toxic foamBut while India wants to lower its methane output, it hasn’t joined the 150 countries that have signed up to the Global Methane Pledge, a pact to collectively cut global emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Scientists estimate the reduction could cut global temperature rise by 0.2% – and help the world reach its target of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.  India says it won’t join because most of its methane emissions come from farming – some 74% from farm animals and paddy fields versus less than 15% from landfill.   In 2021, India’s environment minister Ashwini Choubey said pledging to reduce the country’s total methane output could threaten the livelihood of farmers and impact the economy. But environmentalists say the country is facing a dire climate challenge from its steaming mounds of trash.India’s trash mountainsBrahmapuram is just one of some 3,000 Indian landfills overflowing with decaying waste and emitting toxic gases.  Commissioned in 2008, the landfill is spread across 16 acres, according to a 2020 report from the International Urban Cooperation, a European Union program.  The landfill receives about 100 metric tons of plastic waste each day, the study added, of which only about 1% is suitable for recycling. The remaining 99% is dumped as a heap at the site, the study said, calling it a “menace for the municipal corporation.”  “The plastic dump at Brahmapuram is increasing in size day by day,” it said. “It has seen several fires over the past few years, thus polluting the air and the environment.”   Despite its growing size and threats, the landfill is not India’s largest. The Deonar dumping ground in the western coastal city of Mumbai, which stands at some 18 stories high, claims the top spot.   Deonar has also seen sporadic fires break out, enveloping about a million residents in the nearby Chembur, Govandi and Mankhurd suburbs.   Ragpickers at the Bhalswa landfill site that is still fighting fire in New Delhi, India on April 28, 2022. Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesA trash heap 62 meters high shows the scale of India's climate challengeThere is no formal processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government’s Central Pollution Board. Rag pickers from nearby slums often trek up the towering mounds and scour through the waste for a few cents per day, but they are not trained in properly segregating it.   In some cases, the trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads.  Last year, firefighters worked for days to extinguish flames after a fire broke out at Delhi’s Ghazipur landfill – the capital city’s largest.   Standing at 65 meters (213 feet), it is nearly as tall as the historic Taj Mahal, becoming a landmark in its own right and an eyesore that towers over surrounding homes, affecting the health of people who live there.  And methane emissions aren’t the only hazard that stem from the landfill. Over decades, dangerous toxins have seeped into the ground, polluting the water supply for thousands living nearby.  At Bhalswa, one of Delhi’s other large landfills, residents have complained of deep, painful skin gashes and respiratory issues from years of living near the hazardous mound.   Smoke billows from burning garbage at the Bhalswa landfill in New Delhi, India, April 27, 2022. Adnan Abidi/ReutersIn a 2019 report, the Indian government recommended ways to improve the country’s solid waste management, including formalizing the recycling sector and installing more compost plants in the country.  While some improvements have been made, such as better door-to-door garbage collection and processing of waste, India’s landfills continue to grow in size.   And as the country is expected to soon overtake China as the the world’s most populous nation, climate experts fear time to act upon the issue is running out.

The ex-president and the Florida governor’s escalating shadow campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to exacerbate the already growing antipathy among grassroots conservatives for being Ukraine’s arsenal of democracy.  This should worry the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has profusely thanked Americans for their multi-billion dollar generosity while warning he will keep asking for more.  Video Ad Feedback'If I were Donald Trump, I'd be really worried': Gergen on possible DeSantis showdown    02:39   - Source:CNNA bitter Republican primary that turns on the isolationist sentiment of the party’s “Make America Great Again” wing could produce a nominee, and possibly a 47th president, who could shelve the assurance of Joe Biden that Americans will stand by Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”   There are already early signs of ebbing public support for Biden’s repeated aid and arms packages for Ukraine a year after Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally, has warned against a “blank check” for Ukraine. The reaction of the ex-president’s proteges in the GOP-controlled House to Biden’s daring secret visit to Kyiv last month suggests that the 2024 Republican nominee will surely cater to a base that believes the US should spend its money securing its own borders instead of Ukraine’s and that Biden cares more for foreigners than Americans.  Donald J. Trump (L) and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.Getty ImagesTrump and DeSantis stake out sharpest preview yet of possible 2024 showdownRecent polling helps explain the GOP positioning on Ukraine. Support for the US providing weapons to the country has decreased compared with last spring, according to an AP-NORC survey conducted in late January, and that decline was sharper among Republicans – down to 39% from 53% in May 2022.   Trump has no love lost for Zelensky, after what he misleading described as their “perfect” 2019 phone call, in which the then-president tried to use US military aid to extort his counterpart into opening an investigation into Biden. The incident led to Trump’s first impeachment. More recently, in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Trump seemed eager to rekindle his genuflecting relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom much of the world now regards as a war criminal. And the need to defend a democracy that is under attack is a foreign concept to Trump at home, let alone abroad.  “Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled. … I will get the problem solved. And I will get it solved in rapid order and it will take me no longer than one day,” Trump said. “I know exactly what to say to each of them,” he added, before hinting at a potential strategy of siding with the aggressor in the war by reminding his audience, “I got along very well with Putin.”  DeSantis, whose foreign policy views remain mostly a mystery, has not been as clear as Trump on what he would do in Ukraine. After all, he’s not even a declared candidate yet, despite fresh signs he is heading in that direction. But he appeared to try to catch up with Trump when warning in a recent Fox News interview that the Biden administration had “no clear, strategic objective identified” in Ukraine and that it was not in US interests to get involved in a proxy war with China there, after the White House warned Beijing could start sending arms to Russia.  This is an evolution from his position as a congressman in 2014 and 2015, when he strongly supported arming Ukraine to fight Russia, CNN’s KFile reported.   Getty ImagesGOP 2024 hopefuls divided over US role in Ukraine warPutin, of course, is listening. The Russian leader appears to be digging in for a forever war in Ukraine – where he has already been entrenched since 2014 after the illegal annexation of Crimea. Even hints that a new Republican president would cut Kyiv loose would play into his apparent belief that, eventually, the West will get tired and splinter. After all, Germany only agreed to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine after Biden also agreed that more advanced US M1 Abrams tanks would also be shipped to the battlefield.  And even if Kyiv prevails in the conflict, or reaches a currently unlikely peace deal with Moscow, its future could rely on being a de facto NATO protectorate armed with Western weapons and even security guarantees from major US or European powers that some future Republican presidents, judging by current rhetoric, might be loath to honor.  Not every Republican agrees with Trump or DeSantis on Ukraine. Many of the key committee chairmen in the House, for instance, back current or even increased aid and military hardware for Ukraine and support its call for F-16 fighter jets that Biden has declined to send. And several potential Republican primary candidates also support the US effort. Former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who launched her campaign last month and paints herself as a would-be scourge of strongmen leaders like Putin and China’s Xi Jinping, tweeted last year: “This isn’t just a war for Ukraine, this is a war for freedom.”  But presidential primaries have a habit of defining a party’s positions at the extremes – and with Trump and DeSantis being seen as the current favorites, their rivals may come under increasing pressure to fall into line to ensure their own political viability.  Ukraine’s primary focus is on the battle, amid fresh signs that its desperate resistance in the city of Bakhmut may be about to be broken.  But the possibility of changing political conditions in the United States as a new White House campaign begins means that Zelensky’s desperation for more weapons and ammunition to eject Putin’s forces from Ukraine will only become more urgent.Trump sees an opening to go after DeSantis on UkraineTrump made clear in his appearance at CPAC that if he gets the chance to confront Biden in a repeat of the 2020 election, he will accuse the Democrat of leading the planet to the brink of disaster.  “I am the only candidate who can make this promise, I will prevent, very easily, World War III,” Trump said in a speech riddled with falsehoods. “We are going to have World War III, by the way, if something doesn’t happen fast.”  The former president is in some ways repeating his 2016 tactic of warning about America’s exposure to foreign wars. He’s trying to fan fatigue over US arms-length involvement in Ukraine as he did over the long conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.  And he drove home another familiar criticism of presidents who fixate on foreign policy by showing up in East Palestine, Ohio – at the site of a chemical spill after a freight train derailment – while Biden was visiting Europe last month.  “I sincerely hope that when your representatives and all of the politicians get here, including Biden, they get back from touring Ukraine, that he’s got some money left over,” Trump said.  CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported Monday that the former president also sees an opening to target DeSantis over his calls as a congressional candidate in 2012 to privatize some social benefits by suggesting he is not sufficiently in line with the GOP base in stopping financial and military aid to Ukraine.  “We are never going back to a party that wants to give unlimited money to fight foreign endless wars but demands we cut veteran benefits and retirement benefits at home,” Trump said during his CPAC speech.  Video Ad Feedback'Absolute fiction': Daniel Dale fact-checks Trump's CPAC speech    04:04   - Source:CNN    DeSantis and his foreign policy views are still a work in progressIn his new book “The Courage to be Free,” published last week, the Florida governor doesn’t mention Ukraine. But he does criticize the mantra laid out by President George W. Bush in his second inaugural address – that “the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the liberty in other lands.” DeSantis writes that this “messianic impulse—that the US had both the right and the obligation to promote democracy, by force, if necessary, around the world — was grounded in Wilsonian moralism, not in a clear-eyed view of American interests.”  This perspective seems incompatible with Biden’s characterization of the US’ support for Ukraine as part of a vital national interest to protect democracy.  Marco Bello/Reuters/FILEDeSantis agenda -- and potential campaign platform -- in the spotlight as Florida lawmakers return to workBut DeSantis is tapping into a familiar seam of opinion.  The sense among many voters that Bush overreached and led Americans into disastrous years-long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was not just a motivating force that helped the rise of Trump’s populist nationalism in the Republican Party. President Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 2008 warning that he was against “dumb wars.”  There is some reluctance to get involved in foreign wars again among American voters on the right and left. A group of Democratic members of Congress, for example, last year called for negotiations to end the war, despite the lack of indications that Putin has any willingness to withdraw his troops. But they were criticized by their colleagues for such a move.  And Iraq and Afghanistan are not a clean analogy for Ukraine – whatever Republican candidates might say – since Biden has scrupulously avoided the involvement of any US forces, as he seeks to head off a dangerous direct clash with nuclear-armed Moscow.  Biden’s need to shore up public support for an extended commitment to Ukraine was one reason why he went to Ukraine to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion.  “When united, Americans of all political backgrounds decided that they would step up. The American people know it matters. Unchecked aggression is a threat to all of us,” Biden told Zelensky in Kyiv.  “You remind us that freedom is priceless; it’s worth fighting for for as long as it takes. And that’s how long we’re going to be with you, Mr. President: for as long as it takes.”  But with the battle on the edge of Europe not looking like it will end any time soon, Biden may have to make that case on the debate stage with a Republican nominee next year – which suggests the clock maybe ticking for Ukraine.

Investor Mark Mobius says he cannot get his money out of China    			By Reuters  Published  5:25 AM EST, Mon March 6, 2023    Link Copied!   Mark Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners, is photographed in Hong Kong in 2018. Justin Chin/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMark Mobius has said he cannot take his money out of China due to the country’s capital controls, cautioning investors to be “very, very careful” about investing in an economy under a tight government grip.  “I have an account with HSBC in Shanghai. I can’t take my money out. The government is restricting flow of money out of the country,” Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital Partners, told FOX Business in an interview published on March 2.

They don’t say: No, you can’t get your money out. But they say: give us all the records from 20 years of how you made this money … This is crazy.”  Mobius’ comments were circulated on Chinese social media site WeChat at the weekend.  Mobius led emerging market investment at Franklin Templeton Investments for three decades and is known for his bullish view on China. Now, though, he said, he “would be very, very careful” investing in the country.  “The bottom line is that China is moving in a completely different direction than what Deng Xiaoping instituted when they started the big reform program,” he said, referring to the former Chinese leader.

It's just pulling different strings“Now you have a government which is taking golden shares in companies all over China. That means they’re going to try to control all of these companies … So I don’t think it’s a very good picture when you see the government becoming more and more control-oriented in the economy.”  Mobius, who calls himself “the Indiana Jones of Emerging Market investing,” told FOX Business he’s increasing exposure to alternative markets such as India and Brazil.

In the past few months alone, Japan has pledged to double defense spending and acquire long-range weapons from the US; South Korea has acknowledged that stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential to its security; the Philippines has announced new US base access rights and is talking about joint patrols of the South China Sea with Australia, Japan and the United States.  Those might be the biggest initiatives, but they are far from the only events that have left China increasingly isolated in its own backyard as it refuses to condemn the invasion of a sovereign country by its partner in Moscow while keeping military pressure on the self-ruled island of Taiwan.  Analysts say all these things would have likely happened without the war in Ukraine, but the war, and China’s backing of Russia, has helped grease the skids to get these projects done.  Take the situation of Japan, a country limited in its post-World War II constitution to “self-defense” forces. Now it’s going to buy long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US, weapons that could strike well inside China.  “I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a major defense conference in Singapore last summer.  In December, Kishida followed that up with a plan to double Tokyo’s defense spending while acquiring weapons with ranges well outside Japanese territory.

Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty Image/File“The Japanese people have certainly taken notice of the situation in Ukraine, and it has made them feel more vulnerable as a nation,” said John Bradford, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratman School of International Studies in Singapore.  The nation that Japan feels particularly vulnerable to is China.  The People’s Liberation Army has been growing and modernizing its forces for years. On Sunday, Beijing announced  its military budget for 2023, which will increase 7.2%. It marked the first time in the past decade that the military’s budget growth rate has increased for three consecutive years.  “The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board, develop new military strategic guidance, devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and make well-coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang said in a government work report.  China’s ruling Communist Party has for years been pressuring Taiwan. It sees the island as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and Chinese leader Xi has repeatedly refused to rule out the use of force in “reunifying” it with the Chinese mainland.  There’s worry that China may one day treat Taiwan as Russia has treated Ukraine.  Leaders in Tokyo have said peace across the Taiwan Strait is essential to Japan’s security. That’s really nothing new, but the urgency in Japan is.  “Japan has been strengthening its defense posture for years. The Ukraine situation made the key element of Kishida’s new National Security Strategy, the expected next steps in this strengthening, politically easier,” Bradford said.  In this handout image provided by the South Korean Defense Ministry, the US aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and South Korean warships seen during a US-South Korea combined naval exercise on September 29.South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty ImagesIn the current climate, the leadership in South Korea is watching Taiwan through a similar lens.  “Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and it’s indispensable for security and prosperity of the region as a whole,” Foreign Minister Park Jin told CNN recently.  There’s worry in Seoul that if US forces are drawn into any conflict with China over Taiwan, South Korea will look vulnerable in the eyes of Kim Jong Un in nuclear-armed North Korea.  That’s led to calls for South Korea to be more reliant on its own self-defense, including some calling for it to acquire its own nuclear weapons.   Meanwhile, Seoul and Tokyo are working more closely together on defense matters, including joint naval exercises with the US.  South Korea is also seeing increasing demands for the weapons it produces, like tanks, howitzers and fighter jets.  South Korea, the United States and Japan held a joint missile defense drill at the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula on February 22. South Korean Defence MinistryIt signed a mulitibillion-dollar deal with Poland, Ukraine’s neighbor to the West and part of the US-led NATO alliance, for all of those items. And it is selling them in the region as well.   In the past month, Korea Aerospace Industries has announced it will sell 18 of its FA-50 light fighter jets to Malaysia.  Another operator of those FA-50s is the Philippines. Manila is also a customer for Korean-made warships and offshore patrol vessels.   And the web of cooperation gets even more intricate.   The Philippines is in talks with the US, Australia and Japan for joint patrols in the South China Sea, where China occupies islands that the Philippines also claims.   And Manila last month agreed to give Washington increased access to military facilities in the archipelago.  China may have been its own biggest detractor when it comes to the Philippines, regardless of what it was doing about the Ukraine war, analysts said.  Former President Rodrigo Duterte was not a fan of Washington and looked for ways to work with Bejing. But China never really showed any appreciation for that and his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has shown himself eager to work with the US and its allies, the analysts said.  “It is difficult for the new Marcos administration to justify accommodating Beijing’s policy preferences when previous attempts at doing so by the previous government were not reciprocated,” said Jeffrey Ordaniel, director of maritime security at the Pacific Forum and an assistant professor at Tokyo International University.  “Beijing’s continued bullying, like we saw in the case of the China Coast Guard blinding Philippines Coast Guard sailors with a laser (recently), has only helped to make the case for a stronger alliance” with Washington, said Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  A photo released by the Philippine Coast Guard is alleged to show a Chinese coast guard ship aiming a laser at a Philippine vessel earlier this year.Philippine Coast GuardChina’s pressure on the Philippines has repercussions on the opposite side of the South China Sea, analysts said.  “Singapore and Vietnam have become even more open to greater US footprints in the region. They don’t want China to dominate Southeast Asia,” Ordaniel said.  But the Ukraine war has not been helpful in one key American partnership in the Indo-Pacific, the informal Quad alliance linking the US, Japan, Australia and India, according to analysts.  India, unlike the other three members, has not condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.  “When the US, Australia, and Japan tried to condemn Russia through a joint statement, India refused…. India claimed that the Quad only tackles Indo-Pacific challenges, and since Russia isn’t in the region, this topic cannot be broached,” said Derek Grossman, senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.  But he said that split in the Quad doesn’t really distract from its focus.   “The Quad is all about how to deal with China,” Grossman said.

Beijing enjoys a close relationship with Moscow, and the Chinese government has been purchasing Russian energy and supplying machinery, electronics, base metals, vehicles, ships and aircraft, throwing the Kremlin an economic lifeline.    In recent months, tensions between the United States and China have increased as the countries compete for dominance of the microchip industry and argue over tariffs, US support for Taiwan and potential spy balloons.   Dimon said JPMorgan Chase is taking an active role in improving the relationship between the United States and China by advising and engaging with both governments on keeping cordial relations. He’s hoping that “cooler heads prevail” but he doesn’t believe a business solution exists to ease growing disputes. While JPMorgan Chase does a fair share of business with Beijing, it’s the government, not private enterprise, that has to smooth tensions, he said.   “We probably should have started resetting this 10 years ago,” he said. The US government has to sit down and have a “very serious conversation with the Chinese government,” he said.   Dimon added that he believes the war in Ukraine could continue for years to come. A soft landingOn the home front, Dimon is still holding out hope for the possibility that the Federal Reserve can execute a soft landing — lowering interest rates while avoiding recession. But overall, his outlook remains cloudy.   “A mild recession is possible, a harder recession is possible,” he said Monday. “I think there’s a good chance that inflation will come down, but not enough by the fourth quarter — the Fed may actually have to do more,” he said.   Dimon did note that the US consumer is still very healthy: Home prices and wages are high, households still have more money in their bank accounts than they did before the pandemic and they’re still spending it.   Consumers are in great shape, he said. “But that’s going to end at some point.”   Still, even if America does enter a recession, he said, consumers are much stronger and will be able to better withstand a downturn than they were in 2008.

Video Ad FeedbackJill Biden reacts to Nikki Haley's call for presidential competency test    00:31   - Source:CNNCNN      First lady Dr. Jill Biden warned parts of East Africa are “on the precipice” of famine as the region is dealing with a severe drought, threatening livelihoods and the ability of families to feed their children.  Her comments came in a series of wide-ranging interviews during a recent five-day trip to Africa that were part of “CNN Primetime: Jill Biden Abroad.” In the interviews, she shared her thoughts about the 2024 presidential campaign, weighed in on the classified documents found at their Wilmington, Delaware, home, and talked about life as first lady, including relationships with the women who held the role in the past.  As the Bidens prepare for a possible 2024 presidential campaign, the first lady pushed back on concerns about President Joe Biden’s age, citing his recent travel schedule as reflective of his stamina.  “How many 30-year-olds could travel to Poland, get on the train? Go nine more hours, go to Ukraine, meet with President (Volodymyr) Zelensky?” she said. “So, look at the man. Look what he’s doing. Look what he continues to do each and every day.”  Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has called for politicians over the age of 75 to take mental competency tests, which the first lady called, “Ridiculous.” Asked if her husband, who would be 82 at his inauguration if he’s reelected, would ever take such a test, she said, “We would never even discuss something like that.”  During an extensive sit-down with CNN, Jill Biden said she “absolutely” believes her husband will run for reelection in 2024, saying she’s “all for it.” But the first lady also left an opening for her husband should he decide against a run.“It’s Joe’s decision,” she said. “And we support whatever he wants to do. If he’s in, we’re there. If he wants to do something else, we’re there too.”  The first lady said her family has not had one definitive sit-down meeting to discuss a reelection bid as has been typical for the Biden clan in the past, saying instead there’s been a series of rolling conversations with their children and grandchildren.  She said the wave of investigations into her son, Hunter Biden, a frequent target for Republicans, has not affected the family’s thinking about 2024.  “I love Hunter, and I’ll support him … in any way I can. And that’s how I look at things,” she said.  The first lady also weighed in for the first time on the revelation that classified documents were found at the president’s Wilmington residence and a private office in Washington, DC, which prompted the Justice Department to assign a special counsel to investigate the matter.  CNNvideo    Hear what first lady thinks about Biden's reelection plans“I was really surprised. We had no idea,” she said, noting the documents at their Wilmington home were in the garage. “Believe me, Arlette, I haven’t been, I mean, I don’t have time to go through, you know, the boxes in the garage. We had no idea they were even down there.” The first lady in Africa The first lady traveled to Africa for visits to Namibia and Kenya to emphasize the United States’ commitment to the region at a time when Russia and China have made in-roads on the continent.  “America wants to keep reassuring the countries and the leaders of Africa, like - ‘We didn’t forget you.’ You know, we were isolationist, pretty much for the last four years of the last administration,” she said in a critique of former President Donald Trump. “We want to say, ‘Hey, we’re back.’”  It marked her sixth trip to Africa after having traveled to the continent five times as second lady. She focused on delivering messages about women’s empowerment, youth engagement, and the need to preserve democracy.  Biden also highlighted programs funded through PEPFAR, the Bush-era initiative focused on fighting HIV/AIDS around the globe, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.  On her final day in Kenya, the first lady looked to shine a spotlight on the severe drought affecting the region. She traveled to the rural village of Lositeti in Kajiado County to tour a health clinic offering services to the community.   Nearly 500 patients, many of them children, received treatment that day, including medical and malnutrition check-ups and nutritional assistance, according to the US Agency for International Development.  “Livestock is dying. There’s no water. There’s no grass. There are no crops. Mothers can’t lactate. They’re not able to feed their children. It’s a major problem,” she said. “I’m here before it gets any worse to try to create awareness and say, ‘How can we find solutions for these major problems?’”  In Kenya, officials say more than 4 million people have insufficient access to food, with that figure expected to rise above 5 million in the coming months.  The first lady noted the US provides 70% of financial assistance to the drought-plagued region and urged other countries to pitch in with more aid.  “Everybody has to come together to make sure that these people aren’t dying because of the drought,” she said. “Because believe me … they have nothing. They have nothing and their children are malnourished.”  In 2011, Biden visited the same region to highlight the impact of drought and famine. She toured the country’s largest refugee camp in Dadaab, where more than 100,000 Somali refugees fled to amid famine and conflict.   “We’re right on the precipice I think of a famine,” she told CNN. “We’re right on the edge. We need to act now.” Reflecting on Jimmy Carter and other first ladies The first lady also reflected on the legacy of former President Jimmy Carter, who recently started receiving hospice care.  “I think he’ll be remembered as a great humanitarian, I mean, all that he has done to help people,” she said. “He never stopped. He never stopped helping Americans, whether it was Habitat for Humanity, building homes, or going into communities, traveling the world helping people all over.”  The president and first lady visited with Carter and his wife, former first Lady Rosalynn Carter, at their Plains, Georgia, home in 2021. Dr. Biden said the two men “talked politics the whole time and what was going on, and they have a real ease in with one another,” and she praised the couple’s seven-decades long marriage.  “She’s so much a part of his life,” she said. “It’s a really strong partnership.”  Biden said Rosalynn Carter has “always been very supportive, as have quite frankly, most of the first ladies. “  “If you ever need anything or you want to talk or if there’s something … on your mind, or if I can help you in some way, they’ve all been great,” she said.  Asked if she’s spoken with former first lady Melania Trump, she responded: “Not Melania.”  The first lady said she plans to offer advice to future first spouses, saying “if they ask, of course, I mean, it’s a very small number, at this point, of women, and I think we have to support one another.”Insight into the Bidens’ marriageBiden also offered a window into her marriage, saying she maintains a “good balance” in the types of insight and advice she offers her husband.  “Certainly I tell him stories, and I have things that I’ve seen and things that people want and where their challenges are,” she said. “So, it’s not that I’m like weighing in. It’s like, let me tell you what I saw or what I heard, or what people are saying to me.”  “It’s in that context because I’m out every day. I’m in the classroom. I’m out, you know, somewhere in the United States,” she added. “I think it’s a good balance really.”  Biden said her husband helps her understand there are different ways of looking at issues and viewpoints.  “Well, sometimes I don’t, I may not see things from his perspective. Let’s just put it that way. And so, he offers both sides,” she said. “I’m always better like ‘This person feels this way.” ‘Yes, but this is why they,’ – you know, he’s very good at that – understanding why people feel the way they do. He understands both sides, which is part of his strength.”  Biden, who has been married to the president for nearly 46 years, has long said she’s not an adviser to her husband, but she is his most trusted partner and wields a significant amount of influence within the White House.   The couple speaks often via text and FaceTime throughout the day as they both maintain busy work and travel schedules with the first lady saying the president “calls a lot.”  Biden said she “said a lot of prayers” when her husband made a highly secretive to Kyiv, Ukraine – an active war zone where the US military has no control – last month.  “I was really worried. But you know, one thing, and I have to say this with all my heart. One thing that I truly believe in is the strength of our military, and how everything was so planned out, and the Secret Service, and what an amazing job they did, in pulling off the trip, and keeping my husband safe,” she said.A unique first lady Biden plays a unique role as first lady, the first to hold a full-time paid job outside of the White House. She teaches English and writing full time at Northern Virginia Community College, a job she also held for her eight years as second lady when her husband was vice president.   From her perch at the White House, she has spent time advocating for education issues, helping military families through her “Joining Forces” initiative and working to end cancer through the “Cancer Moonshot.” The first lady is one of the Biden administration’s most often used surrogates at events across the country.  “I think it’s all so interesting and really fulfilling for me as, as a teacher, and as a woman, you know, to see the empowerment of other young women in them getting education,” she said when asked how she balance the two roles. “There’s nothing I can ever give up.”  “I really feel like I’ve grown so much in this role, because of the opportunities that I’ve been given whether it’s traveling to Africa, or whether it’s traveling to Nebraska,” she added. “I see so many different communities and reach out to people in all walks of life.”  Biden said her experiences as an educator and first lady have helped her build connections with people during her travels abroad, which has included trips to 10 countries in her first two years in the White House.   “Joe tends towards policy,” she said. “I try to, you know, go in a little bit maybe a softer direction.”  While in Africa, Biden held events with the first ladies of Namibia and Kenya, telling CNN it’s important to cultivate those types of relationships abroad.  “One thing Joe taught me is that all politics is personal, and that’s true because once you have these connections, I think you can call on someone when you need help, when you need to be lifted up, when you can support programs,” she said.

NIAID-RMLWashingtonCNN      Eight Republican senators are pressing Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to provide them with the raw materials that informed the intelligence community’s latest assessment on the origins of Covid-19, according to a letter they sent Haines on Monday.  “We write to request that you immediately deliver to Congress each IC assessment used and relied upon by the Office of the Director National Intelligence (ODNI) for its consensus publications,” the senators wrote Haines, adding that they are giving Haines until March 20 to provide them with the requested information.   Earlier this year, Congress received a summary of the findings of the intelligence community’s continued investigation into the origins of Covid-19. But the Republican senators – now expressing skepticism about the summary report itself – are specifically requesting “the actual individual IC assessments” instead of a summary of what those assessments found.  The request was prompted by a recent low confidence assessment from the Department of Energy that Covid-19 most likely originated from a laboratory leak in China. The assessment – which matches a moderate confidence finding by the FBI – remains the minority view within the intelligence community, but it has reanimated a debate over the origins of the worldwide pandemic.  “DNI Haines currently faces a critical decision – whether to be transparent with Congress and stop obstructing the agencies involved in the IC assessment from turning over their results or continue to hide key details from the American people and their elected officials. There are many questions about ODNI’s process that must be answered. Was it tainted by outside experts who had conflicts of interest?  Why was Congress not updated in real time with new assessments? I will continue to seek the truth for Kansans and all Americans,” Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican who signed the letter, said in a statement to CNN.

Biden administration officials and intelligence sources have repeatedly said that the conclusions are simply inconclusive, pointing to the lack of information that the Chinese have shared on the origins of the virus.“Congress should be able to review the independent evaluations without filters, ambiguity or interpretations of the intelligence. There is clear bipartisan support in Congress to make these assessments available immediately in full as evident by the unanimous March 1, 2023 Senate passage of the COVID-19 Origin Act to declassify information related to the origin of COVID-19,” the senators wrote.  The senators who signed the letter, in addition to Marshall, include Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Joni Ernst, Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. Susan Collins, Sen Marsha Blackburn, Sen Roger Wicker and Sen Mike Braun.   CNN has asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for comment.Request for detailed briefingThe senators are also requesting a detailed briefing from ODNI about the process behind analyzing material across government on the topic. They specifically want to know how ODNI synthesized and processed the information, particularly material which did not come from the intelligence community such as information from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They also want to know if each IC assessment was given equal weight and how “any differences in analytic judgment were fully considered and brought to the attention of the White House.”  As they dig into this inquiry, the senators claim that when the intelligence community was tasked by the White House with doing a 90-day review to evaluate the origins of Covid-19 in March 2021, the decision to rely on the intelligence community – instead of entities across government – “all but eliminated the U.S. government’s ability to openly share assessment results with any meaningful transparency.”  The third line of questions from the senators is related to the credentials and experience of the individuals involved in the ODNI summary.  “Finally, we are concerned that the world-class credentials of the scientists and other experts of the IC elements was not matched by the ODNI reviewers,” the letter writes. “If ODNI does not make all IC individual assessments available to congress, then it will be important for ODNI to provide full descriptions of the credentials, training, experience and job titles about each individual involved in ODNI’s synthesis of IC assessments, to include all detailees, individuals on interagency personnel agreements, unpaid consultants, federal contractors and political appointees.”  This general view shows the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province on February 3, 2021, as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus, visit.

The senators write that the investigation into the origins of the pandemic have been “obfuscated” by the Chinese communist government’s lack of cooperation.   Administration officials have said that they agree with that sentiment, but they have also said that the US government does not have a consensus on the origins of the virus.  “What the president wants is facts. He wants the whole government designed to go get those facts. And that’s what we’re doing and we’re just not there yet,” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters last month. “And when we’re there yet, and if we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress – than we’re going to do that.”  A report from 2021 issued by ODNI revealed that the National Intelligence Council, along with four other unidentified agencies, assessed with low confidence that the initial Covid-19 infection “was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus.”  But the Republican senators argue that “ODNI has failed to be transparent with Congress and the American people” about their process of reviewing the different assessments.  “It is time for the Administration to declassify the assessments, make the information available to the public, and start building the public’s trust through transparency,” they wrote.   The congressional source familiar with the letter echoed those sentiments.  “We have sources that know that what was represented in these summaries – not just this one, but in the larger classified report – that there is reason to question the completeness and objectivity of how the information has been representative,” the source said.

Smoke billows from the Iskenderun Port as rescue workers work at the scene of a collapsed building on February 07, in Iskenderun, Turkey. Burak Kara/Getty ImagesEditor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.Abu Dhabi, UAECNN      The devastating earthquake that hit Turkey on February 6 killed at least 45,000 people, rendered millions homeless across almost a dozen cities and caused immediate damage estimated at $34 billion – or roughly 4% of the country’s annual economic output, according to the World Bank.    But the indirect cost of the quake could be much higher, and recovery will be neither easy nor quick.   The Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation estimates the total cost of the quake at $84.1 billion, the lion’s share of which would be for housing, at $70.8 billion, with lost national income pegged at $10.4 billion and lost working days at $2.91 billion.    “I do not recall… any economic disaster at this level in the history of the Republic of Turkey,” said Arda Tunca, an Istanbul-based economist at PolitikYol.    Turkey’s economy had been slowing even before the earthquake. Unorthodox monetary policies by the government caused soaring inflation, leading to further income inequality and a currency crisis that saw the lira lose 30% of its value against the dollar last year. Turkey’s economy grew 5.6% last year, Reuters reported, citing official data.   Economists say those structural weaknesses in the economy will only get worse because of the quake and could determine the course of presidential and parliamentary elections expected in mid-May.     Still, Tunca says that while the physical damage from the quake is colossal, the cost to the country’s GDP won’t be as pronounced when compared to the 1999 earthquake in Izmit, which hit the country’s industrial heartland and killed more than 17,000. According to the OECD, the areas impacted in that quake accounted for a third of the country’s GDP.    The provinces most affected by the February 6 quake represent some 15% of Turkey’s population. According to the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, they contribute 9% of the nation’s GDP, 11% of income tax and 14% of income from agriculture and fisheries.    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan meets with people in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey on Wednesday.Presidential Press Office/ReutersErdogan's political fate may rest on his response to the earthquake “Economic growth would slow down at first but I don’t expect a recessionary threat due to the earthquake,” said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koc University in Istanbul. “I don’t expect the impact on (economic) growth to be more than 1 to 2 (percentage) points.”    There has been growing criticism of the country’s preparedness for the quake, whether through policies to mitigate the economic impact or prevent the scale of the damage seen in the disaster.     How Turkey will rehabilitate its economy and provide for its newly homeless people is not yet known. But it could prove pivotal in determining President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s political fate, analysts and economists say, as he seeks another term in office.  Strong fiscal position  The government’s 2023 budget, released before the earthquake, had planned for increased spending in an election year, foreseeing a deficit of 660 billion liras ($34.9 billion).    The government has already announced some measures that analysts said were designed to shore up Erdogan’s popularity, including a near 55% increase in the minimum wage, early retirement and cheaper housing loans.    Economists say that Turkey’s fiscal position is strong. Its budget deficit, when compared to its economic output, is smaller than that of other emerging markets like India, China and Brazil. That gives the government room to spend.    “Turkey starts from a position of relative fiscal strength,” said Selva Bahar Baziki of Bloomberg Economics. “The necessary quake spending will likely result in the government breaching their budget targets. Given the high humanitarian toll, this would be the year to do it.”     Quake-related public spending is estimated at 2.6% of GDP in the short run, she told CNN, but could eventually reach as high as 5.5%.   Governments usually plug budget shortfalls by taking on more debt or raising taxes. Economists say both are likely options. But post-quake taxation is already a touchy topic in the country, and could prove risky in an election year.    After the 1999 quake, Turkey introduced an “earthquake tax” that was initially introduced as a temporary measure to help cushion economic damage, but subsequently became a permanent tax.    There has been concern in the country that the state may have squandered those tax revenues, with opposition leaders calling on the government to be more transparent about what happened to the money raised. When asked in 2020, Erdogan said the money “was not spent out of its purpose.” Since then, the government has said little more about how the money was spent.     “The funds created for earthquake preparedness have been used for projects such as road constructions, infrastructure build-ups, etc. other than earthquake preparedness,” said Tunca. “In other words, no buffers or cushions have been set in place to limit the economic impacts of such disasters.”    The Turkish presidency didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.    Analysts say it’s too early to tell precisely what impact the economic fallout will have on Erdogan’s prospects for re-election.

(Photo by Adem ALTAN / AFP) (Photo by ADEM ALTAN/AFP via Getty Images)Adem AltanAFP/Getty ImagesEmotions run high in Turkey amid questions over state response to deadly quakeThe president’s approval rating was low even before the quake. In a December poll by Turkish research firm MetroPOLL, 52.1% of respondents didn’t approve of his handling of his job as president. A survey a month earlier found that a slim majority of voters would not vote for Erdogan if an election were held on that day.    Two polls last week, however, showed the Turkish opposition had not picked up fresh support, Reuters reported, citing partly its failure to name a candidate  and partly its lack of a tangible plan to rebuild areas devastated by the quake.  Voter defection The majority of the provinces worst affected by the quake voted for Erdogan and his ruling AK Party in the 2018 elections, but in some of those provinces, Erdogan and the AK Party won with a plurality of votes or a slim majority.   Those provinces are some of the poorest in the country, the World Bank says.   Research conducted by Demiralp as well as academics Evren Balta from Ozyegin University and Seda Demiralp from Isik University, found that while the ruling AK Party’s voters’ high partisanship is a strong hindrance to voter defection, economic and democratic failures could tip the balance.     “Our data shows that respondents who report being able to make ends meet are more likely to vote for the incumbent AKP again,” the research concludes. “However, once worsening economic fundamentals push more people below the poverty line, the possibility of defection increases.”    This could allow opposition parties to take votes from the incumbent rulers “despite identity-based cleavages if they target economically and democratically dissatisfied voters via clear messages.”    For Tunca, the economic fallout from the quake poses a real risk for Erdogan’s prospects.   “The magnitude of Turkey’s social earthquake is much greater than that of the tectonic one,” he said. “There is a tug of war between the government and the opposition, and it seems that the winner is going to be unknown until the very end of the elections.”    Nadeen Ebrahim and Isil Sariyuce contributed to this report. This article has been corrected to say that the research, not the survey, was conducted by the academics. The digest Sub-Saharan African countries repatriate citizens from Tunisia after ‘shocking’ statements from country’s president Sub-Saharan African countries including Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea and Gabon, are helping their citizens return from Tunisia following a controversial statement from Tunisian President Kais Saied, who has led a crackdown on illegal immigration into the North African country since last month.   Background: In a meeting with Tunisia’s National Security Council on February 21, Saied described illegal border crossing from sub-Saharan Africa into Tunisia as a “criminal enterprise hatched at the beginning of this century to change the demographic composition of Tunisia.” He said the immigration aims to turn Tunisia into “only an African country with no belonging to the Arab and Muslim worlds.” In a later speech on February 23, Saied maintained there is no racial discrimination in Tunisia and said that Africans residing in Tunisia legally are welcome. Authorities arrested 58 African migrants on Friday after they reportedly crossed the border illegally, state news agency TAP reported on Saturday. Why it matters: Saied, whose seizure of power in 2021 was described as a coup by his foes, is facing challenges to his rule at home. Reuters on Sunday reported that opposition figures and rights groups have said that the president’s crackdown on migrants was meant to distract from Tunisia’s economic crisis.  Iranian Supreme Leader says schoolgirls’ poisoning is an ‘unforgivable crime’ Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday said that the poisoning of schoolgirls in recent months across Iran is an “unforgivable crime,” state-run news agency IRNA reported. Khamenei urged authorities to pursue the issue, saying that “if it is proven that the students were poisoned, the perpetrators of this crime should be severely punished.”   Background: Concern is growing in Iran after reports emerged that hundreds of schoolgirls had been poisoned across the country over the last few months. On Wednesday, Iran’s semi-official Mehr News reported that Shahriar Heydari, a member of parliament, said that “nearly 900 students” from across the country had been poisoned so far, citing an unnamed, “reliable source.”  Why it matters: The reports have led to a local and international outcry. While it is unclear whether the incidents were linked and if the students were targeted, some believe them to be deliberate attempts at shutting down girls’ schools, and even potentially linked to recent protests that spread under the slogan, “Women, Life, Freedom.” Iran to allow further IAEA access following discussions – IAEA chief Iran will allow more access and monitoring capabilities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), agency Director General Rafael Grossi said at a press conference in Vienna on Saturday, following a trip to the Islamic Republic. The additional monitoring is set to start “very, very soon,” said Grossi, with an IAEA team arriving within a few days to begin reinstalling the equipment at several sites.    Background: Prior to the news conference, the IAEA released a joint statement with Iran’s atomic energy agency in which the two bodies agreed that interactions between them will be “carried out in the spirit of collaboration.” Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said he hopes the IAEA will remain neutral and fair to Iran’s nuclear energy program and refrain from being affected “by certain powers which are pursuing their own specific goals,” reported Iranian state television Press TV on Saturday. Why it matters: Last week, a restricted IAEA report seen by CNN said that uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels have been found at an Iranian nuclear facility, as the US warned that Tehran’s ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating. The president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Mohammad Eslami, rejected the recent IAEA report, which detected particles of uranium enriched to 83.7% at the Fordow nuclear facility in Iran, saying there has been ‘“no deviation” in Iran’s peaceful nuclear activities. Around the region From Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities/FacebookA new sphinx statue has been discovered in Egypt – but this one is thought to be Roman.    The smiling sculpture and the remains of a shrine were found during an excavation mission in Qena, a southern Egyptian city on the eastern banks of the River Nile.    The shrine had been carved in limestone and consisted of a two-level platform, Mamdouh Eldamaty, a former minister of antiquities and professor of Egyptology at Ain Shams University said in a statement Monday from Egypt’s ministry of tourism and antiquities. A ladder and mudbrick basin for water storage were found inside.    The basin, believed to date back to the Byzantine era, housed the smiling sphinx statue, carved from limestone.   Eldamaty described the statue as bearing “royal facial features.” It had a “soft smile” with two dimples. It also wore a nemes on its head, the striped cloth headdress traditionally worn by pharaohs of ancient Egypt, with a cobra-shaped end or “uraeus.”   A Roman stela with hieroglyphic and demotic writings from the Roman era was found below the sphinx.    The professor said that the statue may represent the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth Roman emperor who ruled from the year 41 to 54, but noted that more studies are needed to verify the structure’s owner and history.   The discovery was made in the eastern side of Dendera Temple in Qena, where excavations are still ongoing.    Sphinxes are recurring creatures in the mythologies of ancient Egyptian, Persian and Greek cultures. Their likenesses are often found near tombs or religious buildings.   It is not uncommon for new sphinx statues to be found in Egypt. But the country’s most famous sphinx, the Great Sphinx of Giza, dates back to around 2,500 BC and represents the ancient Egyptian Pharoah Khafre.

National flags of South Korea and Japan are displayed during a meeting between representatives from both countries in Tokyo, Japan, July 31, 2019.  Kim Kyung-Hoon/ReutersSeoul, South KoreaCNN      South Korea on Monday announced a deal to compensate victims of forced labor by Japan during its occupation of Korea as the two United States allies try to smooth relations in the face of an increasingly turbulent Indo-Pacific security situation.  US President Joe Biden hailed the move as “a groundbreaking new chapter of cooperation and partnership between two of the United States’ closest allies.”  South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin on Monday said the government’s Foundation for Victims of Forced Mobilization by Imperial Japan will compensate 15 victims or their family members using private donations.  In 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled Japan’s Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry should compensate 100 million Korean won ($77,000) to each of the 15 South Korean victims involved in the lawsuit who were mobilized during Japan’s occupation between 1910 to 1945.  Only three of the 15 victims that participated in the lawsuit are alive today, all in their 90s.  “We welcome the measures announced by the South Korean government today as a way to restore a healthy relationship between Japan and South Korea, which has been in a very difficult situation since South Korea’s Supreme Court ruling in 2018,” Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.  “The measures announced by the South Korean government are not on the premise that Japanese companies will contribute to the foundation (in South Korea). The Japanese government doesn’t have any particular stance on voluntary donations by individuals or private companies both in Japan and abroad,” he said.  Japan did not agree with the South Korean court’s 2018 decision, and no compensation had been paid by Tokyo.  That led to increased tensions between the two sides, with Japan restricting exports of materials used in memory chips, and South Korea scrapping its military intelligence-sharing agreement with Tokyo during the presidency of  Moon Jae-in, the predecessor to current South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.  History looms large in the Japan-South Korea relationship and the Japanese occupation of Korea – when many Koreans were brutalized and forced to work – is still a highly emotional issue between the two.  South Korea and Japan signed a treaty in 1965 that normalized relations and was supposed to settle most  historical issues.  But South Korea was a military dictatorship at the time, and many Koreans felt the deal was unfair – and today are still fighting against it.  Both sides have also been in a heated dispute for more than 50 years over ownership of a group of islands called Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese.  But the Yoon administration has been striving to improve relations between Seoul and Tokyo, especially as the two US allies face an increasingly volatile security situation with North Korean missile tests that threaten both South Korea and Japan and tensions across the Taiwan Strait, an area that both Tokyo and Seoul say is vital to their respective security.  Under Yoon, South Korea has been striving to come up with a “reasonable solution” that is in the common interest of both countries, while respecting the opinions of the forced labor victims, Foreign Minister Park said Monday.  “I think we need to break the vicious cycle for the people in terms of national interest without neglecting such a prolonged strained relationship between South Korea and Japan,” Park said as he emphasized the importance of bilateral relationship.  Monday’s announcement drew immediate praise from the highest levels in Washington with Biden saying both sides were “taking a critical step to forge a future for the Korean and Japanese people that is safer, more secure, and more prosperous.”  Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said both Yoon and Kishida may face a bumpy road selling the deal to voters.  “Both governments will need to convincingly explain the benefits of the agreement for it to weather criticism from opposition parties and advocacy groups,” Easley said.  Lauren Richardson, director of the Japan Institute at the Australian National University, said Monday’s deal is not likely to satisfy victims in Korea.  “It appears in this case that they’re not particularly happy with the agreement, because obviously, if you’re the victim, or you’re the descendant of a victim, you really want the perpetrator to be held accountable,” Richardson said, noting that the Japanese government is not offering any apology or acknowledging wrongdoing.  “It’s not just about money,” she said. “And so they’re going to look at these and say the Japanese government is kind of in a sense trying to avoid taking responsibility.”  One of the living parties to the lawsuit, 95-year-old Yang Geum-deok, slammed the South Korean government after the deal was announced.  “I cannot understand at all. I’ve never seen anything like this in my 95-year-old life,” Yang said at a press conference.  But analysts said Yoon seems prepared to live with such criticism to achieve broad aims.  Corey Wallace, an East Asia politics and security analyst at Kanagawa University in Japan, said he sees Monday’s agreement as “an outgrowth of Yoon’s much bolder embrace of Japan as a ‘partner’ over the last nine months,” Wallace said.  “Both sides have started to adjust their perceptions of the value of trilateral security cooperation and the costs of bilateral antagonism vis-a-vis North Korea,” he said.   “It is also related to broader concerns in both countries about the sustainability of the US military posture in East Asia given both military developments in North Korea and China and recent events in Europe.”    CNN’s Angus Watson contributed to this report.

China sets lowest GDP growth target in decades as Beijing tightens its belt    			Analysis by Laura He, CNN		  Published  5:10 AM EST, Mon March 6, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackChina plots path forward for economy after end of zero Covid    07:15   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      China’s outgoing Premier Li Keqiang has announced the country’s lowest GDP growth target in decades, highlighting the domestic and global challenges the world’s second largest economy still faces despite its decision late last year to ditch draconian anti-Covid measures.  Li set a target of about 5% growth for 2023 during the National People’s Congress on Sunday, while acknowledging the “many difficulties” the economy is facing. The only year in recent history when the government has been less ambitious was in 2020, when it passed on a numerical target because the economy was nearly paralyzed by the initial Covid outbreak.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks during the opening session of China's National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 5, 2023. Ng Han Guan/AP“Insufficient demand is still a prominent issue,” Li said Sunday. “Stabilizing employment is tough. And some local governments face big fiscal difficulties.”  Perceived as marginalized by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in recent years, Li will be formally stepping down during the congress as part of the biggest shake-up to the country’s economic leadership in a decade.   Li is likely to be departing along with a generation of Western educated, reform-minded officials who have influenced economic policy making over the past 10 years. The new team, tipped to be composed of Xi’s close associates, faces the tough task of reviving the economy.  China is in the midst of a historic downturn for the all-important housing market. Consumer spending is sluggish. Unemployment remains high among the youth.   Business confidence has plummeted following an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on the private sector and increased uncertainties about China’s future policy. Relations between the United States and China are at their lowest point in decades, leading to escalating tensions in technology and investment. Foreign investment in China has slumped.

Last month, protests occurred in the central city of Wuhan and northeastern city of Dalian as hundreds of elderly confronted local officials to oppose changes to their health insurance, which had cut their medical benefits significantly.  Nomura analysts said the 5% growth target suggests “the government is conservative but pragmatic about the economic prospects in 2023, with weakening global demand taking a toll on exports, worsening geopolitical tensions and a still-moderate recovery in the housing sector.”  The new State Council, China’s cabinet, is also “taking a lesson” from the substantial miss in growth target last year, they added.

Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesChina posts one of its worst economic performances in decades because of Covid In 2022, the Chinese economy grew by 3%, the second lowest growth in nearly half a century and behind only 2020. It fell well short of the official growth target of “around 5.5%.”  “Having declared the end of pandemic, the leaders are sticking to the slowing GDP growth path in the long term by lowering annual GDP target gradually,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank.  “Moreover, China has been downplaying the numeric GDP target and shifted to balance the quality since President Xi’s era,” he said. Lower fiscal spendingIn Li’s final report on the work of the government, he called for expanding consumption and set a goal to create around 12 million jobs in towns and cities this year, up from last year’s target of at least 11 million.   Beijing will also allow local governments to issue up to 3.8 trillion yuan ($550 billion) in special bonds in 2023, which will help them build 5G networks, railways, airports and other infrastructure projects, Li added.   But that is lower than last year’s quota of 4.15 trillion yuan ($600 billion) and below market expectations.   The lower target suggests infrastructure growth will slow this year, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING Group.   The government’s fiscal deficit last year was too high, at 8% to 9% per GDP, which has likely reduced its firepower to fund more infrastructure spending, she explained.  Premier Li also said the government would only raise fiscal spending by 5.6% this year, which is lower than the growth of 6.1% in fiscal spending in 2022.  According to the finance ministry’s latest budget report, local government revenue is expected to grow by only 0.4% this year, an indication of Beijing’s conservative forecast on land sales.   Local governments have relied heavily on land sales in the past as a source of revenue but those receipts contracted by 23% in 2022, dealing a blow to finances already strained by huge Covid spending.  “After three years of pandemic [measures], it could be more than desirable for governments, especially the local governments, to restore fiscal resilience,” said Citi analysts.   “Eyeing … fiscal repair and aware of inflation risks, the government work report provides no hint [of] massive fiscal or monetary stimulus,” they said.  Earlier this month, Liu Guoqiang, a deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China, said the economy needs more policy support, but the central bank will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus measures as it seeks to strike a balance between boosting growth and ensuring price stability.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.CNN      It was 10 years ago that “Florida Man” emerged as a buzzy Twitter account documenting outlandish headlines from the Sunshine State, but the meme can be traced back to the 1500s, during the days of Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León’s supposed quest for the fountain of youth in Florida.   In the Washington Post last year, Julio Capó Jr. and Tyler Gillespie tracked the origins of the meme through centuries of colonial and state history, and concluded, “The internet turned Florida Man into a Southern Gothic figure of indulgence, decadence and questionable decisions.”  With the 2024 presidential campaign about to ramp up, Republicans are facing the prospect of having two Florida men as frontrunners. One is the former president, Donald Trump, who despite two impeachments and a sea of legal troubles, still retains a strong hold on the party’s base from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and vowed Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference to be the agent of “retribution” on behalf of aggrieved voters.  The other is the state’s culture-warring governor, Ron DeSantis, the so-far undeclared candidate who grew up on Florida’s Gulf Coast. He is talking up his new book and winning the support of many wealthy donors as early polls show he is the strongest Republican challenger to Trump.   Trump has road-tested a variety of derogatory nicknames for DeSantis, while the governor has only pushed back obliquely. Yet within their party, Trump and DeSantis are aligned — and at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum from yet another Florida man, former Gov. Jeb Bush, who was the early leader of the Republican field for 2016.  “In this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand,” DeSantis declares in his book, sounding a note that Trump could well agree with. The governor, fresh from his battle with Disney, implied that he is best suited to oppose “large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes.”  At CPAC, Trump said, the GOP is “never going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove and Jeb Bush.”  How did DeSantis rise to potentially challenge Trump? Justin Sayfie, a former adviser to Jeb Bush and partner at a lobbying firm, attributes “his rapid national ascent” to “the early pandemic in 2020 when he became a hero to millions for filling a vacuum of leadership at a time of global crisis and uncertainty.”  Clay Jones“Vulnerable older adults in Florida witnessed how he prioritized their health and safety by prohibiting transfers of patients infected with the coronavirus from hospitals into long-term care facilities, unlike in New York,” Sayfie wrote. “Parents of Florida schoolchildren witnessed how he focused on keeping schools open, so students wouldn’t fall behind in their learning. Small-business owners witnessed how he battled to get and keep businesses open, so they and their employees could continue to feed their families during the pandemic.”   And the flood of tourists to Florida took note. Moreover, DeSantis has a knack for picking issues that unite Republicans and divide Democrats, Sayfie observed.   Reading the governor’s new book, Jay Parini noted that “everywhere … one senses his rage against political correctness. He rails, on nearly every page, about ‘the woke agenda’ that he sees permeating almost every level of life in America…”  “The title of this book must surely be ironic: ‘The Courage to Be Free.’ DeSantis is all about the restriction of freedoms wherever possible. He wants to cancel librarians who allow kids to read certain Black or LGBTQ writers and to fire tenured professors in the state university system who teach ‘woke’ ideas. He wants to restrict the rights of women seeking abortions and those of LGBTQ people seeking to live their lives. He hopes to punish corporations, such as the Walt Disney Company, for criticizing his policies.” Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook In Parini’s view, DeSantis is “a chilly man, with a heart of ice and — like so many politicians on both the right and left these days — full of resentments, grudges and the urge to destroy anyone who doesn’t agree with him. … I shudder to think what he might do if handed the presidential bully pulpit.”   The first primaries won’t start until early next year, so there’s still plenty of time for GOP contenders from states other than Florida to jostle for the nomination.

In the day-to-day swirl of life, adults may set those queries aside, but they remain front of mind for many children.   This weekend, CNN Opinion launched the first in a series of videos featuring questions from kids and answers from some of the world’s foremost experts. In a collaboration with the Templeton Foundation, CNN’s Kirsi Goldynia and Mackenzie Happe produced a video in which Anthea, a 9-year-old Brooklyn student, asked theoretical physicist Brian Greene, “What existed before the universe?” We hope you’ll watch Greene’s reply — and let us know what you think.  ‘Crushing’ student loans“Student loan debt is crushing, and it has exploded in the last few decades,” observed Jill Filipovic. Many of the more than 43 million Americans who collectively owe $1.75 trillion dollars cheered when President Joe Biden announced a plan to forgive as much as $20,000 per borrower.   But six Republican-led states and two debt holders have filed lawsuits challenging the policy, claiming it’s “beyond the scope of Biden’s power; he’s using Covid as a pretext, they say, for a law that should be approved by Congress,” Filipovic noted. Supreme Court justices heard arguments in the case Tuesday.  “The Republican talking point,” she added “is that Biden’s plan is a massive taxpayer giveaway, and that he cunningly used Covid as an excuse to push through a policy Congress would have never approved. So it’s worth asking Republican politicians: Why won’t Congress act to relieve student loan debt — even if it means making the uber-wealthy and large corporations pay more in taxes — and improve the economic and personal futures of so many young people?”Lab leakLisa Benson/GoComics.comThe US Department of Energy lent new credibility to the theory that the virus that causes Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, saying last week that it has “low confidence” in that assessment. Then FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency thinks the pandemic “most likely” resulted from a “potential lab incident in Wuhan.”  Peter Bergen noted that “we may never truly know how the Covid-19 virus originated because the Chinese government didn’t allow international inspectors into Wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in December 2019.”  Covid has killed 6.8 million people, including 1.1 million Americans. “And yet the United States hasn’t had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened,” Bergen wrote. A “Covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn’t work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic.”Fox NewsThe release of Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch’s deposition in a legal filing as part of a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems has ignited a new debate over the role of Fox News.   “Murdoch acknowledged that some Fox News hosts — Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo and former host Lou Dobbs — endorsed lies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen; and that he gave Jared Kushner confidential information about President Joe Biden’s ads and debate strategy in 2020,” David Zurawik noted.   “Murdoch’s deposition clearly shows the hypocrisy, dishonesty and lack of anything resembling journalistic ethics at the top and in front of the camera at Fox News.”   Zurawik considered how this will affect the network’s future, writing, “For one thing, Fox was never a news network to begin with. Whereas a news network is a platform built on the premise that one of its first obligations is providing citizens with vetted information that they can use to be free and self-governing, Fox was founded in 1996 as a political platform and run by Roger Ailes, a political operative.”  Now, Zurawik argued, “It’s become so much deeper culturally. Fox News is a world view, a lifestyle, a way of seeing the world, a 24/7 warm bath of false nostalgia and aggrievement primarily for older adults — some of whom are likely feeling left behind or threatened by the changes in American life.”Lori LightfootFour years ago, Lori Lightfoot won nearly 74% of the vote for Chicago’s mayor. On Tuesday, she failed to advance to the runoff, having gained the support of just 17% of voters, David Axelrod pointed out.    “Crime — a perennial issue that has bedeviled mayors for decades — is far and away the top concern of Chicago voters. And while she could claim some progress in the past year over 2021, Lightfoot was widely considered a failure on the critical issue of public safety,” Axelrod wrote. But there were other issues. “Lightfoot’s fall is a more complicated story that goes to a clenched-fist, go-it-alone style of leadership that made consensus hard to build and drove many who should have been her allies away.” Bare minimum MondaysHow’s your Sunday going? According to TikTok creator Marisa Jo Mayes, many people spend the day putting together “insanely long to-do lists” and feeling “paralyzing” pressure to get things ready for the start of the work week.   “As a result,” Holly Thomas wrote, “we hit Mondays primed for stress and unable to focus or engage properly with work. This sense of chaotic unease ripples across the week, costing us more in terms of productivity and vitality than any amount of effort can compensate for. Bare minimum Monday devotees instead make the conscious decision to coast on the first day of the working week, thus conserving their energy. ‘It was like some magic spell came over me,’ Mayes explains. ‘I felt better. I wasn’t overwhelmed, and I actually got more done than I expected.’”  As a millennial, Thomas feels for Mayes and other GenZers grasping for solutions to overwork. “The first several years of my working life passed in a haze of fluorescent office light and breakfasts consumed any time between 4 and 10 am consisting entirely of caffeine pills, Pepsi Max and coffee. I made less money each month than I’d be charged in rent a decade later and conducted my business and relationships in a permanent state of adrenalized exhaustion. …”  “Unlike millennials, who were at least motivated by the hope that it would all be worth it in the end, there’s no such light on the horizon for Gen Z.” Scott AdamsWalt Handelsman/Tribune Content AgencyNewspapers across the country announced they would stop running “Dilbert” after the comic strip’s creator Scott Adams ranted about Black Americans as a “hate group” and told White people to “get the hell away” from them.   Adams complained he was being cancelled, but, as Dean Obeidallah wrote, “this is not ‘cancel culture,’ but ‘consequence culture’ where people are rightly held accountable for their words and actions…”  “Adams is just a prime example of the era we live in, a time when some people will say racist or bigoted remarks and then play the victim card, alleging that they have been victimized by ‘cancel culture’ in hopes of silencing their critics.”  “In the minds of people like him, freedom of expression means being free to spew all the hate-filled garbage they want and in response, requiring the rest of us to bite our tongues. But that’s not how free speech works. People will and should push back against bigotry.”Black History MonthDarrin Bell/King Features SyndicateWinning the NCAA individual all-around title in gymnastics left Onnie Willis Rogers “elated” two decades ago. “But it was a particular kind of joy, tinged with the frustration often felt by the Black athlete who excels in a sport where they are one of only a very few.”   “Even during my four years at UCLA, an urban school with a sizable Black population, I was the only Black female gymnast on my team,” she wrote. “But I’ve noticed something different about gymnasts today, and perhaps you have, as well. There are more Black and brown athletes in the sport than ever before. And they are turning out to be a force to be reckoned with…”  “This year, Fisk University is the first HBCU to have an NCAA gymnastics team — an entire team of Black and brown girls doing gymnastics. It’s radical. It’s transformative. And as Black History Month draws to a close, it’s a reminder of what is possible.”  For more:  Julian Zelizer: Uncovering the forgotten history of slavery in the NorthPeniel E. Joseph: This enduring crime continues to haunt America’s efforts for racial justice    Yemen’s childrenThe actor Thomas Sadoski recently returned from a trip to war-torn Yemen, in conjunction with his work for the humanitarian organization War Child. He wrote that malnutrition affects as many at 95% of children in some areas.   “The resulting stunted physical development had me convinced that I was in a kindergarten classroom when in fact I was meeting with eight and nine-year-olds. And those children were, as a colleague unnervingly put it, ‘the lucky ones.’ Over 2 million Yemeni children are not in school, with far too many of them populating the vast child soldiery one must daily maneuver.”  “Everywhere is the ache of terminal starvation — the nightmarish effects of which include the inability to regulate body temperature, to produce tears when weeping and then a final decline into ghastly, emaciated, lethargic death. All of which I saw, and which Yemenis endure daily: children’s lives snuffed out by globally sanctioned neglect.”  Against this backdrop, Sadoski wrote, “To stand callously by and watch indignity lumped upon depravity heaped upon agony is utterly inhuman. Nevertheless, the wheels are steadily in motion for that outcome, as global aid for Yemen is in staggering decline.”Don’t missBill Bramhall/Tribune Content AgencyFrida Ghitis: The toxic brew poisoning American societySara Stewart: ‘Cocaine Bear’ may actually be a game changerQ&A with Odessa Rae: How Putin’s nemesis finds humor even in the darknessMarion Messmer: The other nuclear threat you might have missed from Putin’s speechCandace Rondeaux: The higher Wagner’s notorious boss rises, the harder he may fallTom Vilsack: How the USDA plans to protect families losing SNAP pandemic benefitsAND…Drew Sheneman/Tribune Content Agency    Physical 100ZooYoung/NetflixJeff Yang is closer to Physical zero than 100, but he’s still hooked on “Physical 100,” the Netflix reality show from South Korea.   “Despite claiming to be a search to find the ultimate physical specimen,” he noted, the show was “was more of an acknowledgment that no such single ideal exists; that different types of bodies excel at different types of achievement, and that all kinds of builds deserve respect.”  “Losers cheered on survivors; winners reached their hands out to help up the fallen; and the symbolic act of trying your hardest delivered the only real victory that matters — victory over fear and self-doubt.”  “As another fan-favorite contestant, 47-year-old MMA fighter Choo Sung-hoon, said after losing in the semifinal round, ‘I wanted to prove that people in their 40s and 50s around the world, like me, can beat young people if they work hard.

Video Ad FeedbackThese are Tom Sizemore's 5 most memorable film roles    01:27   - Source:CNNCNN      Tom Sizemore, an actor known for his work in hit films like “Saving Private Ryan,” “Natural Born Killers” and “Heat,” has died, his representative Charles Lago confirmed to CNN on Friday.   He was 61.   The actor was hospitalized after suffering a brain aneurysm in mid-February, Lago told CNN at the time.   Sizemore “passed away peacefully in his sleep” at Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, with his two sons and his brother, Paul Sizemore, by his side, Lago said in a statement released on behalf of the family.   “I am deeply saddened by the loss of my big brother Tom,” Paul Sizemore said in the statement. “He was larger than life. He has influenced my life more than anyone I know. He was talented, loving, giving and could keep you entertained endlessly with his wit and storytelling ability. I am devastated he is gone and will miss him always.”  On Monday, Sizemore’s family said doctors informed them there was “no further hope” and recommended “end of life decision” due to the condition of his health, according to a statement released. “We are asking for privacy for his family during this difficult time and they wish to thank everyone for the hundreds of messages of support, and prayers that have been received. This has been a difficult time for them.”   Tom Sizemore poses for a portrait at The Collective and Gibson Lounge Powered by CEG, during the Sundance Film Festival, on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP)Victoria Will/Invision/APTom Sizemore's family deciding end of life matters, rep saysBorn in Detroit, Sizemore made a name for himself in Hollywood playing tough guys.   He had an early, small role in the 1989 Oliver Stone film “Born on the Fourth of July” and scored his television break playing Sgt. Vinnie Ventresca in the ABC series “China Beach.”   Sizemore followed that with performances in various films, including “Point Break” in 1991, “True Romance” in 1993, “Natural Born Killers” in 1994 and “Strange Days” in 1995.   His costarring role as Bat Masterson in Kevin Costner’s western “Wyatt Earp” earned Sizemore acclaim. He went on to other major roles in “Pearl Harbor” and “Black Hawk Down,” both released in 2001.    He was perhaps best known for his role as Sgt. Mike Horvath in the 1998 World War II film “Saving Private Ryan.”   Sizemore recently appeared in the Netflix series “Cobra Kai” and the independent supernatural film, “Impuratus.”    Sizemore (front left) had a prominent role in the 1998 film 'Saving Private Ryan.'DreamWorks/Everett Collection    Off screen woes and recoverySizemore’s fame on screen was at times overshadowed by coverage of his life off screen.   Battling substance abuse for years, in 2003 he was convicted of domestic abuse against former girlfriend and Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. He had other legal run-ins and appeared on the VH1 series “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew” in 2010.   That same year he told CNN’s Larry King that he had been addicted to cocaine, heroin and meth.   Sizemore later talked about starring in the comedy series “Barbee Rehab” in a 2022 interview with Decider and was asked if he had some hesitancy in taking on the role.   “There was some, but it was so goofy and so not like rehab that I got over it,” Sizemore said, laughing at the time. “Plus, it wasn’t about drugs. It’s about obsessions and compulsions and… Barbees!”   In the same interview, Sizemore reflected on seeing magic in movies like “The Wizard of Oz” as a child and later as a teen watching “Taxi Driver.”    “I saw that movie every week for, like, two months when it was playing in the theater. I saw it eleven weeks in a row,” Sizemore said. “That’s when I first started thinking, ‘Whatever that is they’re doing up there, I want to be part of it. I want to do that.’”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Entertainment  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Video Ad FeedbackCNN's Richard Quest interviews South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo    04:16   - Source:CNNSeoul, South KoreaCNN      South Korea doesn’t need nuclear arms to deter the threat from North Korea, the country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in an exclusive interview with CNN – even as public opinion swings the other way amid Asia’s accelerating arms race.Several recent public surveys “definitely showed that we should re-arm ourselves. In nuclear capability terms, (the surveys say) we should go farther,” Han told CNN anchor and business editor-at-large Richard Quest during a sit-down in Seoul.  One such poll, released last February, found that 71% of more than 1,300 respondents in the country were in favor of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons – a once-unthinkable idea that has become increasingly mainstream in the past decade, with rising tensions in the Korean Peninsula and dwindling confidence in South Korea toward US protection.  However, Han insisted the country has enough in its arsenal to stave off North Korea’s “preposterous ambitions” – and that developing nuclear capabilities was not “the right way.”  In this handout photo released by the South Korean Defense Ministry, a missile is fired during a U.S. and South Korea joint training exercise to fire a ground-to-ground missile on May 25, 2022 in East Coast, South Korea. South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty ImagesWhy are South Koreans losing faith in America's nuclear umbrella?“We have built up a quite adequate level of our deterrence capabilities in close cooperation with the United States,” he said, adding that the government had “put a lot of emphasis” on strengthening its deterrence since President Yoon Suk Yeol took power last year.   “We should work together with the international community… to put a lot of continuous pressure on North Korea to denuclearize,” he said. “We would like to let North Korea know that developing and advancing nuclear capabilities will not guarantee the peace and prosperity in their country.”  Relations between North and South Korea have worsened in recent years as Pyongyang ramped up its weapons  program, firing a record number of missiles last year – including one that flew over Japan, the first time North Korea had done so in five years, prompting international alarm.  And for months, the US and international observers have warned that North Korea appears to be preparing for its first underground nuclear test since 2017. The country’s dictator Kim Jong Un also intensified his rhetoric last year; he declared his intention to build the “world’s most powerful” nuclear force, warned adversaries that North Korea was fully prepared for “actual war,” vowed to “never give up” nuclear weapons and dismissed the possibility of negotiating denuclearization.  Korean Central TV/ReutersExclusive: North Korea a 'clear and present danger,' says South Korean Foreign MinisterIn response, the US and its allies South Korea and Japan have stepped up their own military drills and cooperation. Yoon, who has publicly taken a tough stance against North Korea, even raised the prospect of South Korea building its own nuclear arsenal, saying in January it could “deploy tactical nuclear weapons or possess its own nukes.”  And despite Han voicing opposition to such a plan, he too emphasized South Korea’s preparedness in confronting its nuclear-armed neighbor – as well as its openness for further talks, under certain conditions.  “We are not disarming ourselves against North Korea,” he said. “But we are not closing the dialogue channel with North Korea … as long as North Korea is abstaining from their very strong nuclear ambitions.”  Video Ad FeedbackKim Jong Un calls for 'exponential' increase in country's nuclear arsenal    02:14   - Source:CNN    China’s roleHan also discussed China’s role in the region, saying the superpower was “not the country it used to be,” in past decades that ushered in economic reforms and liberalization.  “China is a huge and important global player,” he said. “Including Korea, I think many countries would like to see (China) be more compliant with global rules.”  He added that though China “will contribute a lot in solving global problems,” the country often doesn’t meet the “expectations a lot of countries would like to have – for example, we hoped that China would be more aggressive and more active in reducing tensions in the Korean Peninsula.”  For years, China has been North Korea’s biggest trading partner and an economic lifeline, with Pyongyang isolated from much of the world.

(Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images)South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty ImagesWhy Asia's arms race risks spinning out of controlBut Beijing, too, is a major player in the Asia arms race.  In January, US and Japanese ministers warned of the “ongoing and accelerating expansion of (China’s) nuclear arsenal.” Just days later, Japan’s prime minister expressed concern over China’s military activities in the East China Sea, and the launch of ballistic missiles over Taiwan that landed in waters near Japan in August.  China’s military buildup, aggressive foreign policy and multiple disputed territorial claims haven’t gone unnoticed in Seoul – where attitudes toward Beijing are fast souring.  In the 2022 survey on South Korean nuclear armament, more than half of respondents said China would be the biggest threat to the country in 10 years, and many cited “threats other than North Korea” behind their support for a domestic nuclear arsenal.  Han acknowledged that Seoul was closely watching these territorial disputes.   “Peace in the Taiwan Strait is also very important for the security and peace of the Korean Peninsula,” he said. And though South Korea is “committed” to the one-China policy, he said, “at the same time, we (expect) China to be more rule-based, not behaving as a country … being condemned by international community.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Family members hold a remembrance event for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in Kuala Lumpur on March 3, 2018. Lai Seng Sin/ReutersFamilies of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which disappeared mysteriously nearly nine years ago, called on the Malaysian government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane.  The fate of flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.  In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to $70 million if it found the plane. But its operation came up short.  The firm’s search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year $135 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane.  On Sunday, Voice370 – a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane – said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the Malaysian government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful.  “Ocean Infinity, over the last 12 months have made real progress working with many people to further understand… the events in 2014,” Voice370 said in a statement, following a memorial event to mark the ninth year since MH370’s disappearance.  “Ultimately, this has greatly improved their chances of conducting a successful search.”  A Chinese maritime vessel moves through the search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight in  2014.Greg Wood/Pool/Getty ImagesOcean Infinity and Malaysia’s Transport Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  But in a message to families read out at the memorial event, Transport Minister Anthony Loke vowed not to “close the book” on MH370, adding that due consideration would be given to future searches if there was “new and credible information” on the aircraft’s potential location.  Debris confirmed or believed to be from the MH370 aircraft has washed up along the African coast and on islands in the Indian Ocean.  Malaysian investigators previously drew no conclusion about what happened aboard the flight, but did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft had been deliberately taken off course.

Former President Donald Trump arrives to deliver remarks at the South Carolina State House in Columbia on January 28, 2023. Win McNamee/Getty Images/FileCNN      Former President Donald Trump on Friday proposed building up to 10 futuristic “freedom cities” on federal land, part of a plan that the 2024 presidential contender said would “create a new American future” in a country that has “lost its boldness.”   Commuters, meanwhile, could get around in flying cars, Trump said – an echo of “The Jetsons,” the classic cartoon about a family in a high-tech future society. Work to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles is already underway by major airlines, auto manufacturers and other companies, though widely seen as years away from reaching the market.  “I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility,” Trump, who announced his third bid for the presidency in November, said in a four-minute video detailing his plan.   He said he would launch a contest to charter up to 10 “freedom cities” roughly the size of Washington, DC, on undeveloped federal land.   “We’ll actually build new cities in our country again,” Trump said in the video. “These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American dream.”Light on detailsTrump’s pitch comes the day before he is set to address the Conservative Political Action Conference in the Washington, DC, area, and as the 2024 Republican presidential field begins to take shape.   The proposal is the latest in a series of early policy offerings from Trump, who in recent weeks has also said he would seek to ramp up domestic energy production, adopt a more isolationist foreign policy stance and purge the government and military of “warmongers and globalists,” and undo a Biden executive order that would require government agencies to submit annual public plans aimed at promoting equity.

Trump did not elaborate Friday on how he would pay for his latest proposal – leaving unanswered what could be the biggest question as Republicans in Washington seek to curb federal spending. He also did not explain how some elements of his proposal differ from similar Democratic plans.  His plan, which was light on details, includes three additional planks: increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States; providing families with “baby bonuses” that he said would “help launch a new baby boom”; and launching a beautification effort aimed at removing “ugly” buildings and revitalizing parks and public spaces.   Trump did not explain what “baby bonuses” would amount to or who would qualify. It’s not clear how his proposal differs from the enhanced child tax credit, which wasn’t extended beyond 2021. A group of Democratic lawmakers and progressive advocates tried – but failed – to have it included in the $1.7 trillion spending measure in December. That proposal was blocked by Republicans. Trade battleTrump on Friday also called for universal tariffs and imposing higher taxes on imported goods. He said he would escalate a trade battle with China, which he began during his four years in the White House. Doing so, he said, would jump-start American manufacturing.   President Joe Biden has left tariffs in place on $350 billion of Chinese goods – nearly two-thirds of what the US imports from China – which were imposed by Trump.   However, the costs of those tariffs are being passed on to American consumers, and contributing to inflation, experts say.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last year that those tariffs on Chinese goods have “imposed more harm on consumers and businesses” than on China.

There’s no money left in Uncle Sam’s till to pay for big dreams and daring projects.”  The nation is in the midst of a “cost-of-living crisis” that makes this too expensive of a proposition, Rupkey added.

Nikki Haley speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, DC, on March 3, 2023.Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesCNN      Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley in an address before key GOP donors Saturday took aim at her own political party for enabling what she describes as excessive government spending, according to a copy of her speech obtained by CNN.   At a private retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, hosted by the conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth, Haley was expected to take a shot at former President Donald Trump, who was not invited to the event and was instead to headline the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, DC, on Saturday.   “I know there’s a Republican candidate out there who you did not invite to this conference,” reads the speech by Haley, who has been reluctant to attack Trump directly since launching her 2024 presidential campaign last month. “I appreciate being one you did invite.”  Former South Carolina Gov. and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley arrives for an event launching her candidacy for the US presidency February 15, 2023 in Charleston, South Carolina.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesNikki Haley's first days in GOP 2024 race preview the Trump balancing act awaiting other contendersTrump was the only major 2024 hopeful not invited to the Club for Growth event. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is moving toward launching his own presidential bid, spoke at the retreat on Thursday. Haley spoke at both the Club for Growth retreat and CPAC, which this year featured key allies of Trump and several of his family members. After Haley spoke at CPAC on Friday, she was heckled by several Trump supporters, who chanted, “We love Trump!” as she posed for photos with attendees.   Haley’s speech in Florida on Saturday did not name any Republican politicians, but the former UN ambassador and twice-elected former South Carolina governor was expected to call out the group of 158 House Republicans who she said had “voted to keep this ‘gateway drug’ of wasteful spending” in the form of earmarks.   “Isn’t the Club for Growth known for supporting primary challenges to squishy Republicans? If Republicans don’t stand for fiscal sanity and economic freedom, no one will,” Haley was expected to say, adding, “I’m not afraid to call out my fellow Republicans.”  Haley’s speech criticized Democrats, including President Joe Biden, whom she accused of pushing “socialist” policies and “wasting taxpayer money,” echoing her campaign trail rhetoric since launching her bid. But her address also panned some Republicans, who she said were just as much to blame for the spending.   “Obviously, the socialist left hates economic freedom. But so do some of our fellow Republicans,” the presidential candidate was expected to say. “They bad-mouth capitalism almost as much as Elizabeth Warren. You’ll never hear that from me.  “It’s insane that Joe Biden has gotten a free pass for this socialist spending spree. But a big part of the reason is that Republicans haven’t held the line – or even upheld the conservative market principles they claim to support.”  Haley’s focus on government spending came the day after Trump released a plan calling for significant new federal investments, including building up to 10 new “Freedom Cities” on unused federal land and asking Congress to provide “baby bonuses” to help young parents raise their children. Trump also called for investing in the development of flying cars, saying, “I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility.”  This story and headline have been updated with additional information.

President Joe Biden speaks as he meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Friday, March 3, 2023. Susan Walsh/APCNN      A year ago, when German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last visited Washington, Russian forces had yet to cross the border into Ukraine and skepticism abounded at the dire warnings from the White House that an invasion was imminent.  Scholz returned Friday for meetings with President Joe Biden after a transformative 12 months that required Europe to dramatically rethink its own security and Germany to undergo its most significant shift in military and energy policy in decades.  “There’s been a lot of change since the last time you were here,” Biden said at the start of the Oval Office talks, which were expected to last about an hour.  Scholz concurred: “A lot’s happened since last year, we’ve got a lot to talk about,” he said.   Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has turned Scholz, who took office two months before Russia’s invasion, into a crisis leader, overseeing Europe’s largest economy and most powerful democracy during the worst violence on the continent since World War II.  And it has thrust him and Biden into one of the world’s most consequential relationships, sustained by shared opposition to Russia’s invasion but strained at moments over how to respond.  “You stepped up to provide critical military support. And I would argue, beyond the military support, the moral support you’ve given Ukrainians has been profound. Profound,” Biden told his counterpart in the Oval Office.  “I know it’s not been easy,” Biden said. “Very difficult for you.”  White House officials say over the past year, Biden has developed a solid relationship with Scholz, who succeeded longtime chancellor Angela Merkel at the end of 2021. They spoke by phone three times in January alone, and during Friday’s session at the White House they were expected to speak extensively one-on-one in the Oval Office.  The overwhelming topic of discussion was Ukraine, according to senior administration officials, including discussions the two men have each held recently with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is pressuring the West for more powerful weapons as he prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  “The overarching purpose of this meeting was a chance for the two leaders to be able to coordinate specifically on Ukraine,” a senior administration official said ahead of the visit.  They were expected to also touch on recent intelligence suggesting China is considering providing Russia with lethal aid, a step US officials fear could prolong the conflict, though China wasn’t a “driving focus” of the talks.  The White House also announced another round of military assistance for Ukraine on Friday, including ammunition for weapons systems that the Ukrainians already have. The package totaled around $400 million.  In inviting Scholz to the White House again, Biden hoped to fortify a leader who has endured a trying first year in office.  A year ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Germany supplying Ukraine with weapons like Howitzers, Stinger missile launchers and Leopard tanks to stave off Russian invaders. A largely pacifist outlook had dominated Berlin’s foreign policy in the decades following German violence in World War II.  But now, Germany is investing again in its military and sending increasingly advanced weaponry, though not at the pace Zelensky would like. Other critics say Scholz has failed to occupy a unifying role in Europe akin to Merkel, preferring to operate unilaterally instead of in conjunction with fellow leaders like Emmanuel Macron of France. And some US officials say Germany remains overly cautious compared to other Western allies.  Still, the so-called “Zeitenwende,” or turning point, that Scholz called for in the days following Russia’s invasion has been welcomed at the White House and reinforced by many of the steps he’s taken in the months since.  Germany’s decision in January to provide Ukraine with Leopard tanks is the latest example of the country overcoming its post-war hesitancy for foreign military intervention. The decision only came after diplomatic wrangling with the United States, who agreed to provide Ukraine with its own Abrams tanks, despite warnings from the Pentagon they wouldn’t be as useful on the battlefield.  There remains some dispute over how, exactly, the deal came about. After Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last weekend, “the Germans told the president that they would not be prepared to send those Leopards into the fight … until the president also agreed to send Abrams,” the German government insisted the decision to send tanks was arrived at jointly and without any demands from Berlin.  Either way, the result has been viewed positively by Biden’s aides, some of whom took a skeptical view of Scholz a year ago when he appeared reluctant to apply sanctions on Russia should it invade Ukraine or cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Scholz took both of those steps once the invasion began, despite the risk of Germany being cut off from one of its main energy suppliers.   For his part, Scholz could use Friday’s meeting to raise with Biden his ongoing discussions with other European leaders about providing security guarantees for Ukraine as a way to begin the process of negotiating an end to the war.  Fear are growing among US and European officials that the grinding conflict could turn into a bloody stalemate, with each side making only small gains while still refusing to come to the negotiating table.  Speaking to the German parliament before leaving for Washington, Scholz said Thursday that Germany and its Western allies were in talks with Kyiv over future security guarantees in preparation of a sustainable peace for Ukraine.  “Such security guarantees, however, come with the presumption that Ukraine successfully defends itself in this war,” Scholz said, emphasizing that Germany would continue to support Ukraine with weapons supplies.  Scholz went on to say that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was not currently open to negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.   “Is Putin even ready … to negotiate a just peace? Nothing suggests it at the moment,” Scholz said.

From left, Zhu Hexin, He Lifeng, Ding Xuexiang and Li Qiang.AP licensedHong KongCNN      The team of Communist Party officials running China’s economy is about to get a major makeover.  Party elites have just finalized nominations for key government positions ahead of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, which starts on Sunday.   They include the four men tapped to manage the world’s second biggest economy: Li Qiang as premier, Ding Xuexiang as executive vice premier, He Lifeng as vice premier and Zhu Hexin as the new central bank chief.  No women have occupied these key economic positions in Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s administration.  All four are expected to be formally endorsed at the congress. The appointments are seen as part of Xi’s attempt to strengthen the party’s control over the country’s economic institutions, where many Western-educated officials have long influenced policy making.  Chinese leaders and lawmakers attend the annual National People's Congress in Bejing in March 2021. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images/FileUnlike their predecessors, the four men, who are either close associates of Xi or connected to his trusted aides, haven’t been educated in the West or are perceived to have little experience dealing with international financial organizations.   Now all eyes are on how they will help shape policy as the Chinese economy navigates a growing array of challenges, including sluggish consumption, rising unemployment, a downturn in the housing market, lack of business confidence, local governments’ debt distress, an ageing population and increasing tension with the United States over technology sanctions.   The congress will set an economic growth target for this year that should be a considerable improvement on last year’s anemic 3%, one of the weakest performances in decades, but which is likely to be a far cry from the pace of expansion China enjoyed before the pandemic. The new team will have to deliver the recovery. Li QiangA former party boss of Shanghai who presided over the city’s chaotic two-month lockdown, Li Qiang was named the country’s No 2 party official after Xi during the leadership reshuffle in October.That puts the 63-year-old in line to succeed Premier Li Keqiang when he steps down during the upcoming congress.  Li Qiang was named the No 2 party official at the Communist Party's 20th congress in October  2022. Koki Kataoka/APIn China’s political system, the premier is traditionally responsible for managing the economy, with several vice premiers supporting his work and taking charge of different issues.   Born in the eastern province of Zhejiang, Li started his career as a worker at an irrigation pumping station. He received his undergraduate education in agricultural mechanization at a college in the city of Ningbo and then worked his way up through the provincial bureaucracy.

Li would be the first premier since the Mao era not to have previously worked at the State Council, China’s cabinet, as vice premier, analysts say.   It was Li’s personal ties with Xi that appear to have clinched his promotion over more qualified candidates, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said when Li was promoted last year.   But some analysts said his tenure in Shanghai, particularly before last year’s Covid lockdown, pointed to a pragmatic, pro-business style.  During Li’s time there, Tesla built its first gigafactory outside the United States in the city. Tesla has sole ownership of that factory, the first foreign automaker in China to wholly own its plant.  “China’s business environment should turn more friendly, at least, in the coming two years” under Li, who is likely to support private companies and foreign investors, Citi analysts said in a research report.   In 2019, Li also oversaw the launch of China’s Nasdaq-style stock market on the Shanghai stock exchange. Ding XuexiangXi’s current chief of staff, Ding Xuexiang, may become the next executive vice premier, Nomura analysts said on Tuesday, citing their observations based on the ranking of the new Politburo Standing Committee.  Ding Xuexiang attends an event to introduce new members of the Politburo Standing Committee at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in October 2022. Ng Han Guan/APThat means the 60-year-old, who has never led a province or had much experience making economic policy, will likely carry overall responsibility for China’s domestic economy, particularly the country’s fiscal policy.    Born in the eastern province of Jiangsu, Ding studied metallurgy at the Northeastern Institute of Heavy Machinery. He began his career at the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials and spent 17 years there, rising from a researcher to deputy party chief.   He later joined the Communist Party’s committee in Shanghai and served as a top aide to Xi when he spent about seven months in the city as party chief in 2007. In 2013, Ding moved to Beijing as Xi’s personal secretary after Xi’s promotion to the country’s top job. He LifengMoreover, He Lifeng, who runs China’s powerful National Development and Reform Commission, may be appointed as the next vice premier in charge of economic, financial and industrial affairs, Nomura analysts said.   He Lifeng addresses a press conference in Beijing in March 2019. Stringer/ICHPL Imaginechina/AP/FileThe 68-year-old would succeed Vice Premier Liu He, who led China’s negotiations with the United States during trade talks in 2018 and 2019. Liu is a Harvard-trained economist who has been called  “a bridge between the East and West” by analysts.  He Lifeng, who received his undergraduate degree in finance from Xiamen University, has never studied overseas.  He is known for overseeing the construction of a massive state-led investment project billed as “China’s Manhattan” in Tianjin, when he served as the city’s senior official after the global financial crisis of 2008. The project has left a legacy of empty buildings, deserted skyscrapers and huge debt for the local government. Zhu HexinAnother key role to be confirmed during the congress is the governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), responsible for China’s monetary policy and overseeing the financial system.  Zhu Hexin speaks at the Sina China Banking Development Forum in Beijing in July 2015. Wei yao/ICHPL Imaginechina/APZhu Hexin, chairman of China’s state-owned financial conglomerate Citic Group, is the leading candidate to succeed US-educated economist Yi Gang as central bank governor, according to the Wall Street Journal.Zhu, 55, has spent most of his career working at the Bank of Communications in the wealthy eastern province of Jiangsu. He also had a stint in Sichuan province, in the southwest, as the deputy governor between 2016 and 2018.  After that, he worked at the PBOC as a deputy governor for two years, before being transferred to Citic Group in 2022.   Unlike Yi, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois, Zhu has little overseas experience.  Meanwhile, He Lifeng may serve a concurrent role as the party secretary of the PBOC, which could increase political backing for the bank, but also erode its authority, the WSJ reported, citing unnamed sources.  Currently, Guo Shuqing, who heads China’s banking and insurance regulator, serves a concurrent post as the party chief of the PBOC. Guo has also received some training in the West, attending Oxford University as a visiting scholar in the 1980s.  Xi’s selection of top roles represents a leadership style that “prioritizes personal loyalties over competence and productive discourse,” Sonja Opper, a professor at Bocconi University, previously told CNN in an interview.  “The risk is that China’s leadership becomes isolated and loses sight of alternative, possibly better ways to approach the many challenges the country faces,” she said.

The remarks from the billionaire — who called for an end to Moscow’s war in Ukraine in the early days of the conflict last year — contrast with a more upbeat assessment of Russia’s economic fortunes by President Vladimir Putin last week. Putin praised the resilience of the country’s economy in the face of unprecedented Western sanctions imposed in the past year.   Russia’s economic output shrank 2.1% last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the government. The contraction was more limited than many economists initially predicted.   A mysterious fleet is helping Russia ship oil around the world. And it's growingBut cracks are starting to show — Russia is cutting oil production this month — and Western sanctions could escalate further. Ultimately, Russia’s economic prospects are contingent on what happens in Ukraine.   Foreign investors, especially from “friendly” countries, also have a big role to play, Deripaska said. Whether they will come depends on whether Russia can create the right conditions and make its markets attractive, he was quoted as saying.  In a bid to starve Russia of funds for its aggression, Western countries have announced more than 11,300 sanctions since the February 2022 invasion, and frozen some $300 billion of Russia’s foreign reserves.  But China has thrown the Kremlin an economic lifeline by buying Russian energy, replacing Western suppliers of machinery and base metals among other products, and providing an alternative to the US dollar.     Still, Moscow has a steep hill to climb to replace revenues lost as a result of sanctions, not least from exports. Data released Friday showed that the European Union’s imports from Russia fell by 51% in value between February and December last year. The bloc was one of the main trading partners for Russia before the invasion of Ukraine, with 38% of Russia’s exports going to the European Union in 2020.  The Russian government’s revenue plunged 35% in January compared with a year ago, while expenditures jumped 59%, leading to a budget deficit of about 1,761 billion rubles ($23.3 billion).   Deripaska made his fortune in the aluminum business during the chaotic scramble for assets following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2018, he was sanctioned by the United States, which noted that the oligarch “does not separate himself from the Russian state.” Last year, he was indicted for allegedly violating US sanctions.  Forbes estimates Deripaska’s current net worth at just under $3 billion.  — Anna Chernova contributed reporting.

Video Ad FeedbackZuckerberg critical of Apple and App Store practices    04:04   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      Apple supplier Foxconn says it is seeking Indian partners to cooperate in areas such as chips and electric vehicles, as its chief executive wrapped up a visit to the country.  Taiwan’s Foxconn has been looking to expand its operations in the South Asian giant after suffering severe supply disruptions in China last year. The firm bounced back from the disruptions early this year.   “India is a country with a large population,” Young Liu, the company’s chairman and CEO, said in a Saturday statement. “My trip this week supported Foxconn’s efforts to deepen partnerships … and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles.”  “Foxconn will continue to communicate with local governments to seek the most beneficial development opportunities for the company and all stakeholders,” he added.  The company, best known for making Apple    (AAPL)’s iPhones, is one of the world’s biggest contract makers of electronics. It’s now expanding into other areas including electric vehicles.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)Jeff Chiu/APIs the iPhone's 'Made in India' era about to begin?Liu did not specify any investment spending in India during his trip, which included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  The company already has factories in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  On Friday, the investment promotion office of the southern Indian state of Karnataka said Foxconn had announced a major deal there and that 300 acres of land had been allocated for a facility. The investment will generate 100,000 jobs over 10 years in the state, it said.  According to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources, the company plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, to make iPhone parts.  India has emerged as an attractive potential alternative to China for the likes of Apple. One of India’s top ministers, Piyush Goyal, said in January that Apple wants to ramp up its production in the South Asian country to a quarter of its overall total from between 5% and 7% now.  For years, Apple had relied on a vast manufacturing network in China to mass produce iPhones, iPads and other popular products. But its dependence on the country was tested last year by Beijing’s strict zero-Covid strategy, which was rapidly dismantled last December.  Apple devices are currently manufactured in India by Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, which are all Taiwanese companies.  – CNN’s Diksha Madhok contributed reporting RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Pickleball is America’s fastest-growing sport.

Some experts say the country has hit its worst point since a 1990s famine known as the “Arduous March” caused mass starvation and killed hundreds of thousands of people, or an estimated 3-5% of what was then a 20 million-strong population.  Trade data, satellite images and assessments by the United Nations and South Korean authorities all suggest the food supply has now “dipped below the amount needed to satisfy minimum human needs,” according to Lucas Rengifo-Keller, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  Even if food was distributed equally – something close to inconceivable in North Korea where the elite and military take priority – Rengifo-Keller said “you would have hunger-related deaths.”  South Korean officials agree with that assessment, with Seoul announcing recently that it believes deaths from starvation are occurring in some areas of the country. Though producing solid evidence to back up those claims is made difficult by the country’s isolation, few experts doubt its assessment.   Even before the Covid pandemic, nearly half of the North Korean population was undernourished, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.   Three years of closed borders and isolation can only have made matters worse.  In a sign of just how desperate the situation has become, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a four-day Workers’ Party meeting this week to discuss a revamp of the country’s agricultural sector, calling for a “fundamental transformation” in farming and state economic plans and a need to strengthen state control of farming.  North Korean trucks loaded with sacks of maize wait for clearance at the Chinese border in 1997, during the famine period known as the ""Arduous March.""Anu Nousiainen/AFP/Getty Images/FILEBut various experts say Pyongyang has only itself to blame for the problems. During the pandemic, Pyongyang ramped up its isolationist tendencies, erecting a second layer of fencing along 300 kilometers of its border with China and squeezing what little cross border trade it had access to.  And in the past year it has spent precious resources carrying out a record number of missile tests.  “There’s been shoot on sight orders (at the border) that were put in place in August 2020 … a blockade on travel and trade, which has included what very limited official trade (there was before),” said Lina Yoon, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.  During 2022, China officially exported nearly 56 million kilograms of wheat or maslin flour and 53,280 kg of cereals in grain/flakes form to North Korea, according to Chinese customs data.  But Pyongyang’s clampdown has strangled off unofficial trade, which as Yoon points out is “one of the main lifelines of the markets inside North Korea where ordinary North Koreans buy products.”   Cases in which people smuggle Chinese products into the country, with a bribe to a border guard to look the other way, have been next to non-existent since the borders closed.  Various experts say the root problem is years of economic mismanagement and that Kim’s efforts to ramp up state control further will only make things worse.  “The North Korean borders need to open and they need to restart trade and they need to bring these things in for agriculture to improve and they need food to feed the people. But right now they are prioritizing isolation, they are prioritizing repression,” Yoon said.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addresses the Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang, North Korea, on February 26, 2023.KCNA/ReutersBut as Rengifo-Keller pointed out, it is not in Kim’s interest to allow the unofficial trade of the past to re-emerge in this dynastically ruled country. “The regime does not want a flourishing entrepreneurial class that can threaten its power.”  Then there are the missile tests Kim remains obsessed with and his constant refusals of offers of aid from his neighbor.  South Korea’s Foreign Minister Park Jin told CNN in an interview last week that “the only way that North Korea can get out of this trouble is to come back to the dialogue table and accept our humanitarian offer to the North and make a better choice for the future.”   Prime Minister Han Duck-soo told CNN Thursday said the situation “is worsening, our intelligence shows, because it’s clear that their policies are changing… the chairman (Kim Jong Un) would like to put a lot of pressure to make it state dictated, you know, supply of food to their people, which will not function.”  Seoul’s Ministry of Unification was quick to point out Pyongyang continues to focus on its missile and nuclear program rather than feeding its own people.    A visitor looks over the border between South and North Korea from the Unification Observation Post in Paju, South Korea.Ahn Young-joon/APIn a briefing last month, vice spokesperson Lee Hyo-jung said, “according to local and international research institutions, if North Korea had used the expense of the missiles it launched last year on food supplies, it would have been enough to purchase over one million tons of food, believed to be more than enough to cover North Korea’s annual food shortage.”  Seoul’s rural development agency believes North Korea’s crop production last year was 4% lower than the year before, suffering flooding and adverse weather.   Rengifo-Keller fears the culmination of these effects coupled with the regime’s “misguided approach to economic policy” could have a disastrous impact on the already suffering population.   “This is a chronically malnourished population for decades, high rates of stunting and all signals point to a deteriorating situation, so it certainly wouldn’t take much to push the country into famine.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

About 35 million people across parts of the South and Southern Plains are at risk Thursday for severe thunderstorms – the worst of which could bring multiple rounds of ferocious winds, large hail and tornadoes, the Storm Prediction Center said.   A tornado destroying a home, a tornado above a man's home and a third tornado to the left in Bondurant, IA.Jon Bixler/Facebook4 tornado safety tips that could save your life“Thursday and Thursday night: An intensifying system is expected to produce significant severe storms and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding,” the National Weather Service warned. “Think now about what (to) do during a warning wherever you expect to be.”  The Storm Prediction Center on Thursday evening listed several tornado reports in Texas and one in Louisiana as of 7:40 p.m. CT.  In Shreveport, Louisiana, David Langston was inside a dry cleaning store when a tornado hit, he told CNN affiliate KSLA.   “The wind started picking up, and this lady said, ‘My babies are in the car,’” Langston told the station. “And she wanted me to help her, and I said, ‘Let’s go.’ But then all of a sudden, the wind got so bad that I said, ‘No ma’am, don’t go out.’ “  Her car was underneath a sign. If we had gone out there, I mean, we would have been hit by that sign.”  Langston said they rescued the two young children, unharmed, after the winds died down. “It just came up, and 20 seconds later it was gone,” he said. “And I mean, total chaos. Glass breaking out everywhere.”  A tornado watch issued Thursday evening for parts of southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana was set to run until midnight.   A Level 4 of 5 moderate threat of severe storms is in place for over 8 million people in eastern Texas, northern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. Those areas include Dallas; Fort Worth, Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana.  Storms coincided with power outages in Texas. More than 320,000 homes and businesses in Texas were without power as of 9:15 p.m. CT, according to utility tracker PowerOutage.us.  The Dallas-Fort Worth area Thursday afternoon also was put under a tornado watch that was scheduled to last until 10 p.m. CT. A line of severe storms moving through Texas brought several wind gusts in the 60 to 80 mph range across the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.  In the Dallas suburb of McKinney, people were injured when four tractor-trailers in the same stretch of highway were blown over. McKinney police didn’t specify how many people were hurt.   A strong storm seen at Dallas-Fort Worth airport on March 3, 2023.@jonaslen/InstagramBecause of thunderstorms, a ground stop was in effect Thursday night for the airports in Austin and San Antonio, meaning planes destined for Dallas are to be held at their airports of origin, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Earlier, there was a ground stop for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.   Memphis, Tennessee; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Waco, Texas, face a Level 3 of 5 severe storm risk. Cities with a Level 2 of 5 risk include Houston; Austin, Texas; and Jackson, Mississippi.  In Miller County, Arkansas, two people were unhurt despite being trapped in a house that collapsed during the storms, according to Michael Godfrey, the director of the county emergency management office.  Debris flies through the air near the Tarrant County Courthouse in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, on March 2, 2023. Tom Fox/APTorrential rainfall in the system is also a concern. Rain could fall as quickly as 2 inches per hour in the strongest storms, leading to flash flooding.   More than 24 million people are under flood watches from Oklahoma to Ohio. Up to 5 inches of rain is forecast across the region, and isolated totals could exceed 8 inches.  The severe weather threat will shift Friday to the Southeast and Ohio Valley on Friday, with Charlotte, Nashville, Atlanta and Louisville at risk.  And the same storm system is expected to bring heavy snow and ice to the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions by this weekend. Mammoth snowfall in the WestThis lengthy winter storm already has wreaked havoc in the West, with snow in New Mexico due to continue through Thursday afternoon. Up to 5 inches is possible in lower elevations, while 8 to 18 inches could fall across high elevations.

In Southern California, massive amounts of snow this week left some stranded and made roads impassable for days. Several areas across the state saw more than 100 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.   The California Department of Transportation said they have so far removed over 7 million cubic yards of snow – enough to fill 2232 Olympic size swimming pools.  Across the state, about 52,000 homes and businesses still had no power Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us.  Across California, several days of heavy snow knocked out power to thousands, made roads impassable and trapped residents in their homes.   The California National Guard will arrive in the San Bernardino mountains on Thursday to help dig out snowbound communities, according to the state Office of Emergency Services (CalOES). Nearly 100 inches of snow have fallen on the Lake Arrowhead and Crestline communities in recent days.   Aerial footage from CNN affiliate shows neighborhoods with indiscernible streets, homes with snow reaching second-story windows, and a local supermarket with its roof caved in due to the heavy snow.  Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a state of emergency for 13 counties, including San Bernardino County, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties.  Robert Hallmark, who says that this is the worst snowstorm of his 31 years living here, clears snow at his home as residents throughout the San Bernardino Mountains continue to be trapped in their homes by snow on March 1, 2023 in Running Springs, California.

David McNew/Getty ImagesCalifornia declares state of emergency in 13 counties after brutal winter storm traps residentsMount Baldy, outside Los Angeles, has recorded 106 inches of snow since February 22. More than a quarter of all that snowfall came down in two days this week.    Huntington Lake in the Sierra Mountains was lashed with 144 inches of snow over a six-day period this week, according to the Fresno County Office of Emergency Services. The office also reported 10 to 12 feet of snow near China Peak, which led to the closure of Highway 16.  While California gets a brief reprieve from the snow for the rest of this week, another system is expected to move into Northern California this weekend.

The one billion pieces of data were collected for purposes including Covid tests, contact tracing and the prevention of imported cases – and they were only the first batch of such data to be disposed, the statement said.  China collects vast amounts of data on its citizens – from gathering their DNA and other biological samples to tracking their movements on a sprawling network of surveillance cameras and monitoring their digital footprints.  But since the pandemic, state surveillance has pushed deeper into the private lives of Chinese citizens, resulting in unprecedented levels of data collection. Following the dismantling of zero-Covid restrictions, residents have grown concerned over the security of the huge amount of personal data stored by local governments, fearing potential data leaks or theft.   Last July, it was revealed that a massive online database apparently containing the personal information of up to one billion Chinese citizens was left unsecured and publicly accessible for more than a year – until an anonymous user in a hack forum offered to sell the data and brought it to wider attention.   In the statement, Wuxi officials said “third-party audit and notary officers” would be invited to take part in the deletion process, to ensure it cannot be restored. CNN cannot independently verify the destruction of the data.  Wuxi also scrapped more than 40 local apps used for “digital epidemic prevention,” according to the statement.  During the pandemic, Covid apps like these dictated social and economic life across China, controlling whether people could leave their homes, where they could travel, when businesses could open and where goods could be transported.  But following the country’s abrupt exit from zero-Covid in December, most of these apps faded from daily life.   On December 12, China scrapped a nationwide mobile tracking app that collected data on users’ travel movements. But many local pandemic apps run by the municipal or provincial governments, such as the ubiquitous Covid health code apps, have remained in place – although they are no longer in use.  Adobe StockNearly one billion people in China had their personal data leaked, and it's been online for more than a year Wuxi claims to be the first municipality in China to have destroyed Covid-related personal data from citizens. On Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform, users called for other local governments to follow suit.  Yan Chunshui, deputy head of Wuxi’s big data management bureau, said the disposal was meant to better protect citizens’ privacy, prevent data leaks and free up data storage space.  Kendra Schaefer, the head of tech policy research at the Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China, said the data collection related to local-level Covid apps was often messy, and those apps were difficult and expensive to manage for local governments.  “Considering the cost and difficulty managing such apps, coupled with concerns expressed by the public over data security and privacy – not to mention the political win local governments get by symbolically putting zero-Covid to bed – dismantling those systems is par for the course,” Schaefer said.  In many cases, she added, the big data departments at local governments were overwhelmed dealing with Covid data, so scaling back simply makes sense economically.   “Many cities have not yet deleted their Covid data – or have not done so publicly – not because I believe they intend to keep it, but because it simply hasn’t been that long since zero-Covid was halted,” Schaefer said.

Companies listed in the S&P 500 index beat analysts’ earnings estimates by an average of just 1.3% last quarter. For context, that’s way down on the index’s 5-year average of 8.6%, according to FactSet data. What’s happening: There have been some steep and disappointing profit misses as corporate America feels the sting of sticky inflation and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.  Tech companies fared poorly this season: Apple    (AAPL) recorded a rare earnings miss while Intel    (INTC) and Google-parent company Alphabet also fell short of expectations.   But it wasn’t all doom-and-gloom. Energy companies brought in yet another quarter of record profits, with Big Oil companies — such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell — notching their most profitable years in history. Elsewhere, Tesla    (TSLA) reported record revenue gains and beat earnings expectations. Big box retailers Target    (TGT) and Walmart    (WMT) also surpassed estimates as US consumers kept on spending.   Here’s what else traders need to know about the final few months of last year and beyond.  Corporate profits could drop for the first time since 2020S&P 500 companies are on track to report a 4.6% drop in earnings year-over-year, according to FactSet data. That would mark their first earnings decline since the third quarter of 2020, when Covid shut down large swaths of the economy.   Gloomy forecasts aboundAbout 81 S&P 500 companies have issued negative earnings-per-share guidance for the first quarter of 2023, according to FactSet. That’s a lot higher than the 23 companies reporting positive guidance.    There was no shortage of foreboding forecasts from top execs on earnings calls this season.   Walmart beat estimates last quarter, but they also lowered expectations for future earnings.   Home Depot    (HD) CEO Ted Decker said he was concerned that consumers were becoming less resilient to the economy. “We noted some deceleration in certain products and categories, which was more pronounced in the fourth quarter,” he said on an analyst call.   Lowe’s executives, meanwhile, warned that they were preparing for a “more cautious consumer” this year.   Investors feel like celebratingWall Street traders appear to be taking this dour earnings season in their stride. The market is “rewarding positive earnings surprises more than average and punishing negative earnings surprises much less than average for the fourth quarter,” reports FactSet.    Inflation is (still) a big deal More than 325 S&P 500 companies have cited the term “inflation” during their earnings calls for the fourth quarter. That’s well above the 10-year average of 157, according to FactSet document searches.   But the worries over price hikes appear to be waning, at least a little bit. This marks the lowest number of S&P 500 companies using the “I”-word on their calls since the third quarter of 2021. Since last quarter, the number of inflation mentions has fallen by about 20%. The service economy, labor and China: What investors are watching▸ ISM Services PMI — a report that measures the strength of the US service sector — is due out at 10 a.m. ET. The data is expected to show a slight slowdown in growth between January and February (54.5 in February vs. 56.5 in January. For context, a reading above 50 means the services economy is expanding).   That deceleration would be a big deal. It would signal that the economy is beginning to cool and that the Fed’s efforts to fight inflation by raising interest rates are working. If services sector growth accelerates, however, it could signal that more aggressive rate hikes are ahead and send markets lower.  ▸ Wall Street is anticipating (or dreading, depending on who you ask) next Friday’s unemployment report. The February data is expected to shed some light on a shockingly resilient labor market.   Another unexpected surge in non-farm payrolls, like the 517,000 new jobs added in January, could indicate more Fed rate hikes are ahead. That could roil markets in this “good news is bad news” environment.   Analysts expect that the economy added 200,000 new jobs last month, according to Refinitiv data.   ▸ The Chinese economy surprised investors this week by quickly bouncing back from its zero-Covid shutdowns. China’s first consumer price index, producer price index and trade figures of 2023 are set to be released next week, which will show the full extent of the country’s rebound.   “These numbers will offer the first official indications of mainland China’s reopening effect following the rebound seen in PMI numbers,” wrote analysts at S&P Global.   Global manufacturing rose in February for the first time in seven months, according to the latest PMI surveys compiled by S&P Global. That growth was largely spurred on by China’s reopening. Another crypto mess Shares of Silvergate Capital, a large lender to cryptocurrency firms, plunged nearly 60% — a record drop —  on Thursday after the company told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it won’t be able to file its annual report on time and cited concerns about its ability to remain in business.   The majority of Silvergate’s crypto clients, including Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital and Crypto.com, quickly cut ties with the bank amid the chaos.   So what does it all mean?   My colleague Allison Morrow explains: The California-based lender reported a $1 billion loss for the fourth quarter as investors panicked over the collapse of FTX, the exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried that is now at the center of a massive federal fraud investigation.  FTX’s collapse in November rippled through the digital asset sector, forcing several firms to halt operations and even declare bankruptcy as liquidity dried up and investors fled.  But unlike FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager and other crypto companies that folded last year, Silvergate is a traditional, federally insured lender that has positioned itself as a gateway to the crypto sector.  It’s among the first major instances of crypto’s volatility spilling into the mainstream banking system — a scenario regulators and crypto skeptics have long feared.

Players of Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers line up during a press conference on September 26, 2020, in Urumqi, China.VCG/Getty Images/FILECNN      The return of China’s top basketball league to its normal season format following years of Covid disruptions has been marred in controversy after an abrupt no-show from one of its former championship-winning teams amid accusations of mistreatment by its star player.  The squabble has sparked a headache for Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) boss – and former NBA star – Yao Ming and is the latest public spat to engulf a major league.  The Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers on Tuesday announced its withdrawal from the CBA after the league slapped it with a one-year suspension from acquiring and registering new players.   Guanghui, which is based in China’s western Xinjiang region, was slated to join other teams on Wednesday for the first matches after a mid-season break.  But in a tersely-worded a statement this week the team accused the league of being “full of chaos” and publicly rebuked Yao’s leadership.   At the heart of the fallout between Guanghui and the league is China national team star Zhou Qi, who is himself now publicly feuding with his own team.  Following an internal investigation, the CBA deemed Guanghui to have committed “registration violations” in the signing of Zhou in February.   This included transferring business operations without formal approval, and not being in accordance with the league’s hiring and salary regulations over the last three seasons.  Yao Ming, China's best known basketball star, at the Sydney Superdome on September 30, 2022Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images/FILEThe result of that investigation has since ignited a full-blown rift between Zhou and his team.  Most explosive are his accusations of bullying by team manager Guo Jian and club president Hou Wei, who according to Zhou went back on their word and hindered him from participating in NBA events in the US.   He provided photos and screenshots of documents supposedly backing up all of his claims.  “The two chairmans, Guo Jian and Hou Wei, and the management, have bullied me and lied to me for many years. I couldn’t bear it. I still couldn’t decide my own future as an adult in 2023,” Zhou wrote in a lengthy post on Chinese social media platform Weibo.  CNN has reached out to the team for comment.  Zhou has long been touted as Yao’s successor as a generational talent given his towering seven-foot-one (216 centimeters) height and previous experience playing with NBA team Houston Rockets — the same team that Yao was drafted to in 2002.  This would have been Zhou’s third stint with the Flying Tigers, having played between 2014-2017 and 2019-2021.  The saga has sparked heavy interest on China’s social media, where fans have flocked to discuss how Yao would react to the scandal and theories on who is ultimately to blame.  “There are no winners from this” and “the biggest victims are the fans” were among the most-liked comments. More angry users have rounded on Yao and described the furore as a “nuclear explosion in the basketball world”.  CNN has reached out to the CBA for comment.  Zhou Qi, seen here playing for China on July 20, 2022, in Jakarta, has been publicly feuding with his league team.Robertus Pudyanto/Getty Images/FILEBasketball commands a huge following in China primarily thanks to Yao’s Hall of Fame career in the NBA.  NBA viewership last year nearly returned to the levels seen before Chinese broadcasters’ 16-month blackout in 2019, according to Reuters. That is an estimated 500 to 800 million viewers through the season.  The CBA, though comparatively less popular, did see pre-Covid audience increases since Yao took charge in 2017.  In its statement Guanghui argues that the CBA “made serious mistakes in its unreasonable and absurd ‘punishment’”.  “After careful consideration, (Guanghui) has solemnly decided to: stop playing this season; and quit the CBA,” it said.  The team then took aim at Yao and the CBA of mismanagement, and Zhou for allegedly repeatedly discrediting the team.  “Since 2017, Yao Ming has held the position of both chairman of the Association and the League. The management of each are intertwined and confused, and the basketball industry is full of chaos,” Guanghui said.  Even after retirement Yao has remained one of China’s most recognisable international faces, acting as a prominent ambassador for sports and fronting a number of charitable causes including campaigns against the ivory trade and consuming shark fins.  Commenting on the Flying Tiger’s withdrawal, Yao told the state-run China National Radio on Wednesday that the Xinjiang club had made “huge contributions” to Chinese basketball in the past 20 years.  “We respect its decision and express regret,” Yao said. “Our top priority now is to bring the league and the games back to the fans.”  Zhou also responded to Guanhui’s broadside with in a lengthy statement of his own on Weibo, calling the revelations “fake news.”  “I admire the ‘creativity’ of (Guanghui) regarding the violations. Sadly, it has been unable to turn around on its road of deception. It’s gone further downhill”.   He concluded that the CBA’s penalty on Xinjiang “is fair and objective”.  Xinjiang, alongside then-All Star Zhou, won their first and only CBA Championship in 2017.  Guanghui’s withdrawal comes one week after soccer team Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard FC withdrew from China’s League One division after dissolving.   The next most popular sport after basketball, Chinese soccer is reeling from its own post-Covid financial difficulties as well as a crackdown on corruption at the highest administrative levels.  A total of six clubs from its marquee Chinese Super League withdrew – and folded – during the pandemic, with dozens more across all divisions.   Many of those who remain are struggling to pay the salaries of players and staff – some even filing appeals to world governing body FIFA.  Meanwhile, a former national team head coach, former national team director, and former Chinese Football Association secretary-general are under investigation by China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection for suspected “serious violations of party discipline and the law”.

US adds Chinese genetics firms to trade blacklist over surveillance allegations    			By Philip Wang and Kathleen Magramo, CNN		  Published  11:06 PM EST, Thu March 2, 2023    Link Copied!   The US Department of Commerce oversees export controls.Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images/FileAtlanta/Hong KongCNN      The United States on Thursday added two subsidiaries of Chinese genetics company BGI to a trade blacklist over allegations it conducted genetic analysis and surveillance activities for Beijing, which Washington says was used to repress ethnic minorities in China.  The US Department of Commerce, which oversees export controls, said in a statement that BGI Research and BGI Tech Solutions (Hongkong) “present a significant risk of diversion to China’s military programs.”  FILE - Residents watch a convoy of security personnel armed with batons and shields patrol through central Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region, Nov. 5, 2017. China's discriminatory detention of Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the western region of Xinjiang may constitute crimes against humanity, the U.N. human rights office said in a long-awaited report Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022, which cited ""serious"" rights violations and patterns of torture in recent years. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)Ng Han Guan/APUN report on China's Uyghurs: What you need to know“The addition of these entities is based upon information that indicates their collection and analysis of genetic data poses a significant risk of contributing to monitoring and surveillance by the government of China, which has been utilized in the repression of ethnic minorities in China,” the statement said.  CNN has reached out to BGI Group, which is one of the world’s largest genomics companies and a listed firm based in Shenzhen, for comment on its subsidiaries.  In 2020, the US Department of Commerce added two other BGI affiliates, Xinjiang Silk Road BGI and Beijing Liuhe BGI, to the trade blacklist over their alleged involvement in human right abuses against Uyghur and other mainly Muslim minorities in China’s far western region of Xinjiang.   BGI Group issued a statement at the time denying the allegations, saying it “does not engage in unethical practices and does not provide gene technology for the surveillance of Uighurs.”  Rights groups have documented human rights abuses in Xinjiang since the 2000s, including forced labor and coercive enforcement of family planning and birth control policies on Uyghur minorities, according to a damning United Nations report last year. China has regularly pushed back against these reports with firm denials.  The latest list compiled by the US Department of Commerce includes a total of 28 Chinese entities, four from Pakistan, three from Myanmar and one each from Belarus, Russia and Taiwan.  Being placed on the list means the entities are restricted from buying American technology and other goods.

Sign up here.Hong KongCNN      The US Department of Energy’s assessment that Covid-19 most likely emerged due to a laboratory accident in China has reignited fierce debate and attention on the question of how the pandemic began.  But the “low confidence” determination, made in a newly updated classified report, has raised more questions than answers, as the department has publicly provided no new evidence to back the claim. It’s also generated fierce pushback from China.  “We urge the US to respect science and facts, stop politicizing this issue, stop its intelligence-led, politics-driven origins-tracing,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.  The Department of Energy assessment is part of a broader US effort in which intelligence agencies were asked by President Joe Biden in 2021 to examine the origins of the coronavirus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.   That overall assessment from the intelligence community was inconclusive, and then, as now, there has yet to be a decisive link established between the virus and a specific animal or other route – as China continues to stonewall international investigations into the origins of the virus.  Four agencies and the National Intelligence Council assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans through natural exposure, while one assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory-related accident. Three other intelligence community elements were unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, according to a declassified version of the 2021 report.  The majority of agencies remain undecided or lean toward the virus having a natural origin – a hypothesis also widely favored by scientists with expertize in the field. But the change from the US Department of Energy has now deepened the split in the intelligence community, especially as the director of the FBI this week commented publicly for the first time on his agency’s similar determination made with “medium confidence.”  Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means the information obtained is not reliable enough, or is too fragmented to make a more definitive judgment.  And while the assessment and new commentary has pulled the theory back into the spotlight, neither agency has released evidence or information backing their determinations. That raises crucial questions about their basis – and shines the spotlight back on gaping, outstanding unknowns and need for further research.   Video Ad FeedbackHear FBI director remark on Covid lab leak theory    03:33   - Source:CNN    New evidence?Scientists largely believe the virus most likely emerged from a natural spillover from an infected animal to people, as many viruses before it, though they widely acknowledge the need for more research of all options. Many have also questioned the lack of data released to substantiate the latest claim.  Virologist Thea Fischer, who in 2021 traveled to Wuhan as part of a World Health Organization (WHO) origins probe and remains a part of ongoing WHO tracing efforts, said it was “very important” that any new assessments related to the origin of the virus are documented by evidence.   “(These are) strong accusations against a public research laboratory in China and can’t stand alone without substantial evidence,” said Fischer, a professor at the University of Copenhagen.  “Hopefully they will share with the WHO soon so the evidence can be known and assessed by international health experts just as all other evidence concerning the pandemic origin.”  A senior US intelligence official told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the new Department of Energy assessment, that the update to the assessment was conducted in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and in consultation with experts outside government.  Security personnel keep watch outside Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organization (WHO) team tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Wuhan, Hubei province, China February 3, 2021.Thomas Peter/Reuters/FileCovid 'lab leak theory': What we've learnedThe idea that the virus could have emerged from a lab accident became more prominent as a spotlight was turned on coronavirus research being done at local facilities, such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It was further enhanced amid a failure to find a “smoking gun” showing which animal could have passed the virus to people at Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market – the location linked to a number of early known cases – amid limitations to follow-up research.  Some experts who have been closely involved in examining existing information, however, are skeptical of the new assessment giving the theory more weight.  “Given that so much of the data we have points to a spillover event occurring at the Huanan market in late 2019 I doubt there’s anything very significant in it or new information that would change our current understanding,” said David Robertson, a professor in the University of Glasgow’s School of Infection and Immunity, who was involved in recent research with findings that supported the natural origin theory.  He noted that locations of early human cases centered on the market, positive environmental samples, and confirmation that live animals susceptible to the virus were for sale there are among evidence supporting the natural origins theory – while there’s no data supporting a lab leak.  “The extent of this evidence continually gets lost (in media discussion) … when in fact we know a lot about what happened, and arguably more than other outbreaks,” he said.

Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images/FILE    China’s responseEfforts to understand how the pandemic started have been further complicated by China’s lack of transparency – especially as the origin question spiraled into another point of bitter contention within rising US-China tensions of recent years.   Beijing has blocked robust, long-term international field investigations and refused to allow a laboratory audit, which could bring clarity, and been reticent to share details and data around domestic research to uncover the cause. However, it repeatedly maintains that it has been transparent and cooperative with the WHO.  Chinese officials carefully controlled the single WHO-backed investigation it did allow on the ground in 2021, citing disease control measures to restrict visiting experts to their hotel rooms for half their trip and to prevent them from sharing meals with their Chinese counterparts – cutting off an opportunity for more informal information sharing.  Citing data protection, Beijing has also declined to allow its own investigatory measures, like testing stored blood samples from Wuhan or combing through hospital data for potential “patient zeros,” to be verified by researchers outside the country.  China has fiercely denied that the virus emerged from a lab accident, and has repeatedly tried to assert it could have arrived in the country for the initial outbreak from elsewhere – including a US laboratory, without offering any evidence supporting the claim.

Kiichiro Sato/AP/FileBlinken's new warning to Beijing is the latest sign of deteriorating US-China relationsBut a top WHO official as recently as last month publicly called for “more cooperation and collaboration with our colleagues in China to advance studies that need to take place in China”– including studies of markets and farms that could have been involved.   “These studies need to be conducted in China and we need cooperation from our colleagues there to advance our understandings,” WHO technical lead for Covid-19 Maria Van Kerkhove said at a media briefing.   When asked about the Department of Energy assessment by CNN, a WHO representative said the organization and its origins tracing advisory body “will keep examining all available scientific evidence that would help us advance the knowledge on the origin of SARS CoV 2 and we call on China and the scientific community to undertake necessary studies in that direction.”  “Until we have more evidence all hypotheses are still on the table,” the representative said.

Japanese islands, viewed from Mt. Shiude in Mitoyo, Kagawa prefecture.Kyodo News/Getty Images/FILECNN      Japan has recounted its islands – and discovered it has 7,000 more than it previously thought.  Digital mapping by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) recently found there to be 14,125 islands in Japanese territory, more than double the figure of 6,852 that has been in official use since a 1987 report by Japan’s Coast Guard.  However, the GSI this week stressed that the new figure reflected advances in surveying technology and the detail of the maps used for the count – it did not change the overall area of land in Japan’s possession.  It said that while there is no international agreement on how to count islands, it had used the same size criterion as the previous survey 35 years ago.  That entailed counting all naturally occurring land areas with a circumference of at least 100 meters (330 feet).   The new number does not include any artificially reclaimed land.   Japan's best islands to visit, from Okinawa to cat sanctuary AoshimaThe islands surrounding Japan have been at the heart of several territorial disputes.   Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a dispute that dates to the end of World War II, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.   Japan also says it has a historical claim to the uninhabited Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which it currently administers, but China has repeatedly challenged that claim.   Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea remain locked in a more than 70-year dispute over the sovereignty of a group of islets known as Dokdo by Seoul and Takeshima by Tokyo in the Sea of Japan, which Korea calls the East Sea.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a Quad ministers' panel at the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi on March 3, 2023. Olivier Douliery/APNew Delhi, IndiaCNN      Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and the support flooding in to Kyiv from countries across the world, sends a powerful message to “would be aggressors everywhere,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday during a panel discussion in New Delhi.  “Part of the reason countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have effect here,” Blinken said, speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitics conference.   “If we allow, with impunity, Russia to do what it’s doing in Ukraine, then that’s a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too,” he added.  The comments came as Blinken met with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia – a grouping known as the “Quad,” or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.The Quad is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s, though it has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China’s reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.  The foreign ministers of the United States, India, Japan and Australia meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit on March 3, 2023 in New Delhi.Secretary Antony BlinkenBlinken added that the challenges faced by people around the world cannot be dealt with by “any one country acting alone.”  “The great power of the Quad is you have four like-minded countries, united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, experiences, different comparative ways to tackle these problems,” he said.  Though he didn’t specify any “would-be aggressors,” he made several veiled references, saying the Quad is working on increasing countries’ maritime domain awareness – meaning greater surveillance on things happening in their waters – and tamping down on illegal fishing.  Top US officials have previously called out China for illegal fishing operations that “plunder the region’s provisions,” and accused Beijing’s “maritime militias” of intimidating and harassing Indo-Pacific countries.

But its threats are driving the group closer togetherChina has established the world’s largest naval force, built heavily-fortified islands in the South China Sea, and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels in the disputed waters – frequently stoking tensions with its neighbors, and prompting promises from the US to stand by its partners in the region.  The Quad ministers reiterated the point in a joint statement on Friday, expressing “serious concern at the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities.”  Though sometimes dubbed by critics as an “Asian NATO,” the Quad is not a formal military alliance – rather, it’s an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.  It does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.  Quad members cooperate across various fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.

Now what's Beijing going to do with it?But security and the goal of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” are key focuses – and the Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China’s influence, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing in recent years.  The strategic location of each of the Quad nations – at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them – has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China “clique” that is emblematic of a “poisonous” Cold War mentality.  The joint statement on Friday also touched on other regional and international issues, such as the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar following the military’s bloody coup two years ago, North Korea’s nuclear threat and increasingly aggressive missile testing, and the war in Ukraine.  The four ministers condemned the war “and the immense human suffering it is causing, and concurred that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,” according to the statement.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indonesia's President Joko Widodo at last year's G20 Leaders Summit in Indonesia. Willy Kurniawan/ReutersNew DelhiCNN      Foreign ministers from the world’s biggest economies convened in New Delhi Thursday in what was seen as a grand test for Indian diplomacy, which ultimately didn’t succeed in reaching a consensus because of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.   In the second high-level ministerial meeting under India’s Group of 20 (G20) presidency this year, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, met his American, Chinese and Russian counterparts, hoping to find enough common ground to deliver a joint statement at the end of the summit.   But amid festering divisions over Moscow’s war, New Delhi was unable to convince the leaders to put their differences aside, with Jaishankar admitting the conflict had struggled to unite the group.   India, the world’s largest democracy with a population of more than 1.3 billion, has been keen to position itself as a leader of emerging and developing nations – often referred to as the Global South – at a time when soaring food and energy prices as a result of the war are hammering consumers already grappling with rising costs and inflation.   Those sentiments were front and center during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opening remarks earlier Thursday, when he spoke of multiples crises the world faces, with less wealthy nations hit especially hard.   “The experience of the last few years, the financial crisis, climate change, the pandemic, terrorism and wars clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said.   “We must also admit that the tragic consequences of this failure are being faced most over by the developing countries,” who he says are most affected by global warming “caused by richer countries”.   Eluding to the war in Ukraine, Modi acknowledged the conflict was causing “deep global divisions.” But he encouraged the foreign ministers to put differences aside during their meeting Thursday.   “We should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can,” he said.   G20 flags in New Delhi on February 28, 2023. Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the summit, according to a State Department official traveling with Blinken.  Blinken and Lavrov spoke for roughly 10 minutes, the same official said.  Russian Ministry of Foreign affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but played down its significance.  “Blinken asked for contact with Lavrov. On the go, as part of the second session of the twenty, Sergey Viktorovich (Lavrov) talked. There were no negotiations, meetings, etc,” she said.  Deep disagreements over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine played out in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru last month as well, when G20 finance chiefs failed to agree on a statement after their meeting.   Both Russia and China declined to sign the joint statement, which criticized Moscow’s invasion. That left India to issue a “chair’s summary and outcome document” in which it summed up the two days of talks and acknowledged disagreements.  Analysts say that throughout the war New Delhi has deftly balanced its ties to Russia and the West, with Modi emerging as a leader who has been courted by all sides.   But as the war enters its second year, and tensions continue to rise, pressure could mount on countries, including India, to take a firmer stand against Russia – putting Modi’s statecraft to the test. India’s balancing actArguably India’s most celebrated event of the year, the G20 summit has been heavily promoted domestically, with sprawling billboards featuring Modi’s face plastered across the country. Roads have been cleaned and buildings freshly painted ahead of the dignitaries’ visit.   Taking place in the “mother of democracies” under Modi’s leadership, his political allies have been keen to push his international credentials, portraying him as a key player in the global order.  Last year’s G20 leaders’ summit in Bali, Indonesia, issued a joint declaration that echoed what Modi had told Russian President Vladimir Putin weeks earlier on the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan.  “Today’s era must not be of war,” it said, prompting media and officials in India to claim India had played a vital role in bridging differences between an isolated Russia and the United States and its allies.   A board decorated with flowers welcomes foreign ministers to New Delhi, India, on February 28, 2023. Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesIndia, analysts say, prides itself on its ability to balance relations. The country, like China, has refused to condemn Moscow’s brutal assault on Ukraine in various United Nations resolutions. Rather than cutting economic ties with the Kremlin, India has undermined Western sanctions by increasing its purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer.  But unlike China, India has grown closer to the West – particularly the US – despite ties with Russia.  New Delhi’s ties with Moscow date back to the Cold War, and the country remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for military equipment – a vital link given India’s ongoing tensions with China at its shared Himalayan border.  The US and India have taken steps in recent months to strengthen their defense partnership, as the two sides attempt to counter the rise of an increasingly assertive China.

So when and if Putin wishes to come to the table to negotiate, he will have no shortage of diplomats hoping to help,” he said.  Still, as Putin’s aggression continues to throw the global economy into chaos, India has signaled an intention to raise the many concerns faced by the global South, including climate challenges and food and energy security, according to Modi’s opening speech earlier Thursday.   “The world looks upon the G20 to ease the challenges of growth, development, economic resilience, disaster resilience, financial stability, transnational crime, corruption, terrorism, and food and energy security,” Modi said.Navigating tensionsWhile Modi’s government appears keen to prioritize domestic challenges, experts say these issues could be sidelined by the tensions between the US, Russia and China, which have increased recently over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.  Speaking to reporters last week, Ramin Toloui, the US assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, said while Secretary of State Antony Blinken would highlight its efforts to address food and energy security issues, he would also “underscore the damage that Russia’s war of aggression has caused.”  Blinken will “encourage all G20 partners to redouble their calls for a just, peaceful, and lasting end to the Kremlin’s war consistent with UN Charter principles,” Toloui said.   At the same time, Russia in a statement Wednesday accused the US and the European Union of “terrorism,” stating it was “set to clearly state Russia’s assessments” of the current food and energy crisis.   “We will draw attention to the destructive barriers that the West is multiplying exponentially to block the export of goods that are of critical importance to the global economy, including energy sources and agricultural products,” Russia said, hinting at the difficulties New Delhi might face during the meeting.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP)Sean Kilpatrick/APG20's criticism of Russia shows the rise of a new Asian power. And it isn't ChinaIndia has “worked very hard not to be boxed into one side or the other,” Markey said. The country could not “afford to alienate Russia or the US and Modi doesn’t want discussion of the war to force any difficult decisions or to distract from other issues, like green, sustainable economic development,” he added.   But with plummeting ties between Washington and Beijing after the US military shot down what it says was a Chinese spy balloon that flew over American territory, New Delhi will have to carefully drive difficult negotiations between conflicting viewpoints.   China maintains the balloon, which US forces downed in February, was a civilian research aircraft accidentally blown off course, and the fallout led Blinken to postpone a planned visit to Beijing.  As differences played out during the ministerial meeting Thursday, analysts say while India will be disappointed at the outcome, they were in a very difficult position to begin with.   “It will be a disappointment for Modi, but not one that cannot be managed,” Markey said. “Nor would it be India’s fault, as it would primarily be a reflection of the underlying differences over which Modi has very little control.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday for the first time since the war in Ukraine began more than a year ago.  The brief contact on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in New Delhi marks a significant moment as high-level engagements between the United States and Russia have become exceedingly rare since the start of the war last February.   Blinken and Lavrov’s meeting comes amid some of the most heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow in decades.  Their conversation took place not only against the backdrop of the ongoing war – and stern warnings to the Chinese about materially supporting Russia’s conflict – but also amid deteriorating bilateral relations. Moscow has suspended its participation in the New START Treaty, the only remaining nuclear arms control agreement between Russia and the US, and it continues to hold American Paul Whelan in what the State Department has deemed as wrongful detention.  Blinken raised those three key issues – the war, New START, and Whelan – in his roughly 10-minute-long engagement with Lavrov, according to a State Department official traveling with the top US diplomat. Blinken was the one to initiate the conversation, the official and Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova both said.  However, the official noted that there aren’t high expectations the meeting will lead to a breakthrough on key issues of tension between the countries.  “I wouldn’t say that coming out of this encounter there was any expectation that things will change in the near term,” the State Department official told the traveling press.‘End this war of aggression’Blinken said he called on Russia to “end this war of aggression” and “engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace.”  “President Zelensky has put forward a 10 point plan for a just and durable peace. The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis,” Blinken said at a press conference later Thursday in Delhi.  “President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there’s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts and I quote ‘the new territorial realities,’ while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.”  The top US diplomat said the message calling on Moscow to cease its war echoed “what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations and what so many G 20 Foreign Ministers said today.”  At the newsconference, Blinken indicated that many of those foreign ministers had also on Thursday raised directly to China their concerns that Beijing will provide lethal assistance to Russia.  Blinken noted that “this is a shared concern” and reiterated that “this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China.”  “And I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions. So I’m not going to detail what they would be. But of course, we have sanctions authorities of various kinds. That would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at,” he said.‘Serious proposal’ to release Paul WhelanBlinken said that in his conversation with Lavrov, he “raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan as I have on many previous occasions.”  “The United States has put forward a serious proposal. Moscow should accept it,” he said.   Whelan, a former US Marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.  In December 2022, the US secured the freedom of another wrongfully detained American, Brittney Griner, in a prisoner swap, but US officials said that Moscow refused to accept the deal to release Whelan as well.   Whelan FamilyUS had 'direct conversations' with Russia on Paul Whelan since Griner's release, State Department saysElizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan’s sister, told CNN following Blinken’s exchange with Lavrov that “of course, we are pleased to see Paul’s case elevated in this manner, and take a great deal of comfort in the fact that the Secretary of State continues to press for a solution to Paul’s wrongful detention.”  David Whelan that the mention of his brother “at such a rare engagement between the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister” was appreciated.   “It reinforces our sense that the White House continues to advocate for Paul, even if we do not always see the activity,” he told CNN.‘Urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision’ on New STARTThe top US diplomat also “urged  Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision and return to implementing the New START treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation.”  Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would stop participating in the key arms control agreement, and signed a law formally suspending participation it in on Tuesday.  “Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries. It’s also what people around the world expect from us as a nuclear powers,” Blinken said.   “I told the foreign minister that, no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and Soviet Union did even at the height of the Cold War,” he added.  The brief sidelines engagement between Blinken and Lavrov was their first face-to-face encounter in more than a year. They last met in person in Geneva last January – just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.   Blinken and Lavrov were both present at several meetings together over the past year, but had not spoken with each other on those occasions.  And as recently as Wednesday, Blinken suggested he would not meet with his Russian counterpart at the meeting in the Indian capital.  “No plans to see either at the G20, although I suspect that we’ll certainly be in group sessions of one kind or another together,” Blinken said at a press conference Wednesday, referencing both Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang.  The two spoke by phone last July for the first time since the start of the war. In that “frank and direct conversation,” Blinken said he “pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.”    CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.

A resident in the San Bernardino Mountains clears snow at his home on Wednesday, March 1, 2023, in Running Springs, California.David McNew/Getty ImagesCNN      Some California residents remain trapped inside their homes after a winter storm dumped feet of snow across the Golden State, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to issue a state of emergency in 13 counties, including hard-hit San Bernardino County.   Authorities there had conducted almost 100 rescues by Wednesday evening, San Bernardino County Fire Chief Dan Munsey said in a news conference, though authorities have not learned of any serious injuries or deaths.   “We’re responding to medical calls. We’re responding to fires in these trapped vehicles. We are going to people’s houses where they’ve had trees through their houses or some sort of roof collapse and we are evacuating them to our evacuation shelters,” Munsey said.   Just over 70,000 homes and businesses remained without power early Thursday, days after the first round of winter storms hit California, according to PowerOutage.us. And while the state is getting a brief reprieve from the snow through the end of the week, another system is expected to move into Northern California this weekend.

Hong/APNewsom declared a state of emergency for San Bernardino County and 12 others – among them Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties – late Wednesday, with his office saying in a statement that a significant number of state personnel had responded to support San Bernardino County.   By Thursday morning, the Office of Emergency Services had deployed the California National Guard to help dig out snowbound communities in the mountains, with a spokesperson saying they had departed Fresno and were expected to arrive by midday.   It could take a week to 10 days to dig out the mountain communities hampered by the heavy snow, officials warned in a news conference Wednesday. Mountain residents were still unable to access roads Wednesday, per fire department spokesperson Eric Sherwin. The county has about 500 miles of tight, winding roads throughout the mountain areas that need to be plowed, county Public Works Director Brendon Biggs said.   LOS ANGELES, CALIF. - FEB. 28, 2023.

Residents in a three-story apartment building in Olympic Valley had to be evacuated after it was struck by an avalanche Tuesday evening, engulfing the bottom two stories, the sheriff’s office said on Facebook. The building’s occupants were uninjured.   Huntington Lake in the Sierra Nevada saw 144 inches of snow, per a report from the Fresno County Office of Emergency Services, which reported 10 to 12 feet of snow near China Peak, leading to the closure of Highway 168.   In Southern California, 106 inches of snow were recorded since February 22 at Mount Baldy, outside of Los Angeles. Of that 106 inches, 29 fell in the past two days, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward, while the other 77 inches fell late last week and through the weekend.

One of China’s richest women takes over for her father at real estate developer Country Garden    			By Laura He, CNN		  Updated  5:35 AM EST, Thu March 2, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackSatellite imagery may show real impact of China's Covid outbreak as country reopens borders    02:59   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      One of China’s richest women has fully taken over Country Garden, a top real estate developer, after her father resigned, which added to a string of prominent entrepreneurs retreating from their posts during a historic downturn in the property market.   Yang Huiyan succeeded her father Yang Guoqiang as chairman of the company that he founded, according to a Wednesday filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which said the appointment took effect the same day.    Yang, 68, also known as Yeung Kwok Keung in Cantonese, had tendered his resignation from the position of chairman “due to age,” the statement said.   Yang Guoqiang, founder of Country Garden, attends a signing ceremony in November 2017 in Guangdong province.VCG/Getty ImagesThe elder Yang was a farmer and construction worker before he founded Country Garden in 1992. In little more than a decade, he grew the firm into one of the largest real estate developers in the country.  The company boasted a record-setting $1.7 billion IPO in Hong Kong in 2007. Last year, Country Garden was China’s No 1 developer by sales, which reached $67 billion.   The younger Yang has served as a co-chairman of the company since 2018 and jointly managed the day-to-day operations with her father.  Yang Huiyan, center, attends an alumni event in the city of Foshan in Guangdong province in June 2016. Fang Xing/Imaginechina/AP/FILEYang, 41, had a net worth of $9.2 billion as of Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That placed her as China’s second richest woman, behind only Wu Yajun, the 59-year-old founder of Longfor Properties, who has a fortune of $9.7 billion.   Yang Huiyan’s wealth comes mainly from her majority stake in Country Garden, which was largely transferred to her by her father in 2005, two years before the company’s IPO.  Yang’s father resigned at a time when China’s property market is mired in a historic downturn.  The real estate sector has been lurching from one crisis to another since 2020, when Beijing started cracking down on excessive borrowing by developers to rein in their high debt. A debt crisis hit the industry after Evergrande, the second largest property developer in China, suffered a severe cash crunch and defaulted on its debt in late 2021.  Since then, a number of cash-strapped developers have sought protection from creditors.   Country Garden’s stock price has lost more than half of its value in the past year.

Sentiment cooled even further last year after thousands of home buyers refused to continue paying mortgages on unfinished properties.  The crash in the real estate market has dealt a blow to the finances of local governments, which rely heavily on land sales revenue.   Authorities have shifted policy to rescue the industry, including easing restrictions on borrowing for developers and rolling out loans. But the recovery seems to be slow.   Yang Guoqiang’s resignation is the latest in a string of departures by prominent property entrepreneurs.

It’s like, let me tell you what I saw or what I heard, or what people are saying to me.”  “It’s in that context because I’m out every day. I’m in the classroom. I’m out, you know, somewhere in the United States,” she added. “I think it’s a good balance really.”  And on the other side of the relationship, Biden said her husband helps her understand there are different ways of looking at issues and viewpoints.  “Well, sometimes I don’t, I may not see things from his perspective. Let’s just put it that way. And so he offers both sides,” she said. “I’m always better like, ‘This person feels this way.’ ‘Yes, but this is why they,’ – you know, he’s very good at that – understanding why people feel the way they do. He understands both sides, which is part of his strength.”  Her comments came during a wide-ranging interview with CNN on her five-day visit to Africa, which included stops in Namibia and Kenya.  CNNvideo    Hear what first lady thinks about Biden's reelection plansBiden, who has been married to the president for nearly 46 years, has long said she’s not an adviser to her husband, but she is his most trusted partner and wields a significant amount of influence within the White House. The first lady told CNN she is “all for” her husband running for reelection in 2024 but also left an opening should he decide not to run, noting, “If he wants to do something else, we’re there too.”  Biden plays a unique role as first lady, the first to hold a full-time paid job outside of the White House. She teaches English and writing full time at Northern Virginia Community College, a job she also held for her eight years as second lady when her husband was vice president.  From her perch at the White House, she has spent time advocating for education issues, helping military families through her “Joining Forces” initiative and working to end cancer through the “Cancer Moonshot.” The first lady is one of the Biden administration’s most often used surrogates at events across the country.  “I think it’s all so interesting and really fulfilling for me as, as a teacher, and as a woman, you know, to see the empowerment of other young women in them getting education,” she said when asked how she balance the two roles. “There’s nothing I can ever give up.”  “I really feel like I’ve grown so much in this role, because of the opportunities that I’ve been given whether it’s traveling to Africa, or whether it’s traveling to Nebraska,” she added. “I see so many different communities and reach out to people in all walks of life.”  Biden said her experiences as an educator and first lady have helped her build connections with people during her travels abroad, which has included trips to 10 countries in her first two years in the role.  “Joe tends towards policy,” she said. “I try to, you know, go in a little bit maybe a softer direction.”  The first lady traveled to Africa to emphasize the United States’ commitment to the region at a time when Russia and China have made inroads on the continent.  “We want to say, ‘Hey, we’re back. We’re back. And we’re here to meet you halfway,’” she said.  It marked her sixth trip to Africa after having traveled to the continent five times as second lady. She focused on delivering messages about women’s empowerment, youth engagement, and the need to preserve democracy as well as highlighted programs funded through PEPFAR, the Bush-era initiative aimed at fighting HIV/AIDS around the world.  The first lady also looked to shine a spotlight on the severe drought affecting East Africa, traveling to the rural village Lositeti in Kenya on her final day in the country.  “Livestock is dying. There’s no water. There’s no grass. There are no crops. Mothers can’t lactate. They’re not able to feed their children. It’s a major problem,” she said. “I’m here before it gets any worse to try to create awareness and say, ‘How can we find solutions for these major problems?’”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

The North Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 18, 2022.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      The White House on Thursday released an ambitious national cybersecurity strategy that calls for new federal regulation of vulnerable critical infrastructure firms and for software makers to be held liable when their products leave gaping holes for hackers to exploit.  The strategy – shaped by major hacking incidents that threatened key public services in the first year of the Biden administration – embraces the US government’s regulatory and purchasing power to force companies that are critical to economic and national security to raise their cyber defenses.  It reflects a widely held belief in the US government that market forces have failed to keep the nation safe from cybercriminals and an array of foreign governments such as Russia and China.   “We have to drive the entire ecosystem to be more cyber vigilant,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with CNN on Thursday.  The Biden administration will look for new regulatory authorities if necessary “to make sure that we are shoring up our critical infrastructure” in the face of advanced hacking threats “because the adversaries are not decreasing in activity, only increasing.”  Acting National Cyber Director Kemba Walden said that too often small businesses and local governments bear the brunt of cyberattacks.  “This isn’t just unfair, it’s ineffective,” said Walden, a White House official, told reporters on Wednesday.  The strategy is a policy document and not law, but it could shape corporate behavior for years to come as firms compete for billions of dollars in federal contracts that increasingly require a minimum set of cybersecurity defenses. And the White House says it wants to work with Congress to develop legislation that holds software makers liable when their products and services don’t provide adequate protections from sabotage.   The goal of US government and corporate work on cybersecurity should be to “correct market failures, minimize the harms from cyber incidents to society’s most vulnerable,” a copy of the strategy states.   The strategy does not specify which sectors of the economy the administration could regulate next, but US officials have previously signaled that one area of focus could be health care. Ransomware attacks – hacks that lock up computer systems and demand a fee – have put an even greater stress on hospitals across the country struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.   So far, the Biden administration has imposed cybersecurity requirements on sectors such as aviation and oil and gas pipelines. The genesis for those regulations in many ways was a May 2021 ransomware attack by an alleged Russian-speaking hacker that shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipelines in the US for days.  Corporations have sometimes balked at the regulations.  After oil and gas industry groups complained that cybersecurity regulations from the Transportation Security Administration were too onerous and unrealistic, the Biden administration last year revised the regulations to give pipeline operators more time to report cyber incidents to the government.  Multiple administrations, including the Trump and Obama administrations, have tried to shore up federal defenses against hacking threats and in some cases drive big changes that make agencies safer in the long term.   There has been some progress. Agencies now have more visibility into malicious cyber activity than ever before, officials say.   But in other cases, bureaucratic inertia has gotten in the way. The Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, says it has made over 700 public recommendations for federal agencies to improve their cyber defenses since 2010. About a fifth of the recommendations had not been implemented as of December, according to GAO.  In the last month, the US Marshals Service was hit by a ransomware attack that affected sensitive law enforcement information, and the FBI has had to deal with a cyber incident involving a computer network used in investigations of child sexual exploitation.  In the interview Thursday, Mayorkas said it was incumbent on the federal government to share what it learns from hacking incidents so the private sector can protect itself.  “The lessons learned should spread throughout the entire cyber ecosystem and not be limited to the particular domain in which it occurs,” Mayorkas told CNN.  Geopolitics has also been a roadblock to improved cybersecurity. The US has for years tried to blunt the impacts of hacking operations from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, to limited effect. And US officials have accused all of those governments of harboring, or even enlisting, cybercriminals that attack US organizations – accusations those governments deny.  After the big pipeline hack in 2021, President Joe Biden made a big push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on cybercriminals operating from Russia. But any chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago.   A senior administration official acknowledged the obstacle when rolling out the new cybersecurity strategy.   “We do have a problem where Russia is serving as a de facto safe haven for cybercrime,” the official told reporters.  In the last few years, including during the Trump administration, US officials have rallied support from allies in Europe and elsewhere to condemn alleged hacking operations from Russia and China, and to arrest cybercriminals who travel to Europe.  “[T]he criminal justice isn’t going to be able to on its own address this problem,” the senior official added, “so we do need to look at other elements of national power to be going after the threat.”  The official cited US Treasury Department sanctions on hackers and the State Department’s multi-million-dollar offers for information on criminal gangs and intelligence operatives. US military and intelligence services also conduct their own hacking operations to collect intelligence or to try to deter foreign governments in cyberspace.  “We want to shrink the surface of the earth that people can conduct malicious cyber activity with impunity,” the senior official said, “and put pressure on them and make their lives a little bit less pleasurable.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Ohio toxic trainResidents of East Palestine, Ohio, will get the opportunity today to address the operator of a train that derailed while carrying toxic chemicals in their community nearly one month ago. The EPA has ordered Norfolk Southern to meet with residents to answer questions about long-term health effects following the wreck. Last month, Norfolk Southern – which was also ordered to fully clean up the site – backed out of a town hall with local officials, citing threats against its employees. In addition to mounting frustrations among residents, workers’ unions are saying some crews involved in the cleanup have also reported symptoms. However, the EPA and local government officials have repeatedly said their tests show the air quality in the area is safe and the chemicals should dissipate.2. InsulinEli Lilly, one of the biggest players in the US insulin market, announced a series of price cuts on Wednesday that would cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 for many people with diabetes. “Insulin costs less than $10 to make, but Americans are sometimes forced to pay over $300 for it. It’s flat wrong,” President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday, calling the announcement “a big deal.” Although insulin is relatively inexpensive to make, the cost has been a problem for many Americans for years. At least 16.5% of people in the US who use insulin report rationing it due to the cost. At the same time, demand for insulin has grown significantly as diabetes has become the fastest-growing chronic disease in the world, a 2022 study found.

Gas pricesThe average cost of a gallon of gas in the US stands at $3.37, according to AAA, down from $3.50 a month ago. That decline led many companies to end fuel surcharges, a move that has been met with mixed reactions. Fuel surcharges that were added in response to skyrocketing energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine went directly to ride-share drivers and were meant to help soften the blow of high gas prices. Beginning last March, Uber riders were paying an extra $0.45 or $0.55 in fees per trip and an additional $0.35 or $0.45 for Uber Eats food delivery, depending on the location. Lyft riders were paying a $0.55 surcharge per ride. Amazon also tacked on a $5 fuel and inflation surcharge on some merchants. The removal of surcharges means consumers have fewer fees – but it also means drivers will have less of a cushion to pay for gas.4. SpaceXSpaceX and NASA launched a fresh crew of astronauts on a mission to the International Space Station early this morning. The mission kicks off a roughly six-month stay in space where the crew will carry out science experiments and maintain the two-decade-old station. The launch marked the second attempt to get this mission, called Crew-6, off the ground. The first launch attempt was called off on Monday due to what officials said was a clogged filter. The vehicle is carrying two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and an astronaut from the United Arab Emirates. It’s expected to spend about one day maneuvering through space before linking up with the space station.  Video Ad FeedbackSpaceX night launch produces stunning display    03:16   - Source:CNN    5. TaiwanThe Biden administration has approved an estimated $619 million potential arms sale to Taiwan, including hundreds of missiles for F-16 fighter jets, in a move that will likely further inflame already heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing. The administration formally notified Congress on Wednesday of the proposed sale of F-16 munitions and related equipment. A State Department official said the potential sale is “consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and our longstanding One-China policy,” wherein “the United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.” In response, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement today urging the US to cease military contacts with Taiwan and end the arms sales.

He is the author of “The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.” The views expressed in this commentary are the author’s own. View more opinion on CNN.CNN      The Chinese lab leak report from the Department of Energy saying it has “low confidence” that the Covid-19 virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan made headlines earlier this week.  Peter BergenCNNThen on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray weighed in, telling Fox News that “the FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.”  On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning responded to that assessment, saying that the lab leak theory holds “no credibility at all.”  This all adds to the confusion surrounding the virus’s origins. There is considerable science pointing to animal-to-human transmission as the origin of the virus, but there is also credible reporting and the FBI director’s public assessment that it likely leaked from labs researching viruses in Wuhan.  And we may never truly know how the Covid-19 virus originated because the Chinese government didn’t allow international inspectors into Wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in December 2019.  Initially, the local Wuhan government downplayed the virus. That doesn’t necessarily mean they were covering up a lab leak, but rather this may point to simple incompetence – a pretty good explanation of most human activity.  As CNN noted, “top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis” may have been to blame, a conclusion based on an examination of internal Chinese documents from the first months of the crisis.  By the time the central Chinese government got serious about the virus, it was already spreading worldwide.  Security personnel keep watch outside Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organization (WHO) team tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Wuhan, Hubei province, China February 3, 2021.Thomas Peter/Reuters/FileCovid 'lab leak theory': What we've learnedWhile the new Department of Energy intelligence report does not settle the question of the precise origin of the virus, it does point us to the need for a bipartisan Covid-19 commission that goes well beyond US House investigations of Covid that are planned for this year.  Consider that almost as many Americans have died of Covid-19 already – some 1.1 million – as have died in every war since the American Revolution. If that isn’t a significant national security problem, I’m not sure what is.  And yet the United States hasn’t had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened. A good deal of that is likely because the whole issue of the pandemic is so politicized – but so too were the debates about whether the George W. Bush administration might have done a better job thwarting the 9/11 attacks.  The Bush administration initially blocked a commission to investigate 9/11. Following intense public pressure, the administration finally agreed to allow a commission to be formed more than a year after the attacks.  The 9/11 commission not only told the whole backstory of the attacks, but it also proposed lasting reforms that made Americans safer when they were implemented, such as the creation of a National Counterterrorism Center that coordinates all counterterrorism intelligence across the US government and the creation of a new Office of the Director of National Intelligence which coordinates the work of all of the US intelligence agencies.  A similar Covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn’t work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic.  Each party should appoint subject matter experts on pandemics, epidemiology and emergency response to take part in this Covid-19 commission.  It should have sufficient staff and money and subpoena power to investigate questions such as, “How did we get here?” And, “What can be done to mitigate the next pandemic?”    This general view shows the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province on February 3, 2021, as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus, visit. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAssessment Covid-19 leaked from Chinese lab is a minority view within US intel community, sources sayOf course, some questions may never be completely settled, like the lab leak theory vs. the natural transmission theory.  Still, there are pressing questions that the Covid-19 commission should address so that we are better prepared for the next pandemic, which will inevitably eventually happen.  Here are eleven questions that a Covid-19 commission could try and answer:  Where did the coronavirus originate from?After 9/11, the US spent many billions of dollars preparing for a possible bioterrorism attack. Where did all that funding go and why were those defenses against bioterrorism not more helpful in responding to the pandemic?Why did the Trump administration eliminate the National Security Council’s pandemic unit in 2018? What effect did that have? An early decision by former President Donald Trump during the pandemic was to bar non-US citizens who had recently visited China from entering the US. What kind of effect did that have on mitigating the spread of the virus? Why didn’t the US government ensure there were enough medical-grade masks to cope with the pandemic when it started?Why was there so little federal leadership on containing the virus in the early months of the pandemic? Those decisions were primarily left to individual states. What effect did this uncoordinated response have?Trump said on February 26, 2020, that the number of Covid-19 cases would soon be close to zero. He also claimed that the coronavirus was no more dangerous than the flu. What effect did this have on the behavior of the American public and how did that behavior impact the spread of the virus?What role did right-wing media play in downplaying the pandemic and how did that affect sentiments among some Republicans that the coronavirus was being hyped?Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump’s coronavirus response coordinator, told a congressional committee in closed-door testimony in 2021 that “we probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range.”  How did she come to that conclusion?To its credit, the Trump administration launched “Operation Warp Speed,” which saved many lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. As part of that effort, the US invested $2.5 billion in Moderna, which produced a testable vaccine on humans in only two months. Why did Operation Warp Speed work so well? And what are the lessons for future vaccine development? Covid-19 mortality rates per capita in the US are much higher than in other wealthy nations such as Canada, France, Germany and Japan.

The Chasing Life podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta dives into the science behind how technology is impacting our brains. Listen now.CNN      TikTok announced Wednesday that every user under 18 will soon have their accounts default to a one-hour daily screen time limit, in one of the most aggressive moves yet by a social media company to prevent teens from endlessly scrolling.   Teenage TikTok users will be able to turn off this new default setting, which will roll out in the coming weeks. But the feature change could bolster the digital well-being of younger users by requiring them to opt out of stricter screen time limits rather than clearing the higher bar of opting in to them.   Photo taken on Oct. 17, 2021 shows the TikTok booth at the 2021 Hangzhou International E-commerce Expo in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesTikTok might be too big to ban, no matter what lawmakers sayIf the 60-minute limit is reached, users will be prompted to enter a passcode — requiring them to make an active decision to extend their time spent swiping through videos on the app.  The move comes after TikTok and other social media platforms have faced years of scrutiny over their impact on young users, including their potential to lead teens down harmful rabbit holes. TikTok is also facing mounting pressure from Washington over security concerns from its ties to China through parent company Bytedance, including renewed discussion of a possible US ban of the short-form video app.  Cormac Keenan, TikTok’s head of trust and safety, said the company consulted researchers and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital when deciding the time limits to set for teen users.   “While there’s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is ‘too much’, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,” Keenan wrote in a blog post.  TikTokKeenan added that if a teen decides to turn off this new default limit and spends more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they will be prompted to set a daily screen time limit for themselves. “In our first month of testing, this approach increased the use of our screen time management tools by 234%,” Keenan wrote.  Keenan also announced some updates to the app’s Family Pairing feature, which allows a parent or caregiver to link their TikTok account to their teen’s and set controls. Parents will be able to filter videos with words or hashtags they don’t want to appear in their teen’s feed, set a custom daily screen time limit for their teen, and set a custom schedule to mute TikTok notifications sent to their teen.   Other platforms including Instagram and Snapchat have similarly rolled out additional parental controls and features that encourage teens to take a break and set boundaries.

Japanese flags on a street in Ginza, Tokyo on December 29, 2022.Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      The number of births registered in Japan plummeted to another record low last year – the latest worrying statistic in a decades-long decline that the country’s authorities have failed to reverse despite their extensive efforts.  The country saw 799,728 births in 2022, the lowest number on record and the first ever dip below 800,000, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Health on Tuesday. That number has nearly halved in the past 40 years; by contrast, Japan recorded more than 1.5 million births in 1982.  Japan also reported a record high for post-war deaths last year, at more than 1.58 million.  Deaths have outpaced births in Japan for more than a decade, posing a growing problem for leaders of the world’s third-largest economy. They now face a ballooning elderly population, along with a shrinking workforce to fund pensions and health care as demand from the aging population surges.  Japan’s population has been in steady decline since its economic boom of the 1980s and stood at 125.5 million in 2021, according to the most recent government figures.  Its fertility rate of 1.3 is far below the rate of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population, in the absence of immigration.  The country also has one of the highest life expectancies in the world; in 2020, nearly one in 1,500 people in Japan were age 100 or older, according to government data.  These concerning trends prompted a warning in January from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida that Japan is “on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.”  “In thinking of the sustainability and inclusiveness of our nation’s economy and society, we place child-rearing support as our most important policy,” he said, adding that Japan “simply cannot wait any longer” in solving the problem of its low birth rate.  Japanese flags adorn a popular street in the shopping district of Ginza in Tokyo on December 29, 2022.Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesIt's 'now or never' to reverse Japan's population crisis, prime minister says A new government agency will be set up in April to focus on the issue, with Kishida saying in January that he wants the government to double its spending on child-related programs.  But money alone might not be able to solve the multi-pronged problem, with various social factors contributing to the low birth rate.  Japan’s high cost of living, limited space and lack of child care support in cities make it difficult to raise children, meaning fewer couples are having kids. Urban couples are also often far from extended family in other regions, who could help provide support.  In 2022, Japan was ranked one of the world’s most expensive places to raise a child, according to research from financial institution Jefferies. And yet, the country’s economy has stalled since the early 1990s, meaning frustratingly low wages and little upward mobility.  The average real annual household income declined from 6.59 million yen ($50,600) in 1995 to 5.64 million yen ($43,300) in 2020, according to 2021 data from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.  Attitudes toward marriage and starting families have also shifted in recent years, with more couples putting off both during the pandemic – and young people feeling increasingly pessimistic about the future.  It’s a familiar story throughout East Asia, where South Korea’s fertility rate – already the world’s lowest – dropped yet again last year in the latest setback to the country’s efforts to boost its declining population.  Meanwhile, China is inching closer to officially losing its title as the world’s most populous country to India after its population shrank in 2022 for the first time since the 1960s.

So this is not moving output to anywhere, from anywhere. This is supplemental production.”  The company currently has capacity to build about 2 million cars a year at four factories, in Fremont, California; Shanghai, China; Austin, Texas; and Berlin, Germany. It has set a goal of eventually building 20 million cars a year. The company delivered just over 1.3 million cars in 2022. The largest automaker in the world by production volume, Toyota, delivered just over 10 million cars globally in 2022.  Tesla did not comment on the cost of the new plant. The news was a confirmation of plans announced Tuesday by Mexican President  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for Tesla to build its next factory in the country. Reuters reported that Mexican officials said the plant could cost $1 billion.  The company estimates to build the additional plants needed to reach 20 million vehicles will cost a total of $150 billion to $175 billion, including the $28 billion in investment that it has already made in its history.  “Maybe this total investment looks large,” said CFO Zachary Kirkhorn. “I think its quite small relative to our ambitions.”  The company also announced that earlier Wednesday it built 4 million vehicles in its history.  Shares of Tesla    (TSLA) slipped more than 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday, although that was up a bit from a larger decline before Musk’s announcement more than three hours into the presentation. There had been hope by some investors that Tesla    (TSLA) would announce details about a next generation of vehicles. Musk declined to answer a question about the next generation vehicle.  “We will have a proper sort of product event,” Musk said. “We’d be jumping the gun if we were to answer that question.”  In response to another question from an analyst, Musk said he doesn’t anticipate Tesla ever having more than 10 different vehicles in its product lineup. He derided the broad offerings of competing automakers as simply a “shuffling” of many similar models.  The Inflation Reduction Act passed last year restored tax credits of up to $7,500 to buyers of the less expensive Tesla cars, the Model 3 and Model Y, as long as their list price is under $55,000. To qualify for the tax credit, the cars must be assembled in North America, so the eventual output from the plant in Mexico should qualify.  Most of the global automakers already have assembly plants in Mexico. According to Reuters, there are 20 auto assembly plants in the country. General Motors has three, Ford has two, including one that make its Mustang Mach-E, the EV SUV that is a competitor to Tesla. Stellantis — which builds cars under the Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep brands — has three.  In addition Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Audi, Mazda, Mercedes, Kia and BMW all have plants in Mexico.  According to statistics from the US Trade Administration, a part of the Commerce Department, Mexican plants were producing just under 4 million cars a year in the years before the pandemic reduced the supply of auto parts, particularly computer chips, and auto production worldwide. They produced about 3.5 million cars last year. That makes it the seventh largest country in terms of auto production.  But 90% of the cars it builds are exported, with 76% destined for the United States.

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko meets with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing.Pavel Orlovsky/Belta/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko – a close ally of Vladimir Putin – vowed to deepen defense and security ties and expressed shared views on the war in Ukraine during a Wednesday meeting in Beijing, as geopolitical tensions around Russia’s war continue to rise.  Lukashenko endorsed China’s recent position on a “political solution” to the conflict, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout of the meeting, referring to a statement released by Beijing last week which called for peace talks to end the conflict, but did not push for a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine – drawing skepticism from Western leaders.  Both Xi and Lukashenko expressed “deep concern over the prolonged armed conflict” and looked forward to an “early return to peace in Ukraine,” according to a joint statement following their sit down in the Great Hall of the People, where Xi greeted Lukashenko in a ceremony alongside a phalanx of Chinese troops.  The visit from the Belarusian leader – who allowed Russian troops to use Belarus to stage their initial incursion into Ukraine last year – comes as tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent weeks, including over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.   Beijing has denied those claims and instead sought to portray itself as an impartial agent of peace – in contrast to the United States, who it has accused of “adding fuel to the fire” in the conflict and damaging the global economy with sanctions targeting Russia.  Speaking about the war in Wednesday’s meeting, Xi called for “relevant countries” to “stop politicizing and instrumentalizing the world economy” and act in a way to help “resolve the crisis peacefully,” in an apparent reference to the US and its allies.   The joint statement underscored the alignment between Minsk and Beijing when it comes to their opposition of what they see as a Western-led global order, with their joint statement including opposition to “all forms of hegemonism and power politics, including the imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions and restrictive measures against other countries.”   China and Belarus, which was also targeted in hefty Western sanctions following Russia’s invasion, would also bolster their cooperation across a range of economic areas, the statement said.   They also pledged to “deepen cooperation” on military personnel training, fighting terrorism, and “jointly preventing ‘color revolution’” – a reference to popular pro-democracy movements autocrats allege are backed by Western governments.

Kiichiro Sato/AP/FileBlinken's new warning to Beijing is the latest sign of deteriorating US-China relations    Tensions with the WestThe meeting, which Chinese state media described as “warm and friendly,” was the leaders’ first face-to-face since upgrading ties to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit last September in Uzbekistan, which Putin also attended.  “Today we will jointly set out new visions for the development of the bilateral ties … Our long-lasting friendly exchanges will keep our friendship unbreakable,” Xi told Lukashenko during the meeting, according to Chinese state media. He also endorsed Belarus in becoming a full member of the China and Russia-led SCO, where it is currently an observer state.  Speaking the same day from Uzbekistan, which is also a SCO member, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China “can’t have it both ways,” by “putting itself out as a force for peace in public,” while it continues to “fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.”  Blinken said that there are “some positive elements” of China’s peace proposal but accused China of doing the opposite of supporting peace in Ukraine “in terms of its efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war blocking and tackling for Russia.”   He also repeated Western concerns that China is considering providing Russia with lethal aid and later said he had no plans to meet with Russian or Chinese counterparts at a G20 meeting for foreign ministers scheduled to take place in New Delhi in India on March 2.  Lukashenko said he fully supports Beijing's ""recent"" security initiative days after it released a 12-point position on Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Belarusian PresidencyThe tightening of ties between Minsk and Beijing also comes alongside a years-long decline in Belarus’ relations with the West.  The former Soviet state was targeted by sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies in response to Moscow’s aggression after Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border north of Kyiv.  The European Union also does not recognize the results of Lukashenko’s 2020 election win – which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the country and were followed by a brutal government crackdown. The US has also called the election “fraudulent.”  There have been fears throughout the conflict in Ukraine that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another Russian offensive, or that Lukashenko’s own troops would join the war. Before visiting Moscow earlier this month, Lukashenko claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked.  Like China, Belarus has previously implied that the US does not want to see an end to the conflict.   In comments to reporters earlier this month before heading to Moscow to meet with Putin, Lukashenko maintained he wanted to see “peaceful negotiations” and accused the United States of preventing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from negotiating.  “The US are the only ones who need this slaughter, only they want it,” he said.

Her focus is on arms control, nuclear weapons policy issues and Russia-NATO relations. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. CNN      Easy to miss in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s speech to parliament last week was a glancing reference to the possibility of Russia resuming nuclear testing.   Marion Messmer Marion MessmerIn a surprise move, Putin said that Russia was ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the US conducted one first.  While most of the media focus has been on Russia suspending its participation in the New START nuclear arms treaty, this announcement was just as significant, with potentially devastating consequences.   It would signify a further step towards escalation in Ukraine by demonstrating Russia’s intent to use nuclear weapons and could begin another, more devastating, nuclear arms race.  Neither Russia nor the US have conducted a nuclear weapons test since the early 1990s – soon after that, they negotiated the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in Geneva – and although both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998, only North Korea has continued to test nuclear warheads since.   If Russia were to resume tests, other nuclear armed states might follow. North Korea would certainly take this as carte blanche for further tests and there would be concern in the US about potentially falling behind Russia in the development of new nuclear capabilities. All potentially leading to a new arms racing dynamic.

But by inserting this into his ‘State of the Nation’ speech, Putin appears to be creating a false narrative that the US is working towards a nuclear weapons test to justify Russia breaking the CTBT and once again conducting its own tests.   Indeed, the Russian news agency TASS reported in early February, days before Putin’s speech, that the Novaya Zemlya nuclear test site is ready to resume if needed. Why might Russia want to begin testing again? Firstly, as a signal of intent to ride roughshod over all nuclear agreements, demonstrating its capability and resolve – domestically and internationally – to use nuclear weapons.   And secondly, because Russia is developing new nuclear capabilities and has insufficient data without new warhead tests.   Neither reason is comforting. A Russian nuclear weapons test would shatter several decades of international agreements and any sense of certainty in non-proliferation efforts. The CTBT underpins the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by creating a credible premise that states will reduce their nuclear arsenals over time rather than continuing to expand.What would Russian nuclear weapons tests mean for other nuclear armed states?It would foment concerns in other nuclear-armed states that Russia can gain valuable insights from test data which they are currently missing out on.   This could lead to more states testing as they modernize their arsenals. In the US, some political figures would be likely to call for nuclear weapons tests, not wanting to be outdone by Russia or fall behind. A new nuclear arms race would emerge with several nuclear powers competing, amid few remaining treaty constraints.   Workers unload civilian bodies in a cemetery in Bucha, Ukraine on April 7, 2022.Rodrigo Abd/APOpinion: In Ukraine, a river of horrors has swelled to a flood By abandoning the CTBT and expanding its nuclear arsenals, Russia and any other states joining in a new series of tests would seriously damage the NPT. It is hard to see how it could recover from such a drastic departure of its central promise – that the five Nuclear-Weapon States will reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons – resulting in complete and irreversible disarmament.    It would also increase the potential of other states pursuing nuclear weapons again. South Korea has already hinted several times this year at investing in a nuclear program if the threat from North Korea does not diminish. A return to a global nuclear arms race may push them over the edge.  Nuclear testing could also be read as a signal of further escalation, demonstrating Russia’s resolve to use nuclear weapons in war or an escalation of the conflict between Russia and NATO. It would mean a step change from Putin’s rhetorical threats, to a dangerous reality which could easily spin out of control.What could be done if Russia was seen preparing for a test? A Russian nuclear weapons test would not come out of the blue. Intelligence services would be able to see preparations ahead of time. The US and the UK have been sharing regular defense intelligence updates since before the invasion of Ukraine, to signal to Russia that its motives are transparent and to help allies coordinate. They could use this same mechanism to draw attention to an upcoming test and to try to prevent it.  In such an event, the international community should work together to impress upon Russia its seriousness and coherence against a nuclear weapons test.A Russian nuclear weapons test would not come out of the blue. Intelligence services would be able to see preparations ahead of time. Marion Messmer  The response should be to immediately increase sanctions until Russia reverses any test preparations. The European Union should act more quickly on sanctions than it has previously. Knowing the risks, other states who so far have avoided taking a position might switch and join the transatlantic pressure on Russia.  China and India have a key role to play. So far, they have taken an ambivalent stance on Ukraine, abstaining on UN votes and refusing to condemn Russia outwardly. However, they have criticized its nuclear threats.   China has shown that it is not comfortable with such nuclear brinksmanship and equally does not want to see Russia or the US investing in expansion and development of their arsenals. Seeing such test preparations could see China threaten to withdraw its political and economic support for Russia, which would be a heavy blow to Putin’s military ambitions.What could be done if Russia conducted a test?By conducting a nuclear weapons test, Putin may well want to frighten Western states into no longer supporting Ukraine. However, it is far more likely that NATO member-states, worried about escalation, would simply double down on their support.   There are no good options in this scenario: a conventional response from NATO might also be an escalation. A change in nuclear alert levels would send a strong signal to Russia but could also provoke further escalation.   A new nuclear arms race would look different from that of the Cold War. It would no longer be largely a race between Russia and the US and would certainly include China – and have other regional nuclear dynamics implications.   In case of a Russian nuclear test, all other nuclear-armed states (with the exception of North Korea which would be unlikely to join) would need to stand together against nuclear testing and work to bring Russia back into compliance.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook History has several examples where the world came close to a devastating nuclear war and was saved by good fortune.

A US Air Force F-16 fighter jet flies during a public display at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix, Arizona on March 17, 2018. Yichuan Cao/NurPhoto/Getty Images/FILECNN      The Biden administration has approved an estimated $619 million potential arms sale to Taiwan, including hundreds of missiles for F-16 fighter jets, in a move that will likely further inflame already heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing.  The administration formally notified Congress on Wednesday of the proposed sales of F-16 munitions and related equipment.  A State Department official said the potential sale is “consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and our longstanding One-China policy,” wherein “the United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.”  The official noted Taiwan will use its own funds for the purchase.   “The United States’ support to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defense capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,” the official said.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement that “the Air Force has full combat capabilities in the two types of missiles that the United States agreed to sell this time,” adding: “Besides allowing us to effectively defend our airspace against provocations from the communist military, it also helps us stock weapons and boost our defensive resilience.”  “The provision of defensive weapons to our country is the basis for preserving regional peace, and the Ministry of National Defense expresses our sincere gratitude to the United States,” the statement continued.  The single-engine F-16 fighters would be at the heart of Taiwan’s defense in the event of any air attack from China.  The Chinese Communist Party claims Taiwan, a democratically ruled island of 24 million people, as part of its sovereign territory despite never having controlled it.  Beijing sends military aircraft and ships into the Taiwan Strait on a daily basis as it keeps up military pressure on the island.  On Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the US should cease arms sales to and military contacts with Taiwan.  “The US arms sales seriously undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests, Sino-US relations, and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” spokesperson Mao Ning said in a regular press briefing.  Taiwan’s air force has been upgrading older F-16A/B fighter jets, originally acquired in the 1990s, to the F-16V, or Viper, jets, equipping them with advanced radar systems and new mission computers, the official Central News Agency (CNA) reported in 2021. It planned to upgrade 141 fighters to the newer version by this year, the 2021 report said.  Taiwan has also purchased 66 new F-16Vs from manufacturer Lockheed Martin in the United States, and delivery of those was expected to start this year, CNA reported in 2021.  A news release from the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency on Wednesday said the defense contractors for the munitions and equipment will be Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.  According to the release, the munitions include: 100 AGM-88B High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles; 23 HARM training missiles; 200 AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles; 4 AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM Guidance Sections; and 26 LAU-129 multi-purpose launchers.  “This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability. The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the release stated.

Human rights advocate Tong Yi, testifies during a hearing of a special House committee dedicated to countering China, on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2023, in Washington.Alex Brandon/APCNN      Bipartisan lawmakers warned of the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party on Tuesday during the first hearing of the House select committee on China, a rare demonstration of unity across the aisle in a Congress increasingly divided along partisan lines.  The panel’s chairman, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, described the stakes in sweeping and dire terms at the outset of the hearing, saying, “This is an existential struggle over what life will look like in the 21st century – and the most fundamental freedoms are at stake.”   Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel’s top Democrat, argued that working across the aisle is critical for the US to counter the threat. “We must practice bipartisanship,” he said. “We must recognize that the CCP wants us to be fractious, partisan and prejudiced,” a reference to the Chinese Communist Party.   Gallagher made a clear distinction between the Chinese government and its citizenry, saying, “We must constantly distinguish between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people themselves, who have always been the party’s primary victims.”  And Krishnamoorthi stressed the need to “avoid anti-Chinese or Asian stereotyping at all costs.”  The hearing featured several high-profile witnesses, including former President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and China expert and former deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger.   McMaster said the committee “can help determine the combinations of policies and legislation necessary to counter CCP aggression and rebuild America’s and the free world’s competitive advantages.”   The hearing also featured compelling first-person testimony from Tong Yi, former secretary to one of China’s leading dissidents and human rights activist Wei Jingsheng.  Tong described being interrogated by police at a detention center in Beijing about what Wei had said to US dignitaries. “They were truly afraid that the US might listen to Wei,” she said.   Tong argued that the US must confront its own role in the development current state of affairs.    “In the US, we need to face the fact that we have helped to feed the baby dragon of the CCP until it has grown into what it now is,” she said. “Since the 1990’s US companies have enriched themselves by exploiting cheap labor in China and have in the process also enriched the CCP,” she added.   “I am a proud immigrant citizen of the US, and I want my country to do better,” Tong said.  Ahead of the hearing, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have worked to set a tone of cooperation for the panel.  The US-China relationship has garnered heightened attention in the wake of the US shooting down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon, an incident that took place in early February after the balloon had traveled across the continental US. China has denied the vehicle was used for spying, saying instead it was a research airship blown off course and accusing US of overreacting to the incident.  McMaster was asked during the hearing what message China was sending to the US with the balloon. “I think the message is that we are intending to continue a broad range of surveillance activities. The balloon, I think, is in many ways a metaphor for the massive effort at espionage,” he said. “The balloon is important to look at but placing the balloon in context is perhaps most important.”   In a display of unity across party lines, the House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution condemning China’s use of the suspected surveillance balloon. The measure passed unanimously with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 419 to zero.   This story has been updated with additional developments.

In his first public comments on the FBI’s investigation into the virus’ origins during an interview with Fox News, Wray said that “the FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.”  FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks during a press conference on January 26, 2023.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images/FILECNN reported in 2021, citing two sources familiar with the matter, that the FBI had “moderate confidence” in the lab-leak theory.   Wray’s comments come just days after news of the Department of Energy’s “low-confidence” assessment that Covid-19 most likely originated from a laboratory leak in China, underscoring a divide in the US government as the majority of the intelligence community still believes that Covid either emerged naturally in the wild, or that there is still too little evidence to make a judgment one way or another.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a 2021 report that revealed the National Intelligence Council, along with four other unidentified agencies, assessed with low confidence that the initial Covid-19 infection “was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus.”  Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.  Wray said in the interview that the FBI has a team of experts who focus specifically on the risk of biological threats that come into the “wrong hands,” including by a “hostile nation state.”  “You’re talking about a potential leak from a Chinese government-controlled lab that killed millions of Americans,” Wray said of the coronavirus, “and that’s precisely what that capability was designed for.”  Wray said that most details of the FBI’s investigation remain classified, and that it has been difficult to work with the Chinese government on investigating the pandemic’s origin.  “I will just make the observation that the Chinese government, it seems to me, has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate the work here,” the bureau director said. “The work that our US government and close foreign partners are doing. And that’s unfortunate for everybody.”  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs pushed against the Department of Energy’s updated assessment during a briefing on Monday, with spokesperson Mao Ning saying that “the parties concerned should stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin.”    CNN’s Jeremy Herb, Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen and Pamela Brown RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Ever bigger cars pose a growing problem for the environment because they produce more planet-heating pollution and need larger batteries, according to the International Energy Agency.Michael Probst/APCNN      While global car sales might have fallen in 2022, one type of car, with an especially large climate footprint, had a great year: The SUV.   Last year sports utility vehicles accounted for nearly half of all cars sold, with particular growth in the US, India and Europe, according to the International Energy Agency.   This boom comes at a climate cost.   The amount of planet-heating carbon pollution produced by the 330 million SUVs now on the world’s roads rose to around 1 billion tons in 2022. To put that in perspective, if SUVs were a country, they would easily be in the top 10 world’s highest carbon-polluters.   There was some good news for electric cars. While car markets in general shrunk due to factors including supply chain shortages and inflation, electric cars bucked the trend.  Last year, global electric car sales rose by about 60%, exceeding 10 million for the first time, according to the IEA. More than a quarter of cars sold in China were electric, one in five in the European Union and nearly one in 10 in the US.   However, the big increase in electric cars was not enough to offset the growing carbon-pollution impact of SUVs, the majority of which are gas-powered.   An electric vehicle is plugged into a charger in Los Angeles, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022. Jae C. Hong/APElectric vehicle sales hit a tipping point in 2022These heavier vehicles are less fuel efficient than smaller cars, on average consuming about 20% more fuel than the average medium-sized car, according to the IEA.  While the number of electric SUVs is increasing – last year they made up more than half of global electric car sales and 16% of total SUV sales – they also come with problems. Their bigger batteries require more materials such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel, which adds to pressure on supply chains.   “Carmakers are culling small cars in pursuit of profit,” Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility at Transport & Environment, told CNN by email. “But larger cars put more pressure on the planet as they need more materials and energy,” she added.  “For drivers, this means more expensive models and higher running costs, especially at a time of high energy prices. Ultimately, Western carmakers might come to regret this,” Poliscanova said.   The IEA called for or car makers to decrease the average car size and invest in battery technologies. “Rapidly increasing the number of electric cars on the road in place of conventional cars is a key part of reaching net zero emissions by mid-century,” it said.

India, world’s largest democracy, leads global list of internet shutdowns    			By Rhea Mogul, CNN		  Updated  3:30 AM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!   Paramilitary soldiers patrol a street during a protest march on June 10, 2022 in Srinagar, India.Waseem Andrabi/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesCNN      India imposed the highest number of internet shutdowns globally in 2022, a new report has revealed, in what critics say is yet another blow to the country’s commitment to freedom of speech and access to information.   Of 187 internet shutdowns recorded worldwide, 84 took place in India, according to the report published Tuesday by Access Now, a New York based advocacy group that tracks internet freedom.  This is the fifth consecutive year the world’s largest democracy of more than 1.3 billion people has topped the list, the group said, raising concerns about India’s commitment to internet freedom under its current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.   “The responsibility of Indian states for the majority of shutdowns globally is impossible to ignore and a deep problem on its own,” the report said. “Authorities in regions across the country are increasingly resorting to this repressive measure, inflicting shutdowns on more people in more places.”   Nearly 60% of India’s internet shutdowns last year occurred in Indian-administered Kashmir, where authorities disrupted access due to “political instability and violence,” according to the report.   In August 2019, the BJP revoked the autonomy of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir and split it into two federally administered territories, bringing the region under greater control of New Delhi. The unprecedented decision sparked protests and the government has frequently restricted communication lines since, a move rights groups say is aimed at quashing dissent.   Apart from Jammu and Kashmir, authorities in the states of West Bengal and Rajasthan imposed more shutdowns than other Indian regions in response to “protests, communal violence and exams,” according to the report.   India has the world’s second largest digital population, following China, with more than 800 million internet users. The internet has become a vital social and economic lifeline for large swathes of the population and connects the country’s isolated rural pockets, with its growing cities.  The disruptions “impacted the daily lives of millions of people for hundreds of hours in 2022,” the report said. Concerns in IndiaThe Access Now report comes at a time when India’s commitment to freedom of speech and expression is under increasing scrutiny.   In January, the country banned a documentary from the BBC that was critical of Modi’s alleged role in deadly riots more than 20 years ago. Indian tax authorities raided the BBC’s offices in New Delhi and Mumbai in the weeks that followed citing “irregularities and discrepancies” in the broadcaster’s taxes.   But critics of the government were not convinced, instead calling the raids “a clear cut case of vendetta” and accused the BJP of intimidating the media.   Last week, police in New Delhi arrested a senior opposition politician for allegedly “disturbing harmony” after he misstated the Prime Minister’s middle name, a move Modi’s critics likened to “dictatorial behavior.”   People line up to cast their votes for first phase of India's General Elections in April 2019.Pradeep Guar/Mint/Getty ImagesIn recent years, the government has repeatedly justified blocking internet access on the grounds of preserving public safety amid widespread fears of mob violence.  While the country was in the middle of its general election in 2019, with more than 900 million people eligible to vote, some Indians were denied access to the internet for days at a time as they prepared to cast their ballots.  Authorities said the blocking was “a precautionary measure to maintain law and order,” leading many critics to question India’s grand exercise in political freedom during the world’s largest election.   During a nearly year-long protest by angry farmers in 2021 over controversial new pricing laws, the Indian government blocked internet access in several districts after violent skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and police.

Apart from India, other countries that saw internet shutdowns last year include Ukraine, Iran and Myanmar.   During Russia’s invasion of it neighbor Ukraine, the Kremlin cut internet access at least 22 times, according to Access Now, engaging in “cyberattacks and deliberately destroying telecommunications infrastructure.”   The Iranian regime responded to protests ignited by the death in custody of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini by imposing 18 shutdowns – a move Access Now called “a further escalation of its repressive tactics.”  Myanmar, which in 2021 saw the junta remove its democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, saw seven internet blackouts, according to the report. The Southeast Asian country continues to be rocked by violence and instability, while many are grappling with shortages of fuel, food and basic supplies  The “military persisted in keeping people in the dark for extended periods, targeting areas where coup resistance is strongest,” the report said.

Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko arrives in Beijing on February 28, 2023. Maxim Gucheck/BELTA/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      A key autocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in China for a state visit on Tuesday, amid warnings from United States officials that Beijing may be considering aiding Moscow in its ongoing assault on Ukraine.   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will stay in China until Thursday and meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss a range of issues from trade and investment to “acute international challenges,” Belarus’ state news agency Belta reported Tuesday after confirming the leader’s arrival.  His trip comes after the two leaders agreed to upgrade their countries’ ties to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” during a September meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Uzbekistan, which Putin also attended.  Lukashenko met with outgoing Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday and called for the two countries to “intensify” their relations, according to a readout from the Belarusian government.  “We have no closed topics for cooperation. We cooperate in all avenues,” Lukashenko told Li, per the readout, adding “we have never set ourselves the task of … working against third countries.”   Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday reported that Lukashenko visited Beijing’s Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath in front of the Monument to the People’s Heroes, which honors revolutionary figures in the Chinese Communist Party.  The visit from the Belarusian leader – who allowed Russian troops to use Belarus to stage their initial incursion into Ukraine last year – comes as tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent weeks, including over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.   In some of the most specific comments to date about the US response to any such support, Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a trip to Kazakhstan on Tuesday warned that Washington would target Chinese firms or citizens involved in any effort to send lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine.  Video Ad FeedbackReport obtained by CNN shows Russia is getting military support from China    04:37   - Source:CNNBeijing has pushed back on claims it is considering sending lethal aid, with its Foreign Ministry on Monday saying China was “actively promoting peace talks and the political settlement of the crisis,” while the US was “pouring lethal weapons into the battlefield in Ukraine.”  And despite its “no-limits” partnership with Russia, China claims to be a neutral party to the Ukraine conflict.  Jake Sullivan.Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesUS says China will face 'real costs' if it provides lethal aid to Russia for war in UkraineOn Friday, Beijing released a 12-point position on the “political solution” to the crisis in a document calling for peace talks to end the year-long war. Its release, however, was criticized by Western leaders, who accused China of already having taken Russia’s side.  Xi has yet to speak with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky since Russia’s invasion began, though he has spoken with Putin on multiple occasions, including in person during the SCO summit.  In an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua released ahead of his visit, Lukashenko is cited as saying the position paper was a testimony to China’s peaceful foreign policy and a new and original step that would have a far-reaching impact.  While burgeoning economic ties between China and Belarus are expected to be a key component of talks this week, the conflict in Ukraine will loom over discussions.  Video Ad FeedbackSee why Ukraine thinks Russia will launch new offensive from Belarus    03:05   - Source:CNNBelarus has been targeted by sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies in response to Moscow’s aggression after Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border north of Kyiv.   Belarus already had fraught relations with Western powers, with the European Union not recognizing the results of Lukashenko’s 2020 election win – which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the country and were followed by a brutal government crackdown.  There have been fears throughout the conflict in Ukraine that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another Russian offensive, or that Lukashenko’s own troops would join the war. Before visiting Moscow earlier this month, Lukashenko claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked.   Video Ad FeedbackHear the message the Belarusian president told a CNN reporter to relay to Biden    03:10   - Source:CNNThe backdrop of Belarus’ damaged ties with the West – and an interest in diversifying a Russia-dependent economy – could see Lukashenko keen to focus on boosting economic ties with China during this visit.   Belarus was an early joiner of China’s Belt and Road development initiative, launched a decade ago, and trade between the two last year increased 33% year-on-year to surpass $5 billion, according to Xinhua.  In a call between Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and his Belarussian counterpart Sergei Aleinik on Friday, Qin pledged that China would “support Belarus in its efforts to safeguard national stability and development,” and “oppose external interference in Belarus’s internal affairs and illegal unilateral sanctions against the country,” according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout.  On Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a regular briefing that Lukashenko’s visit would be “an opportunity to pursue further progress in the all-round cooperation between the two countries.”    CNN’s Wayne Chang, Frederik Pleitgen, Zahra Ullah, Claudia Otto and Rob Picheta contributed reporting.

EU bans TikTok from official devices across all three government institutions    			By Xiaofei Xu, Eve Brennan and James Frater, CNN		  Updated  3:31 AM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackExperts raising alarm over 'crisis' of TikTok's impact on mental health    03:12   - Source:CNNParis/LondonCNN      The European Parliament on Tuesday banned TikTok from staff devices over cybersecurity concerns, meaning the Chinese video-sharing app is now barred in all three of the EU’s main institutions.  “In view of cybersecurity concerns, in particular regarding data protection and collection of data by third parties, the European Parliament has decided, in alignment with other institutions, to suspend as from 20 March 2023, the use of the TikTok mobile application on corporate devices,” it said in a statement.  The parliament also “strongly recommended” that its members and staff remove TikTok from their personal devices.  TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, told CNN “it’s disappointing to see that other government bodies and institutions are banning TikTok on employee devices with no deliberation or evidence.”   “These bans are based on basic misinformation about our company, and we are readily available to meet with officials to set the record straight about our ownership structure and our commitment to privacy and data security. We share a common goal with governments that are concerned about user privacy, but these bans are misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security,” a spokesperson said in a statement.  “We appreciate that some governments have wisely chosen not to implement such bans due to a lack of evidence that there is any such need.”   Adobe StockEuropean Commission bans TikTok from official devicesLast week, the European Commission announced it was banning TikTok from official devices, citing cybersecurity concerns.    A senior EU official in the European Council told CNN that the General Secretariat of the Council, the body that assists the permanent representatives of the EU’s 27 countries based in Brussels, “is in the process of implementing measures similar to those taken by the Commission.”   “It will be uninstalling the application on corporate devices and requesting staff to uninstall it from personal mobile devices that have access to corporate services,” the official added. “The Secretariat continuously keeps its cybersecurity measures under review in close cooperation with the other EU institutions.”  The European Commission said last week their decision to ban TikTok applies only to devices overseen by the EU’s executive branch.    “This measure aims to protect the Commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyber-attacks against the corporate environment of the Commission,” it said in a statement.    A TikTok spokesperson told CNN in a statement at the time that it had contacted the commission to “set the record straight and explain how we protect the data of the 125 million people across the EU who come to TikTok every month.”  Previously, TikTok had disclosed to European users that China-based employees may access EU user data. The company also recently announced plans to open two new data centers in Europe.Agencies banTikTok is facing similar scrutiny across the Atlantic.  On Monday, the White House directed federal agencies to remove TikTok from all government-issued devices within 30 days, with few exceptions.   The move added to growing efforts by the United States to clampdown on the app amid renewed security concerns.   Adobe StockAgencies have 30 days to ban TikTok on government devices, White House saysUS officials have raised concerns that the Chinese government could pressure ByteDance to hand over information collected from users that could be used for intelligence or disinformation purposes. As CNN has previously reported, independent security experts have said that type of access is a possibility, though there has been no reported incident of such access to date.  Brooke Oberwetter, a TikTok spokesperson, called the ban “little more than political theater.”  “The ban of TikTok on federal devices passed in December without any deliberation, and unfortunately that approach has served as a blueprint for other world governments,” Oberwetter said in a statement.   “We hope that when it comes to addressing national security concerns about TikTok beyond government devices, Congress will explore solutions that won’t have the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans.”  China also hit back at the decision Tuesday, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson accusing Washington of “generalizing the concept of national security” and “unreasonably suppressing enterprises of other countries.”  Adobe StockCanada bans TikTok on government devicesThe Canadian government announced a similar ban on TikTok from official electronic devices on Monday.  Other nations may soon have to grapple with the same issue.   Asked whether Australia would soon follow the United States, European Union and Canada, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the country hadn’t yet been advised to restrict use of the app by government workers.   “We’ll take the advice of our national security agencies. That hasn’t been the advice to date,” Chalmers told Australia’s ABC broadcaster in an interview on Wednesday.    CNN’s Brian Fung, Jack Forrest and Michelle Toh contributed to this report.

But even those who spend their days tracking its movement across oceans struggle to work out exactly who is ferrying it.   As Western sanctions against Russia have escalated over its invasion of Ukraine, more ships have joined an existing fleet of mysterious tankers, ready to facilitate Russia’s oil exports.  Industry insiders estimate the size of that “shadow” fleet at roughly 600 vessels, or about 10% of the global number of large tankers. And numbers continue to climb.  Who owns and operates many of these ships remains a puzzle. As trading Russian oil became more complex over the past year, many Western shippers withdrew their services. New, obscure players swooped in, with shell companies in Dubai or Hong Kong involved in some cases. Some bought boats from Europeans, while others tapped old, creaking ships that might have otherwise ended up in the scrapyard.  “You’ve gone deeper into the dark arts,” a senior executive at an oil trading firm told CNN, referring to this opaque network.  The under-the-radar fleet has increased in importance as Moscow tries to avoid working with Western shippers, and as customers in China and India supplant those in Europe, now banned from purchasing seaborne Russian oil and refined products such as diesel. Delivery to more distant buyers requires additional boats — and ship owners willing to deal with added complexity and legal risk, especially after Group of Seven countries imposed price caps on Russian oil.

Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe expansion of the shadow fleet highlights the dramatic changes Russia’s war has brought to the global oil market. In its bid to keep operating, the world’s second-largest crude exporter has reshaped decades-old trading patterns and split the world’s energy system in two.  “There’s the fleet that is not doing any Russian business, and then there’s the fleet that’s almost exclusively doing Russian business,” said Richard Matthews, head of research at EA Gibson, an international shipbroker. Only a few ships, he added, are doing a “bit of both.”‘Gray ships’ and ‘dark ships’As Europe has weaned itself off Russian energy, buyers in Asia have cut deals. China boosted imports of Russian oil to 1.9 million barrels per day on average in 2022, up 19% from 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. India ramped up purchases even more sharply, logging an 800% increase to an average of 900,000 barrels per day.   Russia’s oil exports to China and India both hit record highs in January after Europe’s ban on seaborne Russian oil took effect, according to Kpler, a data and analytics company. Exports to Turkey, another top customer, also continued apace. (The ban on refined oil products did not kick in until February.)  Filling these orders requires boats amenable to the trip. Russia’s national fleet doesn’t have enough vessels. That’s where the “shadow fleet” comes in.  Matthew Wright, senior freight analyst at Kpler, sorts the boats moving Russian crude into two categories: “gray ships” and “dark ships.” Gray ships have been sold since the invasion — mostly by owners in Europe to firms in the Middle East and Asia that weren’t previously active in the tanker market. Dark ships, on the other hand, are veterans of campaigns by Iran and Venezuela to avoid Western sanctions that have recently switched to carrying Russian crude.  “There is often some evidence that they have been disguising their activities by turning off their AIS transponder,” Wright said of the “dark” ships, referring to technology that helps identify and locate vessels.

Here's howWhile Western countries have banned most Russian oil imports, there aren’t any rules preventing Western ships from delivering to buyers such as China and India, or from providing services such as insurance — so long as the G7 price caps are respected. Ships with European owners accounted for 36% of Russian crude trade in January, according to Kpler.  But the legal and reputational risks of failing to comply with the price caps loom large. At the same time, Russia is eager to stop working with Western shippers. That has led to the development of a new cohort, whose makeup is murkier — and history more checkered.  “The dark fleet that has been around carrying Venezuelan and Iranian oil globally is something we all expected to grow, and it has,” said Janiv Shah, senior analyst at Rystad Energy, a consultancy.  One reason: Sending Russian oil on longer trips to China or India is less efficient than shipping it to nearby countries such as Finland. Russia now needs four times as much shipping capacity for its crude as it did before the invasion, according to EA Gibson.  As a result, an estimated 25 to 35 vessels are being sold per month into the shadow fleet, according to another senior executive at an oil trading firm. Global Witness, a nonprofit, estimates that a quarter of oil tanker sales between late February 2022 and January this year involved unknown buyers, roughly double the proportion the previous year.  Demand could increase in the coming months if China needs more fuel to power its economic recovery.Questions and risksIf a greater percentage of the global fleet is being used for Russian crude and petroleum products, that eats up capacity, raising costs for all oil traders.  “There’s been a massive increase in inefficiencies in the way the tanker market operates,” said Wright of Kpler.  There are also questions about who ultimately runs the shadow fleet. Some suspect a portion of the shell companies that have cropped up have ties to “the Russian state or certain politically connected players,” according to Sergey Vakulenko, a former executive at a Russian oil company, now nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The likelihood of there being a major spill or accident is growing by the day.”Richard Matthews, head of research at EA Gibson  This past weekend, the European Union imposed sanctions on Sun Ship Management, a subsidiary of Sovcomflot, Russia’s largest shipping company. The EU said the Dubai-based firm, registered a decade ago, had been “operating as one of the key companies managing and operating the maritime transport of Russian oil,” and that the “Russian Federation is the ultimate beneficiary” of its business operations.  Moreover, experts have said the shadow fleet may be easing Russia’s ability to dodge sanctions or sell its oil above the price cap. It’s also making it harder to discern exactly how much Russia’s barrels are selling for. Experts including Vakulenko have found evidence in customs data that Urals, the country’s benchmark, is selling for much more at key ports than official prices indicate.    Safety is also a worry. The dark fleet is believed to have a large contingent of vessels older than 15 years, the age at which mainstream oil companies would typically retire them due to wear and tear. Now, more of these boats are making trips across the globe.  “You’ve got all these old vessels that are probably not being maintained to the standard they should be,” said Matthews of EA Gibson. “The likelihood of there being a major spill or accident is growing by the day as this fleet grows.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Pickleball is America’s fastest-growing sport.

House panel votes to advance bill empowering Biden to ban TikTok    			By Brian Fung, CNN		  Updated  10:51 AM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackForget influencers. 'Deinfluencing' is now a thing    01:44   - Source:CNN Business    WashingtonCNN      A powerful House committee voted to advance legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier to ban TikTok from the United States and crack down on other China-related economic activity, amid vocal objections from some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates who argue the proposal is unconstitutionally broad and threatens a wide range of online speech.  The legislation — introduced Friday and fast-tracked by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul — would empower the Biden administration to impose a nationwide TikTok ban under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).   Adobe StockAgencies have 30 days to ban TikTok on government devices, White House saysThe bill’s text specifically names TikTok and its parent, ByteDance, and requires President Joe Biden to impose penalties against the companies, up to and potentially including a ban, if the administration determines they may have knowingly transferred TikTok’s user data to “any foreign person” working for or under the influence of the Chinese government.   Sanctions would also be required if the Biden administration finds the companies helped the Chinese government engage in surveillance, hacking, censorship or intelligence-gathering; facilitated election meddling in the United States or in another democratic ally; or helped the Chinese government influence US policymaking, among other things.  The bill, known as H.R. 1153 or the Deterring America’s Technological Adversaries Act, also weakens a 35-year-old law, known as the Berman Amendment to IEEPA, that prohibited the US government from restricting the free flow of “informational materials” such as movies, photos, news and eventually electronic media to and from foreign countries, even those under US sanction. Legal experts and even some TikTok creators have cited the Berman Amendment as a potential barrier to a nationwide TikTok ban because it may violate the Berman Amendment’s protections for electronic information.  The legislation considered this week specifies that “sensitive personal data” does not qualify for the Berman Amendment’s protections, allowing the US government to impose restrictions on the international flow of data under IEEPA.   The legislation reflects US lawmakers’ urgency amid fears that TikTok or ByteDance could be pressured by the Chinese government to hand over the personal information of its US users. US officials have said that the data could benefit China by facilitating targeted misinformation campaigns or by providing it with intelligence targets.   In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter called for the Biden administration to finalize a proposed national security deal that has been in the works for years and that is designed to address those concerns.   “A U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide,” TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said in a statement. “We’re disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok.”  In an earlier statement, Oberwetter called for the Biden administration to finalize a proposed national security deal that has been in the works for years and that is designed to address concerns. “TikTok Inc. is a U.S. company bound by U.S. law,” Oberwetter said, “and we are two years and $1.5 billion dollars deep into a project to go above and beyond existing law to secure the U.S. version of the TikTok platform.”A lengthy debateThe vote followed a lengthy debate Tuesday by panel members who were split along party lines on the proposal. McCaul and other Republicans argued that the risks of allowing TikTok to continue operating in the United States were too great and that Congress must act quickly, citing the federal government’s TikTok ban affecting official devices.  “How can we ban TikTok among ourselves and not ban it for our children? That is the moral question of today and of our time,” McCaul said Tuesday. “TikTok is a modern-day Trojan horse of the [Chinese Communist Party] used to surveil and exploit Americans’ personal information… in other words, it’s a spy balloon in your phone.”  Missouri Republican Rep. Ann Wagner called TikTok “an urgent, urgent issue of supreme national security risk,” adding: “There is clear and present danger; the timing and the urgency are necessary.”  But Democrats pushed back, saying the public had had just days to consider the bill before McCaul brought the legislation to a vote. The legislation’s breadth would unintentionally affect US and European businesses, they said. The panel’s top Democrat, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, warned that Taiwanese and Korean chipmakers could all be harmed by the bill at a time when the US government is trying to entice those same companies to build chip manufacturing plants in the United States.  “This legislation would damage our allegiances across the globe, bring more countries into China’s sphere, destroy jobs here in the United States and undercut core American values of free speech and free enterprise,” Meeks said. “The legislation before us today is unvetted and dangerously overbroad.”  Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline expressed confusion about how the bill tackles “recommendation algorithms,” saying the term is not defined in the legislation, suggesting that the bill could have extensive impacts on the artificial intelligence algorithms that have come to play a massive role in the digital economy.   Several critics of McCaul’s legislation proposed amendments to protect video game companies, including Riot Games and Epic Games, which are owned by the Chinese company Tencent or count it as a large stakeholder, from being unintentionally swept up by the bill.   California Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, who proposed one of the amendments to create a carveout for Riot Games, called the bill “ill-conceived,” “hastily drafted,” and “precipitous.”   The amendments were defeated, and the underlying bill was approved 24-16 along party lines. The bill must still receive a vote on the House floor and in the Senate. Fears for free expressionOn Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union on blasted the legislation as “vague and overbroad,” and accused lawmakers of rushing the bill to a committee vote within days of its introduction without holding a hearing on the proposal.  In seeking to restrict access to a specific social media platform, the bill risks violating Americans’ First Amendment rights to free expression, the ACLU said.  Under the bill, the US government could seek to impose similar penalties and restrictions on any US citizen who “may transfer sensitive personal data” to “any foreign person” who is “subject to the jurisdiction” or “is otherwise subject to the influence of China.”  But terms such as “may be facilitating” or “subject to the influence of China” could be broadly interpreted to encompass a wide range of innocuous economic activity, and could expose Americans to enormous legal risk, the ACLU wrote in a letter to McCaul and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks.   “It would be impossible for the average person to know what the term ‘subject to the influence of China’ means, and the term is not defined in the legislation,” the letter said. “Would an entity be under the influence of China if the CEO’s sister had moved there, or married a Chinese person? Would an entity be under the influence of China if the CEO regularly travels there for leisure?”  The ACLU also took aim at the bill’s proposed changes to the Berman Amendment, calling them a “slippery slope” that could lead to further efforts to chip away at the law that would “leave U.S. residents without some of their favorite international books, movies, and artwork.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Pickleball is America’s fastest-growing sport.
