U.S. witnesses bloodiest weekend of gun violence so far in 2023 - People's Daily Online,"U.S. witnesses bloodiest weekend of gun violence so far in 2023 (Xinhua) 13:29, February 24, 2023NEW YORK, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Nine mass shootings took place in the United States over the weekend, resulting in 13 deaths and over 40 injuries, according to the data from Gun Violence Archive, making it the bloodiest weekend of gun violence so far in 2023.On the heels of several high-profile mass shootings in California last month and an attack at Michigan State University on Feb. 13, nine mass shootings in a single weekend is ""certainly high for this time of year,"" according to local media.As of Feb. 19, there have been 81 mass shootings so far this year, compared to 59 during the same period last year.Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, was quoted in a USA Today article as saying that ""the number of shootings over the weekend is unusual for mid-February in the U.S.""Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told USA Today that mass shootings underscored ongoing inaction from state and federal lawmakers. Almost all states witnessing mass shootings over the weekend don't require a license to carry concealed loaded guns.""Instead, state lawmakers have pushed Right to Carry laws that either eliminate the need to get a license to carry concealed guns or make getting such a license very easy,"" Webster said. ""But the 'more guns everywhere' approach has been found to increase violent crime and does nothing to reduce mass shootings.""Researchers on gun violence say legislative disorder in the United States has fueled gun violence severity. A case in point was the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2022 to strike down a New York state law that limits gun-carrying in public.The high court´s ruling that set new standards for evaluating gun laws left many open questions, resulting in an increasing number of conflicting decisions as lower court judges need help figuring out how to apply it, the Associated Press reported.In several instances, judges looking at the same laws have come down on opposite sides on whether they are constitutional in the wake of the conservative Supreme Court´s majority ruling, it reported, calling the phenomenon ""legal turmoil,"" for which the Supreme Court needs to step in soon to provide more guidance for judges.The weekend also put a 3-billion-U.S.-dollar industry of companies working to ""protect children or employees"" into the limelight, as gun violence particularly ravaged U.S. schools in recent months, like the attack at the elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year, and the tragedy at Michigan State University last week.As the New York Times listed, the offerings are numerous: automatically locking doors, bullet-resistant tables, Kevlar backpacks, artificial intelligence that detects guns and countless types of training exercises, like breathing techniques to avoid panic during an attack or strategies for how to use a pencil to pierce a shooter´s eyes.However, the effectiveness of such products and services must still be proven.Calling it an entire industry that capitalizes on school shootings, Odis Johnson, the executive director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, said that these companies have very little evidence that what they are selling works. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0224/c90000-10212544.html,24,2,2023

(Photo by Zeng Hui/Xinhua)The numbers follow years of surging firearm sales. Yet they also underscore a longstanding tension in the system.NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The FBI has been issuing more seizure orders for guns sold to suspected prohibited buyers than at any time in the history of the U.S. federal firearm background check system, USA Today reported on Sunday.More than 6,300 such referrals were transmitted to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives in 2020 to take back weapons from buyers when background checks later determined they may have been ineligible because of criminal records, mental health histories, disqualifying military service records and other bans, said the report, citing the most recent data compiled by the FBI.An additional 5,200 directives were issued in 2021, adding to the largest two-year total by far since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System began publishing data in 1998.The numbers follow years of surging firearm sales. Yet they also underscore a longstanding tension in the system: Federally licensed dealers are permitted to proceed with weapons sales in cases when background checks are not completed within the required three business days, according to the report.Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, was quoted as saying that the historic surge in firearm purchases in the United States was ""spurred by the combination of the onset of a scary pandemic, concerns about disruptions to the economy and social order, widespread protests against police violence, some violent and destructive, talks of defunding the police, historic increases in murders and one of the most hostile political environments in our nation´s history.""""The FBI likely did not have the human resources needed to keep up with the surge in background checks for firearm purchases. So it´s a lot more people buying guns and insufficient resources to complete the background checks and deny prohibited persons,"" he said.Seizure orders are issued when analysts later conclude that buyers likely should have been barred. The FBI noted that the retrieval orders represent a fraction of the millions of gun checks processed in 2020 and 2021. The 2022 data is not yet available, according to the report.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0307/c90000-10217920.html,07,3,2023

Interview: China women's basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China women´s basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics (Xinhua) 13:33, March 09, 2023BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Making the move from player to head coach in women´s basketball is no easy feat, to say nothing of making it to the final of a World Cup as both a player and a head coach.So Zheng Wei has many reasons to be proud of herself.The current head coach of China´s women´s basketball team steered her squad to second place at the FIBA Women´s World Cup last year, tying the country´s best record in the tournament. She was also part of the China team which reached the final of the World Championships in 1994.In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Zheng told her story of getting over regrets during a career spanning 28 years.UNFORGETTABLE FIBA 2022 WORLD CUPDuring the last Olympic cycle, China were widely considered serious medal contenders at major world competitions, but failed to prove their prowess at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.""In Tokyo, we were rallied past and eliminated by Serbia,"" Zheng recalled.What made the year 2021 even more poignant for Zheng´s team was that they were defeated by Japan in the Asian Cup final.""Because of these setbacks my players really wanted to move a step forward and reach a new level,"" said Zheng.For Zheng, the underperformance was somehow reminiscent of the 1994 World Championships, where China missed out on the title after losing to Brazil in the final.""It was the closest China´s women´s basketball team had ever come to winning the world title. We defeated Australia to set up a final showdown with Brazil,"" said Zheng.""We had never lost to Brazil in previous games, so we felt like we were already the world champions.""But because we were mentally unprepared and too eager for success, we didn't play our best in that game and left with regrets,"" she added.28 years later, Zheng made up for her regrets, even though the young China side she coached also finished runners-up at the World Cup after losing to the United States in the final.Speaking of last year´s World Cup journey, Zheng mentioned the quarterfinal against France and the semifinal against Australia as the two most unforgettable games, as the former represented a breakthrough for the team, while the latter showcased her players' tenacity and resilience.""It was the best game that France played throughout the World Cup. Their shooting percentage was very high, and it was tough,"" said Zheng.""But our players had prepared for that moment for years. Everyone held their breath and didn't want to leave with regrets.""After breaking through this barrier, the players became more confident,"" she added.In the match against hosts Australia, China withstood pressure even though they were playing without top scorer Li Meng.""When the opportunity came, everyone´s determination to move forward did not change. Although Li Meng did not play, everyone else stepped up and took responsibility,"" Zheng noted.""I think it was willpower that helped us. Australia were a more experienced team, but by the fourth quarter, they couldn't keep up with us.""From the group stage to the final, Zheng´s players kept surprising her with fantastic performances. ""Maybe after breaking through that window, they couldn't be stopped. They did their best to present both technique and spirit on the court. I think there was no regret this time,"" said Zheng.CHINA MOVING TO THE TOPBasking in World Cup glory, Zheng urged her players to stay calm and work harder.""We only made it to the final in this tournament. It might come just by chance,"" said Zheng.""But if we are a genuinely top team like the USA, Australia, France and Spain, we need to prove ourselves in every competition.""A lack of experience is China´s biggest weakness, which often led to inconsistent play in the knockout stages, said Zheng.To change the situation, she stressed the importance of building up a more competitive professional league in China and scheduling more high-quality international friendlies for the national team.Zheng summarized the trend of women´s basketball as ""a more physical game with more vaguely defined positions, fiercer defense, more intensive body contact and better individual techniques.""""I believe we are approaching our goals on the right track through training,"" she said.TEAMWORK IS CHINA'S TRADITIONHaving served as an assistant coach of China´s national team for 12 years before taking charge as the head coach, Zheng is deeply impressed by the team´s tradition of teamwork.""Unity, cooperation, selfless dedication, and never giving up are the glorious traditions of China´s women´s basketball team,"" Zheng said.""Shao Ting and Sun Mengran have passed them on to Yang Liwei and Li Meng, and the latter are passing onto the next generation.""Zheng said that she also had good cooperation with her predecessors and learned a lot from them.""I had been analyzing opponents' strategies for the team before, so I am very familiar with both our players and our main opponents. What I can do is bring out the players' strength and make them more confident,"" she said.BALANCING PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL TEAMThe 2022-2023 WCBA league season is set to conclude in mid-March. Zheng confirmed that the national team will assemble at the end of March to begin preparations for this year´s two main events - the Asian Cup and the Asian Games.""We will play the Asian Cup in June, but some of the players who were in last year´s World Cup may not join the team because they have contracts with WNBA teams, so the mission will be tough for us,"" Zheng said.According to Zheng, four or five players, including center Han Xu and veteran Yang Liwei, have contacts with the WNBA. Zheng said she hopes that they can refine themselves in a more competitive league and return to perform better for the national team.Zheng revealed that the Asian Cup and the Asian Games are China´s short-term goal, while their long-term goal is the Paris Olympics in 2024.""We need to combine our preparations with the two goals,"" she said.""We may recruit more young players who can compete in international events. They are eager to play for the national team. We want to observe them and help them grow.""We hope to add one backup to every position. The national team´s roster will include 16 to 18 players this time.""Asked about their prospects at Paris 2024, Zheng said: ""We aim to match our World Cup performance in every major competition in the future. Hopefully we can achieve it.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219392.html,09,3,2023

"Fair, objective probe urged into alleged U.S. involvement in Nord Stream blasts - People's Daily Online","Fair, objective probe urged into alleged U.S. involvement in Nord Stream blasts (Xinhua) 08:21, March 01, 2023BEIJING, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty days into Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh´s bombshell report on U.S. involvement in the Nord Stream blasts, Washington is still dismissing the disclosure, the majority of Europe remains secretive, and Western mainstream media outlets stay as yet blind to the revelations.The chilling details brought to light in the report, however, have caused misgivings and grave concerns among the international community. Calling Hersh´s report something that should not be glossed over, more people around the world now demand an objective, fair and professional probe into the incident, and a speedup in truth-telling.NEEDLE OF SUSPICIONOn Sept. 26, 2022, a series of clandestine bombings and subsequent underwater gas leaks occurred on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, which carry gas from Russia to Europe. Soon afterwards, Washington and some European countries pointed an accusing finger at Russia.This file photo provided by the Swedish Coast Guard on Sept. 28, 2022 shows a gas leak on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. (The Swedish Coast Guard/Handout via Xinhua)But independent thinkers have reckoned the other way around. Days after the blasts, Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, told Bloomberg in a TV show that the United States, rather than Russia, could be behind the attack, leading TV hosts to abruptly taking him off the air.Hersh´s account on Feb. 8 adds weight to Sachs' assertions. In a 5,200-word article published on the U.S. portal Substack, Hersh revealed how the United States partnered with Norway in a top-secret operation in June 2022 to plant remotely triggered explosives that took out three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later.In response, Washington has denied the accusation on various occasions. Speaking to Fox News on Feb. 19, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby called Hersh´s report ""a completely false story.""However, not everyone bought Washington´s version. In an emailed interview with Xinhua, Sachs perceived Hersh´s report as ""credible"" and consistent with several existing facts.Former U.S. National Security Agency employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden tweeted earlier this month that the United States is wasting time and money to shoot down ""unidentified flying objects"" above U.S. and Canadian soil to ensure that national security reporters get assigned to investigate balloon nonsense ""rather than (U.S.) budgets or bombings (of Nord Stream).""""The U.S. had the motive, means, and opportunity and spent many months confessing to the plot and then to the crime after it took place,"" noted the Black Agenda Report website, citing U.S. President Joe Biden´s pledge in February 2022 to stop the Nord Stream 2 project and U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland´s remarks in January this year that Washington is ""gratified"" to know the Nord Stream 2 is now ""a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea.""There are ""ample reasons"" why the United States would be involved in the Nord Stream blasts, Sevim Dagdelen, a parliamentarian of Germany´s Left Party, was quoted as saying by Canadian website Western Standard in a report published on Feb. 13.""Many European capitals put the finger against Russia and said, 'it was Russia that blew up its own pipeline,' which was nonsense,"" former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl told Sputnik in an interview. ""For me, one thing was clear ever since 2018 that the U.S. was very much determined to make sure that this pipeline system would never ever become operative.""The now-deleted ""Thank you, USA"" tweet posted by former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski offered fresh insight into how much some European officials are convinced of U.S. culpability.COLLECTIVE SILENCEWhen the needle of suspicion points towards the United States, European governments have fallen into collective silence.Denmark, Germany and Sweden are investigating the destruction, but all remain tight-lipped over who blew holes in the pipelines.Last week, the three countries told the UN Security Council in a joint letter that investigations are ""ongoing."" Nothing was said about who is responsible. They only stated that ""investigations have not yet been concluded"" and ""it is not possible to say when they will be concluded.""Not even allowing access to members of the German Bundestag, all information on the matter has been classified as ""highly confidential"" because of the so-called third-party rule that prevents conflicts with the interests of allied states or their intelligence services.""Even if the Germans, Swedes or Danes themselves found some evidence of U.S. involvement in the explosions, they would hardly talk about them because they would not be able to take such responsibility,"" said Igor Yushkov, a leading analyst of Russia´s National Energy Security Fund.Besides, U.S. corporate media have overwhelmingly brushed aside Hersh´s report. A study by independent watchdog journalism MintPress News analyzed the 20 most influential publications in the United States, and found only four mentions of the report.""What´s most strange in this case is that U.S. mainstream media with political and social influence, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, have deliberately remained indifferent and silent when Hersh, a veteran journalist who has proved his credibility in his investigations in the past, published his latest investigation of the Nord Stream blasts,"" wrote Singapore´s Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao on Feb. 11.""When we see this kind of thing (the Nord Stream blasts) going on, we go to somebody who might be able to protect us and might be able to get the word out. Now, this was two weeks ago. Has The New York Times mentioned Seymour Hersh´s article? Or has it even reported the denials? No, not yet. This is quite (as what) the Germans would say, merkwurdig (strange),"" former CIA analyst Ray McGovern addressed the UN Security Council recently.This file photo released by the Danish Ministry of Defense on Sept. 27, 2022 shows a Nord Stream gas pipeline leak site. (Danish Defense Ministry/Handout via Xinhua)WHO BENEFITS MOST?A recent report by Indian news website Firstpost quoted Hersh as saying that the United States saw energy alternatives for Europe as a ""threat,"" and the Biden administration feared that Europe would ""walk away"" from the Ukraine crisis if it felt the need for Russian fuel carried by the pipeline, which was under sanctions.""The fear of losing European support in the Ukraine conflict made the U.S. to take out the only option Europe had should it want to restart buying fuel from Russia,"" Hersh argued.Just like Hersh, many others believing in U.S. sabotage also noted its strategic and economic motives behind the scenes.""The U.S. did not like the close economic relations between Germany and Russia. They are doing something or they could try to do something that could break these relations,"" Gunnar Beck, a member of the European Parliament, said in an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia on Feb. 12.Washington was guided by strategic reasons to close Russia´s energy and economic ties with Germany and most countries in Western and Eastern Europe, Beck said.From the political and economic perspective, the United States is the major beneficiary of the incident, former Advisor to the French Defense Ministry Alain Corvez told the China Global Television Network on Feb. 14.Italian journalist Gilberto Trombetta also said that Hersh´s report is credible because the only one who would certainly benefit from the blasts is the United States.Hersh´s disclosure is ""not impossible"" because the United States has benefited the most from the incident as it can sell gas to Europe at a much higher price, in addition to exerting pressure on Russia, Croatian security expert Mirko Vukobratovic told Xinhua on Feb. 21.Meanwhile, calls for a thorough probe into the incident to restore truth have mounted across the world. For example, Sachs told the UN Security Council in a briefing on Feb. 21 that an investigation by the Security Council into the explosions is a high global priority.Noting the Nord Stream pipelines are major transboundary infrastructure and energy transportation arteries, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Wednesday that China supports speeding up the investigation into the blasts to swiftly find out the truth.Applauding China´s call, Vukobratovic said: ""The Chinese position that the investigation must be objective and impartial is the only correct one. Only when it is carried out professionally can we talk about the intentions of those who caused the explosion.""In her tweet on Wednesday, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary A. DiCarlo also stressed the importance of ""search for the truth"" regarding the matter.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0301/c90000-10214166.html,01,3,2023

US society wrong to unleash anti-Asia hate - People's Daily Online,"US society wrong to unleash anti-Asia hate (China Daily) 15:04, February 24, 2023This photo shows the White House and a stop sign in Washington DC, the United States. [Photo/Xinhua]Just in the recent past, two new anti-Chinese hate incidents have been identified with the left in the United States. The cases are different, but the bias is not. One stems from liberal educators who kept secret the notifications of students who had attained National Merit Scholar status in order to advance equity (dictated by the deep state and opposed to the equality of opportunity that is an American tradition).The second is the case of Asians killed during the Chinese New Year celebrations in Los Angeles.The first involved mostly Asian students — 75 percent of the victims are of Asian origin with the majority of them being Chinese — who excelled in their high school in Virginia. Left-leaning schoolteachers and principals withheld news of the merit scholar list ostensibly to not offend students who were not high achievers and to advance equity.Many of the students who were kept in the dark about their merit status were cheated out of money in the form of a scholarship and/or an accolade that would have helped them get admission to a good university and likely a scholarship. The students were not informed on time to meet university application deadlines as the official merit lists were kept at the school or were with teachers or school officials for a week or more.The students were ""robbed"" and their academic career scarred. Most were discriminated against because of their race and because they are intelligent, hardworking and driven to excel.Critics argue that this policy is not only racist, but also demeans the US and puts the country at a disadvantage in global competition against China and other countries at a time when the US is in decline and fast losing its status as a great power.Some even compare it to Hitler´s pogroms of Jews during World War II, which forced many Jewish scientists to migrate to the US where they helped build the atomic bomb, which brought the war to an end, and later played a crucial role in the US' space program that led to American astronauts landing on the moon. Similarly, many Chinese scientists have returned home in recent times because of the anti-Chinese hate crimes and the Biden administration´s anti-China policies.What the school administrations and teachers did is said to have advanced the American Teachers Association´s liberal ideas. Yet the incident came to light only after students at Thomas Jefferson High School in northern Virginia, the top high school in the US according to the US News and World Reports, complained to the higher authorities about the discrimination. But many say that this has been happening in schools elsewhere in the US for some time now.However, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, a conservative Republican just elected to office, took measures to make the practice unconstitutional, for which he has been widely applauded so much that some people have said he has a chance of becoming the Republican Party´s candidate for president in 2024.The second anti-Asian hate incident occurred in Los Angeles. In a violent attack on a Lunar New Year event, 11 people were killed and nine injured. Since the perpetrator was a person of Vietnamese origin who subsequently killed himself, details about his motives are not certain.The history of anti-Asian killings and racial discrimination against Asians in Los Angeles is legend. According to the Los Angeles Times, anti-Asian hate crimes increased 177 percent in Los Angeles in 2021, with some California officials calling it an ""epidemic of hate"". The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism says Los Angeles is the number one city in the US when it comes to the number of hate crimes.Many crime suspects in Los Angeles are not prosecuted owing to the extremely liberal policies of the city government under district attorney George Gascon, who was elected with the help of George Soros, a financier with leftist views who contributed $2 million to Gascon´s election campaign.Gascon´s policy of going soft on many perpetrators of hate crimes has hit Asians hard, with many protesting against him and his administration. Defending the police, to many Asians, has become an excuse for not enforcing the law when the victims of hate crimes are Asians with people of Chinese origin being at the top of the list.USA Today reported that Monterey Park, the small suburb of Los Angeles County sometimes called the Chinese Beverly Hills, where the incident occurred, was the site of a disproportionate number of incidents of anti-Asian violence and crimes.Monterey Park is known in Los Angeles as an Asian haven, with two-thirds of its residents being Asians, almost 50 percent of whom are Chinese. The mayor is Chinese as are a number of other city officials. Many say a large share of business in the city is conducted in Mandarin. Monterey is a prosperous place, and eschews teaching woke and following leftist ideals, provoking the left in Los Angeles.The media often reports that hate against Asians intensified after previous US president Donald Trump said the novel coronavirus originated in China, and called COVID-19 the ""kung flu"" and launched the trade war with China. A Pew Foundation poll, however, showed this is not a serious concern to Americans.No wonder students at Harvard, led by Chinese students, sued the university for racial bias, alleging that the number of Asian students would be double in the university if it were not for the racial bias in the admission policy. While Trump supported their suit when he was in office, in a similar suit filed by students at Yale during Biden´s tenure, the Department of Justice refused to hear the case.Behind the anti-Asian, anti-Chinese in particular, hate crimes is the ill-will espoused by the mainstream media toward China, alleging that China is trying to destroy the liberal world order, spying on the US, stealing US technology, and perpetrating human rights abuses. This is blatant provocative propaganda, aimed at inciting anti-Chinese sentiments in the US which must be exposed for what it is.The author is the Stanley J. Buckman professor (emeritus) of International Studies at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee. He is the author of more than 35 books on the Asia policy of China and the US.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0224/c90000-10212617.html,24,2,2023
Profile: Gu Ailing: I'm not trying to keep everyone happy - People's Daily Online,"Profile: Gu Ailing: I'm not trying to keep everyone happy (Xinhua) 11:11, February 09, 2022BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Adding an Olympic gold in the maiden freeski big air event to eight World Cup victories and two world championship titles, Gu Ailing lived up to her pre-Games billing as one of the biggest stars of the Beijing Winter Olympics.Yet, besides her talent, what really sets the 18-year-old apart from most of her fellow Olympians at Beijing 2022 is her intricate connections to both China and the United States.Born in California, Unite States in 2003 to an American father and a Chinese mother, Gu started skiing when she was just ""a little pink ball of a toddler."" ""While other kids were busy crying and screaming, I'd already move on,"" Gu recalled.Ever since then, Gu started to sweep youth competitions and made rapid progress - the same upward trajectory as every single talented athlete has had.Gu seemed to have the wind at her back until 2019 when she announced to change her nationality from the USA to China, which triggered a wave of criticism from some western media.""I have decided to compete for China in the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics. This was an incredibly tough decision for me to make... The opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love,"" she wrote on social media.Despite discussions and even unpleasant comments about her decision, Gu had not been affected but gradually became a phenom stunning enough to create envy out of everywhere.This sentiment reached the peak when Gu claimed the historic Olympic gold with a 1620 performance she had never done before in the women´s freeski big air.When everyone thought she would settle for a podium finish before the third and final run, Gu made a phone call to her mom on top of the Big Air Shougang, asking if she should drop in her signature trick of double cork 1440 to secure a silver medal.But then she decided to ""whip out this random trick I'd never done before and go for gold.""""You have the final say. This is your race. I hope you enjoy,"" said her mom on the phone.With a deep breath, Gu slid down the ramp and shot herself into the air.One rotation, two, three, four... and another half - Gu stomped a left-side double cork 1620 with a safety grab to become the second female athlete ever to land the trick after Tess Ledeux.With a race-high 94.50 points, Gu jumped to first with a tiny lead of 0.75 points on Ledeux.As Ledeux failed to improve on her score with a flaw on the landing, Gu secured her biggest victory by far following her success at the Youth Olympic Games in 2020 and the World Cup this season.These girls expressed gratitude to each other after the race.""It is just a dream come true,"" said Ledeux. ""The level of competition was so strong and I am just so proud to be part of the podium.""""She [Ailing] has killed it today,"" the French girl admitted.""We are going through the emotions at the end,"" said Gu. ""I won because of them, because they had inspired me so much and made me who I am. I just wanted to express my gratitude. We are all out here to do this together.""""Lots of respect between these girls,"" said Mathilde Gremaud who took the bronze. ""Ailing and Tess are really strong and motivating. They are pushing me and I hope to be pushing them.""While the press conference could have been focused on the competition itself and the chemistry among the skiers, Gu faced questions regarding her nationality and identity, the answers to which showed why she could become one of the biggest names at Beijing 2022.""I'm not trying to keep everyone happy,"" she said. ""I'm an 18-year-old girl out here living my best life and having a great time. It doesn't really matter if other people are happy or not.""""I am doing my best. I'm enjoying the entire process and using my voice to create as much positive change I can for the voices who will listen to me in an area that is personal and relevant to myself.""""And in that sense, I'm not going to waste my time trying to placate people who are uneducated and probably are never going to experience the kind of joy, gratitude and love that I have the great fortune to experience on a daily basis.""""If people don't believe me and if people don't like me, then that´s their loss. They're never going win the Olympics.""Spending at least two months in China each year since she was two, Gu speaks fluent Mandarin with a Beijing accent. Peking duck and dumplings are her favorite foods.Gu´s natural and intimate bond with Beijing and her love for China and Chinese culture didn't appear to downplay the attention on her identity. But for herself, Gu has been very outspoken about her gratitude to both of the countries for making her the person who she is today.""My mission is to use sport as a force for unity, to use it as a former to foster interconnection between countries and not use it as a device of force. That benefits everyone,"" Gu said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0209/c90000-9955282.html,09,2,2022
