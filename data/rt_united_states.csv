US worsening Syria’s ‘humanitarian disaster’ – China — RT World News,"        US worsening Syria’s ‘humanitarian disaster’ – China                        Beijing has accused Washington of “indiscriminate attacks” resulting in civilian deaths in the country            Rescue workers search through the rubble of collapsed buildings destroyed in an earthquake in the town of Harem, Idlib province, Syria, February 6, 2023. ©                AP  Ghaith AlsayedThe“illegal”US military occupation of Syria has only deepened the country’s humanitarian crisis, China has said, slamming American lawmakers after they voted to continue troop deployments.Ata Friday press briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was asked to comment on a recent vote by the US Congress to prolong military intervention in Syria. Mao responded by urging Washington to “immediately end the troops’ illegal occupation and plundering” and repeal crippling sanctions targeting the Syrian economy.“Since the US began its illegal interference in the Syrian crisis, its military operations in Syria have taken away a large number of innocent civilian lives and caused grave humanitarian disasters,” she said, adding that the US has been “criticized multiple times” by the United Nations and other international bodies for “indiscriminate attacks that may amount to a war crime.”: US Congress rejects Syria troop pulloutA Republican-sponsored War Powers Resolution was voted down on Wednesday amid strong bipartisan opposition, with critics of the bill arguing a troop pullout could lead to the resurgence of terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). Introduced by Florida Republican Matt Gaetz, the legislation sought a full withdrawal of American soldiers within a period of six months, with the lawmaker observing that Congress never voted to authorize the years-long deployment in the first place.Mao also implored Washington to “respect other countries’ sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,” and to stop “aggravating humanitarian disasters” in Syria, where a recent earthquake left more than 7,000 dead. US economic penalties have interfered with relief efforts in the wake of the disaster, prompting further calls from Beijing to drop the sanctions and allow for much-needed aid to enter the country unimpeded.The People’s Republic has previously highlighted alleged oil theft by US forces stationed in Syria’s resource-rich northeast, where they have long been embedded with Kurdish militia groups. In January,Beijing accused Washington of “banditry” and “plundering,” citing local government statistics asserting that more than 80% of Syria’s daily oil output had been “smuggled out of the country by US occupation troops” in the first half of 2022.:    China accuses US of oil theftUS forces were first sent to Syria in 2014, beginning with special operators followed by conventional ground troops and Air Force deployments later on. Though then-President Barack Obama claimed their mission was focused on combating terrorists, Washington previously sent and oversaw large numbers ofarms shipments to jihadist rebel groups seeking to overthrow the government in Damascus beginning as early as 2013.

US Congress greenlights Covid origins report — RT World News,"        US Congress greenlights Covid origins report                        If the bill is enacted, intelligence officials would be required to forward a declassified report to lawmakers within 90 days            FILE PHOTO: The US Capitol in Washington, DC. ©                AP  Evan VucciThe US House of Representatives has voted unanimously to pass a bill that would direct the federal government to declassify all information related to the genesis of the Covid-19 pandemic, sending the measure to President Joe Biden’s desk.The legislation cleared the House on Friday, with 204 Democrats joining 215 Republicans in a 419-0 vote. The Senate’s version of the same bill, introduced by Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, was also passed with no opposition last week.If enacted into law, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence would be required to submit a declassified report to Congress within three months. However, while the White House has declared that President Biden is determined to “get to the bottom” of the global health crisis, officials have also stressed the need to protect classified information. Biden recently told reporters he had not decided whether to sign the bill, leaving its fate unclear.: Why is the Covid-19 lab leak theory back in the headlines?Both major parties voiced support for the measure during debate on the House floor, with Democrat Jim Himes calling for greater “transparency” from the government, arguing that the “factual grounding of the [intelligence community’s] analysis can be an antidote to the speculation, the rumor and the theories that grow in the absence of good information.”House Republican Mike Turner, who chairs the chamber’s Intelligence Committee, also said the “American public deserves answers to every aspect of Covid-19 pandemic,” including on the virus’ origin, which he suggested could have been a “natural occurrence” or “the result of a lab-related event.”A number of lawmakers and officials have suggested Covid-19 originated due to a leak from a major virology lab in Wuhan, China, with FBI Director Christopher Wray recently telling Fox News the virus “most likely” emerged from the facility. Though he cited no publicly available evidence, his comments followed reports that the Department of Energy had also shifted its stance on the origins question, now endorsing the lab leak theory, though only with “low confidence.”China has vocally denied suggestions the pathogen escaped from the high-security laboratory, rejecting the claim as a way to smear the country’s image abroad. Earlier this week, Beijing’s Foreign Ministry accused Washington of “spreading myths” about the pandemic, also calling on the World Health Organization to launch a new probe into the matter within the United States following similar investigations in the People's Republic.:    China presses for Covid origins probe in US                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572788-congress-passes-covid-report/,2023,Mar,11

It’s the second failure in less than a month, and follows a failed launch in February which was blamed on faulty rocket boosters.JAXA said afterwards that it had issued a destruct command as there was “no possibility of achieving the mission.”The H3 was carrying a payload of ground-mapping technology which Tokyo said was intended to be used in disaster management scenarios which would “cover all of the land areas not only of Japan but also across the whole world.”日本の新たな主力ロケット「H3」初号機が7日午前10時37分、鹿児島県の種子島宇宙センターから打ち上げられましたが、2段目のロケットが点火せず、その後、指令破壊の信号を送られ打ち上げは失敗しました。https:t.coDQHAwQx4m1#nhk_videopic.twitter.combo9ncYOKdw— NHKニュース (@nhk_news) March 7, 2023Japan’s science minister, Keiko Nagaoka, issued an apology for the “extremely regrettable” incident, which she said had “fail[ed] to meet the expectations of the public and related parties.” The failure of the H3 “will have a serious impact on Japan’s future space policy,” Osaka University space policy professor Hirotaka Watanabe told Reuters. Tokyo had attempted to position the H3 as a more cost-effective alternative to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for commercial and government space launches.Watanabe added that the H3 failure would have a negative impact on Japan’s “space business and technological competitiveness.”Had the mission been successful, JAXA said it was planning to launch the rocket around six times per year for the next 20 years. Tokyo has recently broadened the scope of its cooperation with the United States’ space program, and has committed to the transportation of cargo to NASA’s planned Gateway lunar space station.Tokyo has also expressed its own aerospace ambitions, which include landing Japanese astronauts on the Moon.

Polish president claims Nord Stream blasts were ‘beneficial’ for Europe — RT World News,"        Polish president claims Nord Stream blasts were ‘beneficial’ for Europe                        The sabotage last year disrupted Moscow’s plans for ‘dominance,’ Andrzej Duda has argued            FILE PHOTO: Polish President Andrzej Duda ©                Global Look Press  Mateusz SlodkowskiThe destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines delivering Russian gas to Europe was a good thing, Polish President Andrzej Duda told CNN on Wednesday. He claimed that the sabotage had freed the continent from Moscow’s plans for “dominance,” adding that it had ended Poland’s dependence on Russian gas.The comments followed media reports that pro-Ukrainian forces may have been behind the attack on the pipeline, which took place in September 2022. Duda said he could not confirm those claims, but insisted that if Nord Stream ceased to exist,it would be “beneficial” for Europe.Poland was a major opponent of the gas pipeline project and even lobbied for it to be dismantled in August 2022, roughly a month before the attack. Duda also called the project part of Europe’s appeasement strategy in relations with Russia.Read moreClaims of Ukrainian link to Nord Stream sabotage ‘hypothetical’ – GermanyEarlier this week, citing US intelligence sources, the New York Times reported that a “pro-Ukrainian group” was behind the September 2022 attack. The outlet also statedthat Western intelligence agencies were aware of the identity of the person behind the sabotage, but decided to conceal the information to avoid a spat between Berlin and Kiev because the suspect has ties to Ukraine.The Polish president, who spoke to CNN during a visit to the United Arab Emirates, also suggested handing all Polish MiG-29 fighter jets over to Kiev, but only as part of an international coalition. “We are ready to deliver these planes, and I am sure that Ukraine would be ready to use them immediately,” he said, without specifying how many Soviet-made planes Warsaw still has in its arsenal.Duda called for Ukrainian pilots to be trained to operate US-made F-16 fighter jets, arguing that Kiev’s forces would in any case be eager to be “up to NATO standards.”“The training of Ukrainian pilots is important and it is quite necessary,” he added.According to CNN, at least two Ukrainian pilots are currently in the US, where they are using flight simulators to see how much time they would need to learn to fly various American-made military aircraft.

The day before, Polish President Andrzej Duda declared that his country would donate its entire fleet of MiG-29s.In a post on Facebook, Nad stated that a Polish official had approached him at a meeting of EU defense ministers in Sweden on Wednesday, confirming that Warsaw would agree to the joint provision of the jets to Ukraine.In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Duda said that his country “stands ready to provide these planes.”However, Duda has made similar statements before. In an interview with Sky News last month, he called on NATO to provide Ukraine with modern jets at some point in the future, but said that older MiGs could be sent in the meantime. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said a day later that Warsaw was “ready” for such a transfer, but would only do so as part of “a coalition with the United States as a leader.”Read morePentagon trying to fit US missiles to Ukrainian jets – PoliticoIn his Facebook post, Nad wrote that “it’s time to make a decision” on sending the planes, suggesting that both countries were still waiting for a green light from the US. However, Washington has indicated it is unlikely to give permission.Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said on Tuesday that his government was “ready to deploy” the country’s entire fleet of MiG-29s to the US air base at Ramstein, Germany, from where they would be transferred to Ukraine. The Pentagon rejected this proposal, saying it was “not tenable.”The Polish Air Force has 29 MiG-29s in active service, while Slovakia has 12 in storage.Kiev has repeatedly requested both Soviet- and Western-made planes from its NATO backers. While the US-led bloc has yet to yield to these requests, the UK announced last month that it would train Ukrainian pilots on “sophisticated NATO-standard fighter jets,” and the US is reportedly evaluating Ukrainian pilots’ suitability for training on US-made F-16 combat aircraft.Russia has maintained that the influx of Western weapons into Ukraine will prolong the conflict without altering its outcome. The supply of fighter jets in particular is a “red line” that would place the West at “war against Russia,” former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned last week.

China is competing in a great Asian arms race because it has no other choice — RT World News,"        China is competing in a great Asian arms race because it has no other choice                        Beijing’s continued militarization is a forced response to US pressure. But can it keep its cool?            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystSpecial warfare reconnaissance team members conduct a field reconnaissance training in Hechi City, Guangxi Province, China, Feb. 17, 2023. ©                Photo credit should read CFOTOFuture Publishing via Getty ImagesDuring the two sessions of the National People’s Congress (NPC) over the weekend, China announced that its military budget would increase by 7.2% year on year. The news made headlines around the world.The Chinese premier’s work report, submitted to the NPC, says the country’s military “should intensify military training and preparedness across the board,” and points to escalating “external attempts to suppress and contain China.” The country’s state media reacted conservatively, stressing that the defense spending increase is in keeping with the “single-digit” growth pattern of recent years (7.1% in 2022, 6.8% in 2021, 6.6% in 2020).Western media took a much different angle, with many outlets making obligatory mention of warnings from analysts and officials that China’s real military spending could be much higher than the announced budget. For example the Guardian cited the US Department of Defense as claiming it could be up to two times higher. These outlets do mention that China’s defense budget is still dwarfed by that of the US ($224B versus $772B), before moving on to talk about the size of China’s navy and infantry, its “militarization” of the South China Sea and, of course, repeating the warnings emanating from Washington DC that “China may invade Taiwan” soon.Such warnings from the US come coupled with a string of deliberate provocations such as official visits to Taiwan, flyovers, and ‘freedom of navigation’ operations. The US itself has made it a priority to militarize the region and to encircle China. None of these points can be found in Western media reports on Beijing’s defense spending – even though they are directly responsible for continued growth in China’s military budget.Read moreSouth Korea and US respond to missile launch by PyongyangOwing to the US attempt to contain China, the Asia-Pacific is now locked in a growing arms race and military competition, and Beijing has no choice but to participate. Washington has initiated a militarization of the region, under the label of its “Indo-Pacific” strategy, with the focus on suppressing the rise of China. To do this, the US has created minilateral blocs targeting China, one being the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, US) and the other being AUKUS with Britain. Additionally, the US has dramatically increased its deployment of military assets in the region, has pushed the Philippines to increase access to its bases, and has also deliberately pushed the Taiwan issue and walked back from its existing commitments to China in order to escalate regional tensions.The US has actively encouraged and pushed for the arming of its regional allies too, the most notable example being Japan’s pledge to double its military spendingand to buy hundreds of cruise missiles from the US. This militarization has been complementary to the parallel expansion of sanctions and embargoes aimed at crushing China’s rise in high-end technologies, which the US sees as directly contributing to its military capabilities. In this sense, the technological and military aspects of China-US competition are intrinsically linked, all in the name of American supremacy over the region.So facing this growing military encirclement and competition, how does China respond? The answer is that it continues to develop and strengthen its military, with the optimism that it can keep up with the United States in the long term. The US military budget continues to be over three times the size of China’s, which is also sobering for those calling Beijing a “threat.” However, this does not mean that China is incapable, as its resources are concentrated in one region around itself, while the US is aiming for worldwide domination. When it comes to raw numbers, for example, China already has a larger navy than the United States and greater shipbuilding capacity.2023 will be a year of significantly increased tensions. It hasn’t started well, with the US kicking up a storm over an alleged Chinesespy balloon, continuing provocations around Taiwan and reviving the Covid-19lab leak theory. But will China bite? It seems unlikely.Read moreAsian ally announces more arms purchases from USOne of the primary goals of this US-led effort is precisely to provoke Beijing so that Washington might be able to induce instability and therefore increase its geopolitical clout over other countries, breaking up positive regional integration. That is why China needs to be careful.With Beijing recognizing it is facing US encirclement, it has to defend its critical national interests, but in conjunction, it also needs to play a diplomatic game to reassure other countries simultaneously. China does not want ties with India to deteriorate further, or to create anxiety for ASEAN claimants in the South China Sea, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia or the Philippines.It also wants to avoid Europe becoming more militarily involved against China, which would represent a great success for the US. China strives to be firm but also calm and cautious. There is a lot to lose in facing a hostile US, but sitting idly by is not an option. A military competition has begun, and it isn’t going away. Beijing must be strong but also avoid “rocking the boat” too much.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572539-china-asia-arms-race/,2023,Mar,09

On Tuesday, a host of German media outlets, including Die Zeit newspaper and state broadcaster ARD, reported that a vessel believed to be linked to the Nord Stream sabotage operation allegedly belongs to a Ukrainian-owned company. The reports also said that a Western intelligence agency is thought to have informed European “partner services”that a “Ukrainian commando”unit was behind the attack.The New York Times reported on the same day, citing US intelligence sources, that a “pro-Ukrainian group”was behind the September 2022 attacks. Pistorius brushed off the claims presented in the reports as “hypothetical”and maintained that the sabotage act might have been aimed at framing Ukraine.Read moreWest knows who is responsible for Nord Stream attack – The TimesThe chance of it being a false-flag operation is as “equally high”as the chance of Ukrainians being behind it, the minister said.

Employees struggled to make the industry listen to their safety concerns until the recent derailments.Over a month after the East Palestine cars spilled vinyl chloride into the surroundings and the carrier burnt the toxic substance off in what residents were reassured was a safe controlled burn, the Environmental Protection Agency has finally ordered Norfolk Southern to test the area for dioxins, substances among the most toxic on earth that are formed when chlorine compounds burn.Norfolk Southern announced a six-point “safety plan” after another train derailed near Springfield on March 4, with proposals including adding hundreds of heat and vibration sensors along the tracks.

Foreign Minister Qin Gang also warned Washington to “hit the brakes” or risk “conflict and confrontation.”“Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our nation’s development,” Xi said in a rare verbal attack on Monday, as quoted by state media.The Chinese leader was meeting with industry and business groups during an annual gathering of an advisory body to the Communist Party. His speech focused on the national economy, with the remark about Washington’s policy illustrating what he called “uncertain and unpredictable factors” in the international environment, which also included the Covid-19 pandemic.Xi normally refrains from targeted criticism of the US.

Yet in reality, its so-called ‘competition’ means to contain and suppress China in all respects,” Foreign Minister Qin Gang said in a speech on the sidelines of an ongoing session of the Chinese legislature.He compared the US government to an athlete trying to trip their opponent instead of giving its best performance. Washington wants Beijing not to push back when it is targeted by such action or slander, the minister suggested, adding that this was not possible. The US trajectory could lead to a disaster that no guardrails would be able to prevent, he warned.“If the US does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” said Qin, who previously served as the Chinese ambassador to the US.Washington has accused Beijing of undermining a “rules-based order” with its policies and imposed a number of economic restrictions, including last year’s ban on exporting certain semiconductors to the country. Tensions escalated further last month after Washington accused the country of flying a “spy balloon” over American soil, which China said was just a stray weather aircraft.

Military activity has continued into 2023, with Pyongyang firing off missiles as Washington and Seoul press on with multiple rounds of exercises, including a recent drill involving a US nuclear-capable bomber.North Korea has repeatedly condemned such drills as rehearsals for an invasion, and insists it has every right to carry out missile launches and develop its own “deterrent” forces. However, US officials continue to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arsenal, with State Department spokesman Ned Price vowing on Thursday to impose increased “costs” on the DPRK until it “changes its approach” and abandons its weapons. Though Price called for “dialogue and diplomacy” with North Korea, so far President Joe Biden appears to have made no effort to sit down with the country’s leadership or hold a new round of talks to deescalate the tensions.:    South Korea approves indirect arms delivery to Ukraine                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572729-us-strengthen-nuclear-arsenal/,2023,Mar,10

Berlin was scheduled to form the core of the military bloc’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) this year. However, the military unit responsible lacks battle-ready tanks for the mission, the broadcaster said on Monday, citing internal documents.The VJTF is expected to be the first to meet an adversaryifNATO is attacked. The 8,000-strong force must be ready to send its troops to the front within two to seven days, but the Bundeswehr Tank Battalion 393 is hardly up to the task, ZDF revealed.The unit, based in the central state of Thuringia, is the only one in theBundeswehr equipped with state-of-the-art Leopard 2A7V main battle tanks. However, not enough of them are combat-ready.Read moreGermany cannot defend itself – defense ministerAt least 30 of the unit’s 44 heavy equipment tanks must be battle-ready at any time through the year to meet the VJTF requirements. In January, the unit had only 17 tanks ready for action, according to the internal documents seen by ZDF. In February, this number increased to 20, still below the VJTF standards.Estimates by the Bundeswehr seen by ZDF show that the battalion will not be ready for the VJTF mission this year, since the number of combat-ready tanks in its possession is unlikely to exceed 23 at any time.The German military has already extended the period formandatory tank maintenance from 12 to 24 months in order to increase the number of combat-ready panzers in the 393rd Battalion. Otherwise, 11 more tanks would have been deemed unfit for service, ZDF reported.Read moreGermany suspends procurement of faulty armored vehiclesAccording to the broadcaster, the unit would have to “borrow” tanks from another battalion based in the southern state of Bavaria. However, that unit has its own issues with tank availability, and its armor has not undergone an official VJTF certification.The issue was blamed on a maintenance plant owned by the German defense industry giant KMW. Internal documents showed that the maintenance backlog was discussed during a top-level “crisis meeting” in mid-February.Officially, Berlin still maintains that it is ready to fulfill its NATO obligations. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius did admit a “backlog of maintenance and repairs” during his visit to Lithuania this week, but insisted that the issue “will now be resolved.” “There is no doubt that the mission can be accomplished,” he told journalists, referring to the VJTF.The news comes as Germany prepares to send 14 of its Leopard 2 tanks to Kiev as part of another Western military aid package.

He also spoke of a recent visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp, which apparently convinced him to issue an open call to ensure that tragedies such as the Holocaust never happen again.“Nazis?

Fentanyl is American problem – Mexican president — RT World News,"        Fentanyl is American problem – Mexican president                        Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador has told Washington to deal with its own “problem of social decay” instead of blaming drug labs in his country            ©                Getty Images  Manuel VelasquezThe fentanyl crisis claiming tens of thousands of American lives every year is of the US’ own making, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador, known as AMLO, said in a statement on Thursday.“Here, we do not produce fentanyl, and we do not have consumption of fentanyl,” AMLO continued, advising Americans to “take care of their problem of social decay” instead of waging literal war on drug cartels.The Mexican leader argued the addiction epidemic north of the border had more to do with social ills like single-parent families, parents who evict grown children, and grown children who stash their elderly relatives in care homes “and visit them once a year,” than any issues on the supply side, even though his government has seized tens of millions of doses of the drug in recent years.Read moreEnough fentanyl to kill all Americans seized in 2022 – DEAAMLO’s statement followed a call by US Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) to “unleash the fury and might of the US against these cartels.” While stressing that he did not want to “invade Mexico,” the notoriously belligerent Republican argued the Pentagon should “destroy drug labs that are poisoning Americans.”The Mexican president denounced Graham’s words as “an insult to Mexico and a lack of respect for our independence and sovereignty,” threatening to tell all Mexicans and Hispanics living in the US to vote against the “inhuman and interventionist” Republican Party.Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard agreed that the senator’s proposal was “catastrophic” for cooperation between the two countries. “They know that the fentanyl epidemic did not originate in Mexico, but in the United States,” the diplomat tweeted on Thursday, arguing “more work is being done against fentanyl now than ever” and citing the recent seizure of six tons of fentanyl that otherwise would have gone into American bodies.Drug cartels that previously moved heroin and cocaine have transitioned to the much more lucrative synthetic fentanyl and methamphetamine, buying precursor chemicals from overseas and making the drugs in massive superlabs. While fentanyl, which is 50 times stronger than heroin, is rarely used in Mexico, the government recently launched a campaign to warn citizens away from it, using images taken from drug-infested areas of US cities.The US Drug Enforcement Administration seized over 379 million doses of fentanyl last year, enough to kill every person in the US. About 70,000 Americans die of opioid overdoses every year, a number that has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, when Purdue Pharmaceuticals’ blockbuster painkiller OxyContin – marketed as non-habit-forming – introduced millions of Americans to addiction.

Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines described China as the “unparallelled priority” of US spies. Directors of the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) also testified at the hearing.The 40-page report dedicates four pages to Russia, looking at both the conflict in Ukraine and Moscow’s role in Central Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though the report accuses Russia of “unprovoked aggression” in Ukraine, within a few paragraphs it admits that Moscow acted because it perceived an “existential threat in its neighborhood” that could “endanger Russian national security.”The Ukraine conflict was described as “a tectonic event that is reshaping Russia’s relationships with the West and China, and more broadly in ways that are unfolding and remain highly uncertain.”Read moreFormer Russian president eyes ‘final nail’ in neocolonialism’s coffinThe next few years will be “critical to determining who and what will shape the narrative” in the strategic competition between the US and its allies on one side and Russia and China on the other, said the report.US spies believe Russia’s ground forces have been weakened by the war and “military failures” in Ukraine, which will compel Moscow to rely on its significant nuclear deterrent. Alleged losses in Ukraine will “require years of rebuilding,” making Russia “less capable of posing a conventional military threat to European security” or “operating as assertively in Eurasia and on the global stage,” they claim.This has probably “reduced the likelihood of Russian military intervention in other post-Soviet states,” the spies believe. They suggest Moscow won’t be able to intervene as it did in Belarus (2020) and Kazakhstan (2022) “to prevent expressions of popular dissatisfaction with the government from leading to regime change.”However, US spies also assessed that Moscow will continue to build up influence in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, trying to “undercut US leadership” and present itself as “an indispensable mediator and security partner.” This includes a strategic relationship with China, “driven by their shared threat perceptions” of the US.Russian officials “have long believed that the United States is trying to undermine Russia, weaken [President Vladimir] Putin, and install Western-friendly regimes in the post-Soviet states and elsewhere,” the report says, without conceding that US officials have publicly admitted to all of those objectives at one point or another.

The yacht belongs to a Polish-based company owned by two Ukrainians, according to the reports.German state broadcaster ARD, SWR radio and Die Zeit newspaper launched what they called their own joint journalistic investigation into the activities of German law enforcement authorities involved in this case.Their findings indicate the yacht set sail from the German northeastern port city of Rostock on September 6, having received explosives and equipment for the operation a froma delivery truck. The yacht was later identified on the Danish island of Christianso, located just north-east of the island of Bornholm, where the pipelines were damaged on September 26, 2022.Thevessel was then returned to the owners,where investigators managed to find traces of explosives on a cabin table, the outlets claim. The sabotage was reportedly carried out by a team of six people, including a captain, two divers, two diving assistants, and a female doctor.Read moreUS spies say ‘pro-Ukrainian group’ bombed Nord Stream – NYTThe identities and nationalities of the suspects remain unclear as they had “professionally forged passports,” which they also used to rent the yacht in the first place, according to the reports.

The media outlets also claimed there had been “further intelligence indications” that a pro-Ukrainian group could be behind it.The German government has not commented on the information presented by the media so far.

It was reintroduced and passed again overwhelmingly last week.“The Senate already passed my bill with​ ​[Hawley] ​​to make every bit of evidence we know about the Covid lab leak declassified for the American people to see the facts without corporate or government censors. President Biden needs to declassify everything we know today​,” Braun wrote in a tweet in late February, soon after the Wall Street Journal was first to report the Energy Department’s revised conclusion.Though the original bill never received the president’s signature, so far the White House has not given any indication it will veto the measure.Beijing, for its part, has vocally denied suggestions the pathogen escaped from the Wuhan virology lab, rejecting the theory as a way to smear China’s image abroad.

These mystery illnesses have racked up burdensome medical bills for many and pushed some into early retirement.Investigators initially pinned these incidents on a suspected high-tech energy weapon, possibly developed by Russia, until an exclusive Washington Post report was released last week. According to the report, which cites anonymous officials familiar with conclusions found by several agencies, the “syndrome” was not caused by an energy weapon and one agency nixed the idea completely that a foreign adversary was behind it. Reportedly, none of the agencies disagreed with the latter conclusion. Investigations into what exactly happened are still ongoing.However, for years the US media pointed the finger at Russia through “scoops” dropped by anonymous intelligence officials. For instance, Politico reported in 2021 that American spy agencies were lasering in on Russia’s military intelligence unit, GRU. These officials reportedly debriefed members of Congress on the matter. Likewise, that same year the New Yorker posed the tantalizing question: “Are U.S. Officials Under Silent Attack?” And, of course, well before this, the likes of CNN and MSNBC were already speculating about a conspiracy on their broadcasts and, as always, blaming the Russians.Read morePayouts to Havana Syndrome victims to continue indefinitelyThe debunking itself comes from a paper that has reported speculative information from “anonymous” intelligence officials in the past. However, it references a number of reports – things that exist – within US intelligence agencies, which lends it much more substance and credibility.It’s hard to speculate on what might have been behind the “Havana syndrome” incidents but what’s clear is that US officials jumped the gun in blaming Russia. If we turn the clock back seven years, we might recall that this was one of the spikes in anti-Russia hysteria in the US. Report after report came out suggesting that Russia “hacked” the US presidential election that year in favor of Donald Trump. Then the goal posts kept shifting, first to how Russia “interfered” in the election, and then to how Russia “influenced” the election.Each of these reports was debunked and some journalists were even sackedor forced to resign over “scoops” that had not been properly fact-checked. For example, one Washington Post reporter got a scoop from officials that Russia hacked into the state of Vermont’s energy grid, a claim that was immediately debunked. Another CNN investigation, alleging that Russia had a slush fund in place for Trump-tied officials, led to three journalists, including one executive editor, resigning.Russia’s vindication regarding the mystery illnesses of US diplomats is a premier case study in unethical speculation by federal officials exacerbated by sloppy journalism. Going back to when “Havana syndrome” first appeared, we will also remember that it was not long after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Ukraine, which nearly sparked a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, led to the Russian annexation of Crimea and spurred events leading to the current Ukraine crisis.Read moreUS spies debunk ‘Havana Syndrome’ conspiracy –WaPoUS officials and their media stenographers were trying hard to drive public opinion against Russia by claiming Moscow was directly undermining America’s democracy and covertly attacking our diplomats around the world. Of course, it was all a bunch of lies, as history has revealed. There needn’t be a foreign adversary to explain the health issues of US diplomats. Perhaps the explanation is simpler, something like travelers’ sickness, which many people experience. One thing is certain, there was never any actual evidence that Russia was behind these weird illnesses – only speculation.We’re now seeing this in action again after a Chinese balloon was spotted over the continental United States. The US government shot down the airship, speculating that it was part of a surveillance operation. China maintains that it was simply a weather monitoring balloon that had veered off course.In any case, the US is reportedly releasing an investigation on this matter. After the latest revelation about the “Havana syndrome”, I fully anticipate the report will show that, in fact, it was a civilian weather balloon all along and not a surveillance op. Releasing defamatory ‘scoops’ about adversarial countries, not backed by evidence, has been the modus operandi for US officials and media for a while now.However, I hope these intelligence reports dug up by the Washington Post can be a point of reflection for the media. Hopefully, they will stop embarrassing themselves by uncritically broadcasting the officials’ finger-pointing. The American people are sick of the lies, sick of the transparently false claims roundly reported in the media and sick of not having a media apparatus that actually discusses issues relevant to their lives.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572580-havana-syndrome-cuba-us/,2023,Mar,07
Absent ‘friends’: What Ukraine could learn from a new report about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan — RT World News,"        Absent ‘friends’: What Ukraine could learn from a new report about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan                        The American exit from Kabul might be taste of the future for officials in Kiev            FILE PHOTO: An Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) soldier mans a machinegun mounted on a vehicle while patrolling an area during a military operation in Guzara. ©                HOSHANG HASHIMI  AFPIn the spirit of better late than never, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has published an extensive investigation into the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) following the US withdrawal from Kabul in August 2021. The report not only offers, at-times shocking, detail on the level of Washington’s betrayal, but important lessons for America’s international allies today.Read moreDogs of war: Here’s why the Ukraine conflict could be about to spread to another European countryIf only you knew how bad things really areThe ANDSF’s collapse was quite a sight to behold. The vast fighting force, constructed at a cost of $90 billion over 20 years, seemed to vanish even faster than the American aircraft escaping Kabul airport. This is despite US officials endlessly claiming in the leadup to the West’s wholesale pullout from Afghanistan that the government was more than capable of defending itself without foreign support.However, SIGAR’s appraisal makes clear this disintegration was a long-time in the making. The February 2020 Dohar agreement between formerPresident DonaldTrump's administration and the Taliban meant that the ANDSF could no longer rely on the US military’s presence in Afghanistan to protect against losses, move weaponry and other supplies around the country on its behalf, or even for their salaries to be paid by the government in Kabul.As a result, the often unpaid army units stationed around the country lacked ammunition, food, water, and other basic necessities to “sustain military engagements against the Taliban” - and any will whatsoever to fight.“The Taliban’s military campaign exploited the ANDSF’s logistical, tactical, and leadership weaknesses. Direct attacks and negotiated surrenders set up a domino effect of one district after another falling to the Taliban,” SIGAR records. “The Taliban’s media and psychological warfare campaign, magnified by real-time reporting, further undermined the Afghan forces’ determination to fight.”                   FILE PHOTO: An Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) personnel sits in the back of a vehicle as he patrols during a military operation in Guzara district in Herat province.     © HOSHANG HASHIMI  AFP                                                        Even before the Dohar agreement though, “underlying and systemic factors…made the ANSDF vulnerable to collapse in the first place.” Chief among them, US plans to build the Afghan armed forces were “disconnected from a realistic understanding of the time required” to do so. This is despite Washington taking decades to achieve a similar result in South Korea.Advisors themselves were also judged by SIGAR to be “often poorly trained and inexperienced for their mission.” Key challenges were “limited or no pre-deployment and in-theater training, and frequent rotational deployments that lacked proper handovers.” These shortcomings meant the US could neither build relationships with nor improve the capacity of the ANDSF.Read moreBack in the USSR: 15-minute cities have unleashed a wave of conspiracy theories, but the concept is borrowed from a Soviet ideaDespite the report’s inventory of savage indictments, it concludes by stating SIGAR is “not making any recommendations” for future US action, or policy, as a result of its findings. Pentagon officials probably wouldn’t listen even if any were offered. An annex of the document notes that the Department of Defense’s engagement with SIGAR’s investigation was minimal, with virtually none of the information requested turned over.The Pentagon “only provided limited responses to SIGAR’s request for information and missed every deadline for responding to SIGAR’s questions or for providing feedback to vetting drafts of this report,” the appraisal notes. For example in November 2021, SIGAR submitted 21 separate questions to the Department of Defense, asking for replies by 21 December 2021. It wasn’t until eight months later “limited records” were given.Lessons to learnStill, the lessons of SIGAR’s report are very clear. First and foremost, its disclosures stand as a stark warning of the fate that could await close US allies, should Washington’s “interests” be served by abandoning them at a given moment.For example, ANDSF members who did not manage to flee Afghanistan following the US withdrawal have either been killed or joined “extremist groups”. Either way, they’ve been completely forgotten about, an obvious outcome of Washington showing little interest in ensuring safe passage out of the country for its former proxy fighters, before, during or after its own escape.

They have been detected in videos of military parades, and training sessions.It was even difficult for Washington to know which weaponry and ammunition hadbeen sent to Afghanistan by the Department of Defense. SIGAR found officials failed to provide accurate accounting of shipments, and fell far short of oversight requirements “for monitoring sensitive equipment transferred to the Afghan government and the ANDSF,” making it likely that equipment could be lost or stolen. Internal controls failed to offer protection against fictitious records being logged in internal monitoring systems.Read more70 years after Stalin’s death: How Western propaganda has rebranded the Soviet dictator from villain to hero, and back againNonetheless, the US did scramble to rescue some of the gearit provided to the ANDSF, in particular aircraft intended for the ill-fated Afghan Air Force.Some of the salvaged planes were moved into storage in the US, while “others have already been repurposed and sent to other countries, such as Ukraine.”The reference to these jets reaching Ukraine is particularly fitting, given it was not long after its hasty retreat from Afghanistan – following 20 years of failure – that Kiev became the primary foreign policy focus for the White House. With weapons, ammunition, political will and public support all nearly spent across Europe and North America, the current proxy war with Russia probably can't be sustained for two decades, and maybe not even two years.Ukrainian leaders might want to to consult the testimony of an anonymous State Department official, quoted in the SIGAR report.“For a long time [the Afghan government] did not take seriously that we were serious about withdrawal, and total withdrawal. They would tell me, Afghanistan is the most important piece of real estate in the world, how could you leave a territory as important geopolitically?” the official revealed. “I tried to plead with [the Afghan President], saying I know he’s very well-connected but, in our system, the President ultimately decides, and he should take this seriously not to miscalculate.”ByFelix LivshitzFeature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572642-abandoned-puppets-us-afghan/,2023,Mar,10

Arguing that Congress never authorized military action in Syria to begin with, Gaetz slammed lawmakers on both sides of the aisle following the ill-fated vote.“There is no role for the United States of America in Syria. We are not a Middle Eastern power. We have tried to build a democracy out of sand, blood, and Arab militias,”hesaid on the House floor. “Time and again, the work we do does not reduce chaos. Oftentimes, it causes chaos – the very chaos that then subsequently leads to terrorism. While today’s vote may have failed, my fight to end forever wars and bring our troops home has only just begun.”: Top US general visits troops in SyriaOpponents of the War Powers Resolution voiced fears that a US pullout could mean the revival of terrorist groups in the region. Democrat Gregory Meeks argued that while he does not support an “indefinite” deployment, a withdrawal would be “premature.” He did not offer an alternative timeframe for when US forces should leave the country, having occupied Syrian territory intermittently for nearly a decade despite years of vocal objections from the government in Damascus.Gaetz said several prior Inspector General reports concluded a resurgence of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Syria was “unlikely,” instead claiming the American presence has served as a “recruiting tool” for the infamous terrorist cell.“We have to also acknowledge Syria and Iraq are the two countries on the planet Earth where we have done the most to fund ISIS. We give weapons to these so-called moderate rebels… and it turns out they’re not that moderate,” he continued, referring to President Barack Obama’s policy to arm rebel groups seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, many of which kept close ties with Al-Qaeda and other jihadist factions.Though Congress never approved troop deployments in Syria, three successive presidents have cited the military authorization passed after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 to support the decision. The same measure has been invoked as legal justification for more than 40 US military operations in at least 19 countries around the world since 2001, according to the Congressional Research Service.:    China accuses US of oil theft                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572663-congress-rejects-syria-pullout/,2023,Mar,09

The clips show Capitol Police peacefully escorting a number of Trump supporters through the Capitol building during the riot, including so-called ‘Qanon Shaman’ Jacob Chansley, while suggesting that a man called Ray Epps – who some Trump supporters allege was a federal agent tasked with inciting violence against police officers – lied about leaving the Capitol before violence broke out.Read moreMcCarthy defends sharing US Capitol riot footage with Tucker CarlsonThe committee’s final report, on the other hand, declared the riot a “violent insurrection” aimed at “overthrowing our democracy.” The committee recommended in December that Trump be criminally charged with inciting an insurrection attempt, obstructing Congress, and conspiring to defraud the United States, arguing that a speech he gave to the crowd before the riot had instigated the riot.Trump, who is running for office again in 2024, has not been criminally charged, but faces numerous civil lawsuits over his alleged role in fomenting the riot. More than 100 police officers say they were injured on the day, while four Trump supporters died. Two died of natural causes and one of an accidental overdose, while Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt was shot by a Capitol Police officer near the entrance to the House chamber.In an earlier Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump said that the footage shown by Carlson “sheds an entirely different light on what actually happened” on January 6, 2021. Carlson said that while there were some “hooligans” in the crowd that day, the majority of so-called “insurrectionists” were “sightseers.”Out of more than 950 people charged in connection with the riot, 351 have been sentenced and 192 incarcerated. Around three quarters of those who pleaded guilty did so to misdemeanors, according to the Department of Justice.

To ensure that outcome, the leadership in Beijing would need to establish control over Taiwan’s airspace as well as sea lanes, Keane suggested.The US would be well advised to beef up its “deterrence capability” in the region to “prevent a war,” the retired general added. To this end, Keane stated that Washington should increase weapons production as well as double down on arming Taipei.: Taiwan issues China warningAccording to the retired general, another important task for the US is to ensure that regional powers such as Australia, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines are on board in case Washington faces off with Beijing militarily.Addressing the delegates of China’s National People’s Congress last Sunday, outgoing Premier Li Keqiang emphasized Beijing’s determination to “advance the process of China’s peaceful reunification” while taking resolute steps to oppose Taiwanese independence.The official also announced a 7.2% boost in China’s defense spending, taking it to some $230 billion.In recent years, senior Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, have repeatedly asserted that military options are not off the table regarding Taiwan.Taiwan has been de facto independent since 1949, when the losing side in the Chinese civil war fled to the island and established its own administration. While most countries, including the US, profess to abide by the ‘One China’ principle and do not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, the self-governing island has long enjoyed close ties with Washington.China considers Taiwan an inalienable part of its territory which is temporarily occupied by separatists.

Directors of the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) also testified at the hearing, alongside Haines.Beijing voiced unusually sharp criticism of US policies this week, with President Xi Jinping telling a meeting of industry and business leaders on Monday that Washington had embarked on “all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China.”On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned the US that if it “does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing and there will surely be conflict and confrontation.”                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572652-us-spies-china-threat/,2023,Mar,08

The move comes amid growing discontent over judicial reforms planned by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.As many as 37 of the 40 reservists serving in the 69th fighter squadron said last Sunday that they would boycott a training session on Wednesday in solidarity with anti-reform protesters.The reform in question, which sparked massive protests in Israel, would allow the government to control the appointment of judges, including those of the Supreme Court, and allow parliament to overrule the top court’s decisions with a simple majority.Late on Tuesday, the pilots softened their stance and announced that they would report to the unit, but only to hold a discussion on the political developments with their commanders.“We are responding to the call of our commanders and will report to the unit tomorrow for a dialogue with the soldiers. We have full confidence in our commanders, and we will continue to serve the Jewish and democratic State of Israel as long as it is required,” the protesting pilots said in a statement cited by the Israeli media.Read moreIsrael can’t find pilots for Netanyahu – mediaA lieutenant colonel serving with the unit told the Jerusalem Post that the pilots “will continue to serve the Jewish and democratic Israel, beyond the borders of the enemy at all times.”However, he said, they have “decided to stop for one day of scheduled training to talk about the worrying processes which the state is experiencing,” adding that the pilots “require dialogue” on issues that impact them.The Times of Israel reported that the protesting pilots had only agreed to talk to the commanders and still refused to train. Known as ‘The Hammers’, the 69th Israeli Air Force Squadron is considered to be one of the most elite air force units. In 2007, the squadron carried out a strike on a Syrian nuclear reactor.The protest is just the tip of the iceberg, according to Israeli media, which said a growing number of Israel Defense Force (IDF) units are joining the judicial reform demonstrations, with members also threatening to boycott exercises.On Monday, Netanyahu slammed the reservists’ protest, saying it “threatens the foundations of our existence” and has “no place in our ranks.” Meanwhile, around 6,000 IDF reservists signed a petition affirming their commitment to service and demanding the army be kept independent of politics.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one official claimed that China is “not in a good situation right now,” suggesting a trip to Taiwan by McCarthy could carry risks.“We shared some intelligence about what the Chinese Communist Party is recently up to and the kinds of threats they pose,” the official said, referring to its communications with McCarthy’s office. They offered no specifics on what sort of danger the lawmaker might face.: Taiwan boosting military ties with Washington – presidentWhile McCarthy declared last summer that he would visit the island should he take the speaker’s role, his team has agreed to a meeting in the US instead, an effort to “avoid an aggressive response from Beijing,” according to the Times.A trip to Taipei last August by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, triggered days of unprecedented military drills by Beijing, which launched major exercises in the airspace and waters surrounding Taiwan, including simulated blockades of the island. Though lower-ranking US delegations have been sent to Taiwan in the months since, those trips were not met with war games, but nonetheless prompted stern warnings from Beijing, which considers the island part of its sovereign territory.McCarthy’s office declined to comment on the reported meeting with Tsai, however Taiwanese officials said she would travel to the US sometime in April, while the Reagan Library in southern California has confirmed a speaking engagement for the leader during the same trip.:    US ‘quadrupling’ number of troops in Taiwan – WSJTaiwan has been self-governed since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, but never officially declared independence from China.
