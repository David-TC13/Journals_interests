UK's ethnic minorities more likely to die from COVID-19: The Guardian - People's Daily Online,"UK´s ethnic minorities more likely to die from COVID-19: The Guardian (Xinhua) 13:41, March 03, 2023LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- In a recent opinion piece carried by The Guardian, Safiah Ngah lamented the fact that people from ethnic minorities were more likely to die from COVID-19 but Britain has been slow in dealing with structural racism.To illustrate her point, she cited the death of her father, a Malaysian national who came to Britain in the 1970s and later settled here. He worked for the National Health Service (NHS) for nearly 40 years.Citing new data from the Office for National Statistics, Ngah said her dad, a non-white person, was significantly more likely to die from COVID-19.""His death and the deaths of so many others from 'minority' ethnic groups were the result of consistent and incontrovertible failures within government, and apathy towards the communities most affected by the virus. This apathy has unfortunately extended into the way the inquiry itself has been conducted,"" she said.When the COVID inquiry began last year, she felt cautiously optimistic about its potential to allow families like hers, who have been bereaved by COVID, to understand the context within which their loved ones died.""Sadly, the inquiry is refusing to look at the issue of structural racism, or listen to those who were bereaved. Families like mine are being let down all over again,"" she said.The inquiry is terrified of touching the issue of race: it wouldn't even use the word in its terms of reference, she said, adding that the inquiry announced this month that structural racism would not be examined in its first module on pandemic preparation, as it would be an ""impossible task.""""Structural racism is a challenging issue. It is also an issue that lies at the heart of the UK´s high death rate, thus it is absolutely necessary to a thorough and fair inquiry into the pandemic. An inquiry that refuses to examine the most challenging issues is entirely redundant,"" she said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0303/c90000-10215683.html,3,3,2023,"['inquiry', 'covid', 'structural', 'racism', 'issue', 'ethnic', 'die', 'death', 'national', 'minorities', 'guardian', 'ngah', 'britain', 'apathy', 'families', 'bereaved', 'pandemic', 'challenging', 'london', 'recent']",0.6127811447811448

"China anticipated to steadily, reasonably expand defense budget amid military spending growth around world - People's Daily Online","China anticipated to steadily, reasonably expand defense budget amid military spending growth around worldBy Liu Xuanzun (Global Times) 08:38, March 02, 2023The amphibious dock landing ships Wuzhishan (Hull 987), Kunlunshan (Hull 998) and Changbaishan (Hull 989) attached to a landing ship flotilla with the navy under the PLA Southern Theater Command steam alongside in waters of the South China Sea during a maritime training exercise on November 18, 2020. The exercise lasted four days, focusing on 10 subjects including comprehensive defense, Landing Craft Air Cushion´s (LCAC) transfer, visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) operation, and live-fire operations. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Liu Jian)It is likely that China will steadily and reasonably increase its military expenditure in 2023, according to predictions made by experts and analysts the Global Times has reached, as they cited China´s national defense modernization and the security tensions China is being confronted with among the reasons that incentivize the growth.A defense budget draft for the year 2023 is scheduled to be released at the opening of the annual session of the National People´s Congress (NPC), the country´s top legislature, on Sunday.China´s defense budget for 2022 was set at 1.45 trillion yuan ($230 billion), an increase of 7.1 percent, faster than the 6.8 percent in 2021 and 6.6 percent in 2020.The country has maintained single-digit growths in its annual defense budget since 2016.Chinese military expert Fu Qianshao told the Global Times that China will very likely continue to steadily expand its defense budget in 2023.The modernization of the Chinese People´s Liberation Army requires a large funding in order to procure advanced equipment and maintain a high level of training, Fu said.National defense modernization takes decades, requiring China to maintain a certain level of defense spending for many years, Fu said. Citing the very low military expenditure when China had to focus on economic development before the 2000s, he said that China is only picking up what has been left.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that China´s defense budget growth rate for 2023 could be higher than that of 2022.Over the past year, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to a severe deterioration in the global security situation. Around China, then US house speaker Nancy Pelosi provocatively visited China´s Taiwan region in August 2022, the US frequently hyped a potential conflict between China and the US, and Japan has broken away from its defense-only principle and has started procuring offensive missiles that could reach China.Under such an unfavorable situation, China needs to enhance its armed forces' combat readiness, including boosting the procurement of new weapons and equipment, intensifying realistic combat-oriented exercises, and improving troop welfare, which all require extra funding, Song said.Overcoming headwinds including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, China´s GDP expanded by 3 percent year-on-year in 2022, and buoyed by the country´s optimized epidemic response and effective pro-growth policies, some economists predicted China´s GDP may post a strong 6 percent year-on-year growth at most in 2023.This will lay a solid foundation for a possible defense budget growth, experts said.China´s defense budget in 2022 Graphic: Deng Zijun/GTGlobal expenditure hikesThe latest US National Defense Authorization Act signed in December 2022 authorized $817 billion in spending for the Pentagon for fiscal year 2023, CNN reported at the time.This means that US military expenditure remains three to four times that of China, retaining its position as the top of the world by far, at a time when some US officials and military leaders have been hyping a potential military conflict with China.Japan in December 2022 approved a record-high 6.8 trillion yen ($51 billion) draft defense budget for fiscal 2023, marking a whopping 26.3 percent increase from 2022, after pledging to acquire capabilities to strike other countries in a major policy shift under the country´s war-renouncing constitution, Kyodo News reported at the time.Some other countries like India, the UK, France, Germany and Australia are all planning to increase their defense spending, according to media reports.Over the past few years, China´s military spending has been kept at about 1.3 percent of GDP, while the figure for the US is about 3.5 percent, and the NATO guideline is 2 percent.If China joins the global trend of defense spending hikes, it should not be considered as participating in an arms race, as China´s military expenditure accounts for only a small proportion of its GDP, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times.Considering the world average, China has room to further raise its defense budget to meet the corresponding status as a major country in the world, the expert said.China follows a national defense strategy that is defensive in nature, which means that its military spending is used to safeguard the country´s national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests, rather than to violate others and build up hegemony like the US, the expert said.A strong Chinese military is a positive asset to the world, analysts said. In terms of the traditional security field, it brings balance and constitutes a stable factor, and in terms of the non-traditional security field, it actively provides international public security goods like far sea escorts, peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, they said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0302/c90000-10214835.html,2,3,2023,"['china', 'defense', 'military', 'budget', 'spending', 'global', 'growth', 'times', 'national', 'country', 'expenditure', 'security', 'expert', 'increase', 'gdp', 'steadily', 'landing', 'hull', 'including', 'modernization']",0.38795555555555566
UK gov't introduces laws to mitigate disruption of strikes on public - People's Daily Online,"UK gov't introduces laws to mitigate disruption of strikes on public (Xinhua) 10:28, January 11, 2023LONDON, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) government on Tuesday introduced new laws that would enable it to set minimum levels of service during strikes to ensure the safety of the public and their access to public services.In a bid to mitigate the disruptions caused by strikes, the bill would ensure that crucial public services, such as rail, ambulances and fire services, maintain a minimum service during industrial action, ""reducing risk to life and ensuring the public can still get to work,"" a government statement said.""The first job of any government is to keep the public safe. Because whilst we absolutely believe in the ability to strike, we are duty-bound to protect the lives and livelihoods of the British people,"" Business Secretary Grant Shapps said in the statement.The UK has been in the grip of a wave of strikes, which started in summer 2022 and continued into this year, as inflation has stayed consistently high and pay rises failed to keep up. Rail workers and nurses were among those who staged the action.The government locked horns with the trade unions. It said the pay rises that unions had called for were unaffordable and higher pay would not help fight inflation. On Monday, government ministers and unions met, but the talks once again failed to change course.The unions criticized the new legislation on Tuesday. This bill was ""another dangerous gimmick"" from a government that should be negotiating to resolve the current crisis, said General Secretary Sharon Graham of Unite, one of the largest trade unions in the UK.""Evidence from abroad clearly shows this kind of legislation only forces unions to use other tactics, inflaming and prolonging disputes,"" Graham added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0111/c90000-10194443.html,11,1,2023,"['public', 'government', 'unions', 'strikes', 'services', 'pay', 'laws', 'mitigate', 'tuesday', 'minimum', 'service', 'ensure', 'bill', 'rail', 'action', 'statement', 'secretary', 'inflation', 'rises', 'failed']",0.4131060606060606
"Michael Sheringham: A generational family business, a century-long cultural connection - People's Daily Online","Michael Sheringham: A generational family business, a century-long cultural connectionBy Shi Muyang, Yu Ying (People´s Daily Online) 14:04, December 15, 2022 There are very few places in London where one can learn a great deal about Chinese history, and Great Russell Street is one of these places. Of the thousands of visitors who enter the British Museum through its south entrance, few pay much attention to the smaller shops across the street. However, behind the dark wooden door of 41 Great Russell Street is Arthur Probsthain, one of the oldest publishers and dealers specializing in Chinese and African books. In business since 1903, the bookstore is named after its founder and granduncle of Michael Sheringham, an old friend of China, an enthusiast of Chinese literature and a member of a family whose fate has been intertwined with the country for over a century.Born in the mid-1940s and educated at Durham and Cambridge University, Sheringham visited China at the dawn of the diplomatic relationship between China and the UK in 1971. He then went back to China and taught at both Peking University and Shenzhen University, where he married Beijing native Susu, the first international marriage in the history of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Upon Sheringham’s return to the UK, he continued to teach Chinese language and history at various institutions while running the bookstore with his family. The business is now in the hands of Sheringham’s nephews, fourth generation descendants of Arthur Probsthain himself.A novelty of studyPeople’s Daily Online: Both of your parents were experts in Chinese Studies and ran Arthur Probsthain’s, a bookstore specializing in Chinese and African books. How has this family background influenced your upbringing?Sheringham: I think when I was certainly still at school, China was some influence, probably through my father and the bookshop – Arthur Probsthain – which he ran in Bloomsbury in London. And I do remember in school, for instance, I wrote an essay on the geography of China. And that´s about all I knew of China because I had to do some homework on it. So, I think I used one or two books from the bookshop. And of course, apart from the geography, it gave me some background information. So that was school. Then I decided to study Chinese at university, and that again, would be the influence of the bookshop, and my parents’ encouragement. Therefore, I went to Durham University to study Chinese. It was quite a novelty at that time in the sixties.People’s Daily Online: Back in the 1960s, how was Chinese Studies taught at UK universities? Which parts of the programme were you most attracted to? Sheringham: Chinese studies was not as widespread, of course, as it became later. So that´s where I had my basic education in Chinese, really starting with guwen, old Chinese, old Chinese writing, old Chinese characters, and the old classics like Lunyu by Confucius, as you would as a scholar in China for centuries. So, we really did have a pretty traditional kind of Chinese education in Durham. It was a three-year course and very little modern Chinese, but I became more and more interested in the modern from the 19th century history to some extent, the culture.After I graduated from Durham, I had the opportunity to study in Cambridge for a year and it gave me a chance to learn more modern Chinese. Spoken Chinese was not at all part of the curriculum in Durham, and only a few universities did teach it. When I got to Cambridge in 1968, they did have spoken Chinese as part of the course. I did veer towards more interest in the modern Chinese, and I took that with me to Cambridge, but it didn't work out that way for me because it was not part of the course. I was there full of enthusiasm taking some modern Chinese stories with me to, but I had to put that aside, except for one lecturer, who was my delegated individual tutor at King´s College, Martin Bernal.He had already studied at Peking University, and then he came back. He must have been one of the very few, for I never heard of any other scholars or students going to study there at that period. He was very encouraging. I said I'm trying to learn and read modern Chinese literature and modern stories, both to improve my modern Chinese and for my interest. He just let me do that and guided me along. I think Bing Xin was the writer which we chose for me to read with him and he would probably read it aloud. Then when I was writing this M.A. dissertation, I chose the subject, which is Lu Xun’s Views of the Social Function of Literature, a Case Study in Modern Chinese Literary Theory, which I wrote around in 1969 to 1972, and I really enjoyed that. I could really get to know more about the writing and particularly Lu Xun during the May 4th – Wu Si Yun Dong - period, and something of the social and historical background.Michael SheringhamA life of teachingPeople’s Daily Online: Did you have an opportunity to visit China during your studies? On what occasion did that happen?Sheringham: I joined a group visiting China through SACU, the Society of Anglo-Chinese Understanding, which was quite a pioneering visit, of course, in April 1971. And my sister Lesley was on that tour, too. I should just add that my mother had been on the previous tour, which was really the pioneering tour in 1970, the first SACU tour. I was there enjoying this first visit to China and I was very excited and very enlightened. I began to ask whether it would be possible to go back to teach.And then when I got back to the UK, I was teaching those students in the commercial office of the Chinese Embassy and I made friends with them. They passed on the word that I was eager to come back to China to teach. And one person I haven't mentioned yet is Dr Joseph Needham. I think he was the president of SACU at the time, but he was also, of course, based as an academic at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge. He was a formative influence who was encouraging and maybe instrumental in my going to China, to Beijing, Beida (Peking University) to teach in 1972.People’s Daily Online: What was it like to teach in Beijing as a foreigner in the 1970s? Could you please share some details of your life there?Sheringham: First of all, I lived at this very special place, which is very different in a Chinese context. You Yi Bin Guan, the Friendship Hotel in Beijing. That´s a kind of historic place where foreigners were teaching or translating or polishing in the translation in the magazines and so on, where they were settled, generations before and generations afterwards.But there were also long-term foreign dwellers in Beijing who had been there since liberation. I could learn more from them, and they became good friends of mine, such as Pat Adler and Solomon Adler. These were real old friends of China who lived there and were held in quite high esteem. I visited them nearly every week, therefore I tended to branch out. Of course, you know, we also went out for various purposes. I worked every day; I would go to Beida. Also the outings, we would go into the centre of Beijing, Dashilar or the You Yi Shang Dian to go shopping.People’s Daily Online: You and your wife got married in China and you had a daughter. What was it like to have an international family then?Sheringham: Before we were married, Susu graduated in 1973 from Beida and then she told me she was going to Shenzhen University. So we parted ways. I came back to London, but I said, I'll try and get to Shenzhen. When I was in Beijing in about 1980 or 1985, I taught a summer course at Tsinghua University that year through one of the teachers who was responsible for me all those years in Beida, and she arranged for me and a few other foreigners to teach in Shenzhen.Personally, there was a reason because I'd linked up again with Susu, whom I hadn't met for really for so many years. We had just been in touch - corresponding – and it was impossible really to meet. I couldn't believe by the mid-1980s that it was still so difficult and unusual for a foreigner to marry a Chinese. My wife Susu and her family thought it would be easier in Shenzhen. But it´s probably typical and understandable at that time because when we just went into the registration office to get married, the registrar nearly fell off his seat with a very polite huanying (welcome). And he said, ‘I'm sorry. I've never married a foreigner with a native Chinese, so I didn't know what to do’. I had to apply to the Guangzhou authorities because this is really the first unusual situation. I had medical tests that I had to take. There were more problems for me because I was a foreigner.After we were married, our daughter Lily was born in 1986. She was actually born in Beijing. After we finished the teaching and Susu’s work in Shenzhen, we went up to Beijing and Susu gave birth to Lily in the major hospital in Wangfujing. Michael Sheringham A family of connectionPeople’s Daily Online: What did you do upon your return to the UK? How were you involved in UK-China cultural exchanges afterwards?Sheringham: When I came back from China, I taught at the City University and City Literary Institute in Holborn. Westminster University was the polytechnic at that time moved to Euston. I taught Chinese language, modern Chinese history and various other courses. I also taught here in Haslemere by chance, in the adult education scheme that they had around here. I even had 50 people coming to the class at the museum.People’s Daily Online: Next year marks the 120th anniversary of Arthur Probsthain’s. What role does this special connection with China play in your family? Sheringham: It was a generational family business. We were all orientated towards China. My parents both worked really to the end of their lives. My sister, Lesley, went to University of Westminster which was then the Polytechnic of Central London and took Chinese classes. She also worked next to my mother after she left school. Her sons – Tim and Chris – are now running the bookstore and both half-Chinese by their father who is actually a Huaqiao (overseas Chinese) from Hong Kong. They went to Hong Kong to see the relatives there, and they did at least one tour of the mainland together with their parents. They certainly experience that sort of connection.Lily feels much closer to China. I mean she was born and spent three years there and, you know, had a close family connection with Susu’s mother, that´s Lily´s grandma. So, she felt very strong connection and affection. And this very emotional link for Lily was there with Beijing and after studying Law at King´s College London, she had a gap year teaching at Renmin University. And she really enjoyed it. She also went there to do a little bit of training experience in Hong Kong. I think in Lily´s mind, she is always willing to go back to Beijing.So, anybody growing up in our family would be fatally attracted. Or, let´s say they had an atmosphere around them. It was international, very international.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1215/c90000-10184525.html,15,12,2022,"['china', 'sheringham', 'university', 'family', 'beijing', 'modern', 'back', 'online', 'shenzhen', 'susu', 'teach', 'taught', 'married', 'lily', 'london', 'history', 'arthur', 'probsthain', 'durham', 'cambridge']",0.2785670426065163
"Why int'l community doesn't buy into ""Chinese debt trap"" myth - People's Daily Online","Why int'l community doesn't buy into ""Chinese debt trap"" myth (Xinhua) 08:41, January 09, 2023Aerial photo taken on May 6, 2021 shows a view of Sri Lanka´s Hambantota International Port. (Photo by Liu Hongru/Xinhua)How ironic to see that the United States, though touting the Chinese debt trap fallacy in a high voice, holds its tongue on the topic of doing more to help poorer countries address debt burden.BEIJING, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Michael Ondaatje, one of Sri Lanka´s greatest chroniclers, once said, ""In Sri Lanka, a well-told lie is worth a thousand facts.""That seems true in the case of the ""Chinese debt trap"" myth, for which rumormongers frequently single out China´s financing in Sri Lanka´s Hambantota Port.By making a fuss over the Chinese investment and the recipient´s debt troubles, and turning a blind eye to the fact that most of the nation´s debt comes from the West, the propagators attempted to peddle a ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" fallacy and misrepresent the cause of Sri Lanka´s economic woes.The international community doesn't buy into the West´s and particularly Washington´s accusations of the Chinese debt. Instead, ""many countries prefer the engagement with China ... because China is giving them a better option"" with respect to their social models and governance, Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, chief executive officer of the Asian Institute of Eco-civilization Research and Development in Pakistan, told Xinhua.Meanwhile, the Global South is well aware of the ulterior motives of U.S. lies about so-called debt traps, carefully orchestrated to undermine cooperation among developing countries, and to maintain the U.S. hegemony by plundering and manipulating other economies.Sri Lankan Sanjeewa Alwis, a project engineer working at China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC)´s Port City Colombo project, checks the work at a construction site in Colombo´s Port City, Sri Lanka, Nov. 30, 2021. (Xinhua/Tang Lu)""DEBT TRAP"" MYTH DEBUNKEDA widely-circulated factoid goes that Chinese banks offered Sri Lanka predatory loans to build Hambantota Port despite unprofitability of the project, and eventually pushed Sri Lanka into default so that the country had to surrender control to a Chinese firm in exchange for debt relief.All these allegations don't hold water.A recent report by New York-headquartered Liberation News press agency disclosed that an Indian pundit put forth the term in an article in 2017 without actually doing any research. Soon afterwards, some Western media and politicians worked perversely to hype the debt-trap fallacy with concocted stories.In one egregious instance, BBC News edited an interview with Deborah Brautigam, a U.S. scholar who has challenged the falsehood, by deliberately omitting all evidence she cited against it to mislead listeners.In fact, Brautigam, an international political economy professor at Johns Hopkins University, has concluded the debt-trap narrative is just ""a lie, and a powerful one"" after a lengthy research done in collaboration with Meg Rithmire, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. In an article published in the Atlantic in 2021, the academics argued that Chinese creditors are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country.As for the financial plight facing Sri Lanka, data from its Department of External Resources shows that as of 2021, a staggering 81 percent of the country´s foreign debt was owned by U.S. and European financial institutions as well as Western allies Japan and India, in sharp contrast with the mere 10 percent owed to Beijing.""Sri Lanka has 47 percent of its debt in international sovereign bonds, which are the most painful,"" Kasun Kariyawasam, a Sri Lankan economist, told Xinhua, referring to the plurality of his country´s foreign debt owned by Western vulture funds and banks. Empirical evidence proves the claim against China is untrue and based on distorted narratives, he said.""Sri Lanka could sink into the Indian Ocean and most of the Western world wouldn't notice,"" Subhashini Abeysinghe, research director at Colombo-based think tank Verite Research, told Brautigam.Then why did this island country become so prominent in Western politicians' speeches since 2017?With the Belt and Road cooperation in full swing, ""China currently offers an alternative to traditional financing schemes, which has led to more prosperous and realistic development aid."" Western countries see this as a threat and create a discourse to deter developing countries from engaging with China, Argentine economist Pablo Levinton told Xinhua.Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Sabry has lately condemned the ""Chinese debt trap"" narrative as a ""Western phrase.""When Sri Lanka went to China in search of funds, China was respectful and never forced Sri Lanka to take money, he said, adding China also provided Sri Lanka with some financial facilities and credit line, as well as some humanitarian assistance.Train crew Fionah communicates with passengers on a Mombasa-Nairobi Railway passenger train, July 29, 2022. (Xinhua/Dong Jianghui)TRUTH ABOUT CHINESE INVESTMENTThe enthusiasm across the Global South in participating in China-proposed development initiatives has rendered the Western anti-China propagation null.China has signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with 150 countries and 32 international organizations, and the Global Development Initiative has equally won the support of more than 100 countries and international organizations.There are many reasons why Chinese investment has been welcomed. Fundamentally, Chinese development financing is recipient-driven, as ""infrastructure projects are determined by the recipient country, not China, based on their own economic and political interests,"" the above-mentioned Liberation News report observed.Furthermore, China often advances loans at fairly low interest rates, and is willing to restructure the terms of existing loans to be more favorable to the borrowing country, or even forgive loans. As seen in the debt of African countries, the amount owed to Western private lenders is three times what they owe to China, and interest rates on private loans are twice those on Chinese loans, according to a study published in July by British charity Debt Justice.In August 2022, the Chinese government announced it was forgiving 23 interest-free loans in some developing countries, in addition to China´s cancellation of more than 3.4 billion dollars in debt and restructuring of around 15 billion dollars of debt in some developing countries between 2000 and 2019.Many low- and middle-income countries prefer Chinese investment to that from the West, not only because China appears more like a benevolent creditor, but rich countries typically brand developing countries as high risks plus low rewards, and impose onerous conditions that delay project implementation and increase costs.""Western lending tends to extend its conditions beyond loans ... and tends to invest in financial services and other industries related to the service sector,"" Sri Lankan economist Kasun Kariyawasam told Xinhua. In comparison, ""Chinese loans are more flexible and do not include any non-loan conditions,"" and the funds commonly flow into ""real assets that increase the value of the real economy.""Guided by the principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith, and with a commitment to the greater good and shared interests, China endeavors to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries and safeguard the common interests of the developing world, as stated in the report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.From the China-Laos Railway that transformed landlocked Laos into a land-linked hub to Kenya´s Mombasa-Nairobi Railway contributing more than 0.5 percent to the African nation´s economic growth, China has always upheld the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits when partnering with other countries and abstains from internal interference.Kenya is no stranger to the geopolitical games and anti-China narratives alike. Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta sighed that there are always some people who like to point fingers despite the fact that China has sincerely helped Kenya solve problems and meet its needs with actions.Having witnessed the completion of the Chinese-built Kipevu Oil Terminal project in the coastal Kenyan city of Mombasa last year, Kenyatta said he was often asked why Kenya and China cooperate so closely, and he responded that is because China and Kenya respect each other and treat each other as equals.Poll results effectively reflect the Chinese investors' image in the recipients' eyes. A survey released in June by Johannesburg-based think tank The Ichikowitz Family Foundation found that a majority of African youths see China as the most influential and positive foreign player on the continent. The principal reasons they cited for China´s positive influence include affordable Chinese products, Beijing´s investments in local infrastructure and China´s creation of jobs.Photo taken on March 2, 2022 shows the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)REAL CULPRITIn his bestseller ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"" John Perkins suggested that debt trap is nothing new, but in light of its history, the real culprit of virtually every crisis was the United States.The U.S. dollar as the globe´s most dominant currency, Washington´s hegemonic status in the international financial system and the spillover effect of U.S. policies, among other elements, have all contributed to the surge in national debt of developing countries.In a report issued in August, researchers led by Professor Tang Xiaoyang of China´s Tsinghua University found that with encouragement from Western financial institutions, the stock of sovereign bonds of all low- and middle-income countries rose by nearly 400 percent to reach 1,737.2 billion dollars from 2008 to 2020. Now interest payments to these Western institutions account for more than 63 percent of the total interest expenses of the bond-issuing countries.Since the Federal Reserve´s seven straight ""jumbo"" rate hikes in 2022 -- lifting the rates to 4.25-4.5 percent, a 15-year high -- could have dramatically impacted the debt construction or financial stability of these countries, a quite stronger dollar will substantially increase the debtors' repayment burden and eroded their solvency margin.Under such circumstances, many borrowing countries have to issue new bonds with higher interest rates to repay old debt, sliding into a medium- and long-term vicious circle.As the U.S. establishment hunted for prey and squeezed poor countries dry, vulture funds, pawns of U.S. interest groups and the Wall Street, have also set debt traps in developing countries to fill up their own pockets. The distressed debt investors typically buy sovereign debt of countries near or in default at deep discounts, then fiercely litigate to claim full payments and employ all possible tactics to bring debtors to heel.Take Argentina´s 15-year scuffle with Wall Street vultures. In 2001, Argentina defaulted on 100 billion dollars of sovereign bonds and offered debt revamps twice in 2005 and 2010, accepted by about 92 percent of the creditors, while a handful of vulture funds shunned the settlement process and hauled Argentina to U.S. courts, which had jurisdiction over the bonds.Unfortunately, the U.S. federal court in 2014 barred Argentina from repaying other bondholders until it paid the holdout creditors, and forced the country into an agreement in 2016 to pay 4.65 billion dollars, a sum equivalent to nearly 1 percent of Argentina´s GDP that year.To settle a deal alone with NML Capital, a subsidiary of Elliott Management headed by Paul Singer, a mega-donor for the Republican Party, Argentina paid more than 800 million dollars for the bonds the hedge fund spent merely 48 million dollars on -- a return of more than 1,600 percent.Speaking before the UN General Assembly in 2014, then Argentine President Cristina Fernandez accused vulture funds of practicing ""economic and financial terrorism."" It´s even more horrible that the rogue debt collectors who Fernandez said caused ""hunger, misery and poverty"" were supported by the U.S. political establishment.Argentina is by no means the only victim that has fallen prey to traps set by vulture funds.Pierre Jacquemot, who served as the French ambassador to Kenya and Ghana, said at least 32 African countries encountered legal battles with vulture funds over distressed debt issues. His notion was reinforced in a study by Harry Verhoeven at Columbia University and Nicolas Lippolis at the University of Oxford, which found the rise in African debt due to Chinese lending pales in comparison with the debt burden created by private creditors of other countries in the last decade.""Western lenders for long have not been put on the spotlight for debt relief because they successfully managed to dupe the world that it´s only Chinese lenders that pose a threat to Africa,"" Uganda-based Vision Group journalist Mubarak Mugabo said.As a matter of fact, China has extended debt suspension to other developing countries during the pandemic, but private lenders in the West did not, said Tim Jones, head of policy at Debt Justice.How ironic to see that the United States, though touting the Chinese debt trap fallacy in a high voice, holds its tongue on the topic of doing more to help poorer countries address debt burden.""Western leaders blame China for debt crises in Africa, but this is a distraction ... The UK and the U.S. should introduce legislation to compel private lenders to take part in debt relief,"" Jones said.Should those Western countries truly care about the developing world, demonstrate their sincerity to give unflagging support long craved by the indebted countries or simply more concession on debt relief, instead of playing the old trick of ""Chinese debt trap."" Or at least, just stay out of the way of those genuinely lending a helping hand.Clearly, they have neither such noble intention nor honorable deeds in this respect.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0109/c90000-10193205.html,9,1,2023,"['debt', 'china', 'countries', 'sri', 'western', 'lanka', 'developing', 'trap', 'loans', 'country', 'financial', 'funds', 'international', 'interest', 'dollars', 'argentina', 'bonds', 'vulture', 'kenya', 'port']",0.3228303069479542

(Photo by Stephen Chung/Xinhua)The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January.LONDON, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- This January, three years after its departure from the European Union (EU) in 2020, Britain still suffers from division with parliament members continuing to pressure the prime minister on Brexit´s consequences during their weekly conventions.""It´s clear that Brexit and its hold over British politics remains strong,"" noted Sophie Stowers from the academic network UK in a Changing Europe. ""Britain has been split into two distinct camps: 'Leavers' and 'Remainers'.""Brexit chaos has showed no sign of stopping. The divorce has turned out to be long and unpleasant, full of quarrels and distrust, both inside Britain as well as between it and the bloc. As much evidence has showed, the British economy has suffered much, and frustration has grown over the unfulfilled promises. Worse yet, no quick solution is in sight.ECONOMIC TOLL""There´s now a reasonable consensus that the effects of Brexit on the UK economy have been negative,"" Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) told Xinhua. ""It´s more an incremental, small, bit-by-bit, drip-by-drip effect on the British economy. But it´s mainly been in one direction of being negative.""Evidence abounds that both households and businesses have been hit hard. Brexit added an average of 210 pounds (258.4 U.S. dollars) to household food bills in the EU over the two years to the end of 2021, and cost British consumers a total of 5.8 billion pounds (7.1 billion dollars) with higher food bills, research from the LSE Centre for Economic Performance showed in December 2022.A man stands at the entrance of a store in Basingstoke, Britain on Nov. 13, 2022. (Photo by Tim Ireland/Xinhua)""And since low-income households spend a greater share of their income on food than richer families, these Brexit-driven price rises had a proportionately greater impact on the poorest people,"" the study added.Companies have also felt the blow. Nearly half businesses still found Brexit challenging, while only a third could envisage opportunities materializing from Brexit, a report published by the Institute of Directors in November 2022 showed.Businesses said that they have lost clients as a result of Brexit, and that they have had to divert supply chains and relocate to the EU to keep trading, said the report, noting that EU firms are pulling out of Britain as an export market because of the barriers.""Businesses feel they are banging their heads against a brick wall as nothing has been done to help them,"" said Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""The longer the current problems go unchecked, the more EU traders go elsewhere, and the more damage is done.""Brexit has inevitably led to tax rises as well, because a slower-growing economy requires higher taxation to fund public services and benefits, said deputy director John Springford at the think tank Centre for European Reform. If Brexit had not happened, he added, most of the tax rises that the government announced in March 2022 would not have been necessary.A report published by think tank Resolution Foundation in June 2022 found that since 2019, Britain had experienced a sharp decline of 8 percentage points in trade openness, or total trade as a share of GDP. It´s estimated that labor productivity will be reduced by 1.3 percent by the end of the decade due to changes in trading rules alone.While the debate on the impact of Brexit has implied a one-off shock, adjustment will be gradual and create a lasting impact on Britain´s competitiveness and productivity over the coming decade, the report noted.BROKEN PROMISESOne of the illusory promises of Brexit was it would enable Britain to cut quick-and-easy trade deals, but this has not happened with the EU, by far its largest partner, nor with the United States, said John Kampfner from the policy institute Chatham House in a December 2022 article.Photo taken on Dec. 31, 2020 shows a general view of the Port of Dover, following the end of the Brexit Transition Period, in Dover, Britain. (Photo by Tim Ireland/Xinhua)""Considerable effort, and resource, has been expended on devising an independent trade policy. Once again, the results are limited,"" Kampfner noted. ""Much of Brexit´s Global Britain dream was based on reviving deeper relationships with the Commonwealth. Again, this is proving harder than originally envisaged.""The reality is that the vast majority of the 71 deals reached since Brexit are rollover agreements with countries that already had trade agreements with the EU, according to researcher Stephen Hunsaker at the UK in a Changing Europe in January. Even though the existing UK-Japan agreement was slightly modified, analysts cautioned that it will provide no net gain compared to the EU-Japan deal, Hunsaker added.Also, migration was quite a big deal in Brexit debates, but two years on from the end of free movement, the level of net migration certainly has not fallen, said Torsten Bell, chief executive at the Resolution Foundation.Statistics show net migration continued to add to the population in the year ending June 2022, with an estimated 504,000 more people arriving long-term to the UK than departing.""EU migration has decreased sharply, while there has been a substantial increase in non-EU migration. Combined with other factors, this has led to migration overall running at record levels,"" said a report published by UK in a Changing Europe in January.""The new system has seen increases in work visas in the health sector, and some other high-skilled service sectors, while other sectors, such as hospitality, which were previously more dependent on EU workers, are seeing labour shortages,"" it added.Regrets have been growing. The number of Leave voters who think it was wrong for Britain to vote leave the EU has been steadily increasing since 2021, hitting a record 19 percent in November 2022, YouGov data showed, identifying the top reason as ""just a general sense that things have gotten worse since Brexit.""Simon Wolfson, chief executive of the retailer Next, called for more foreign workers in Britain during a recent media interview. It is ""not the Brexit I wanted,"" said the Brexit supporter.CONTINUED CHAOSA dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol, the rules governing post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, has strained Britain´s relations with the EU, even stoking worries of a trade war. Tension grew when the British government in June 2022 introduced a bill to unilaterally change parts of the protocol, which the EU said was not acceptable.A vehicle moves past a border sign near Newry, Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, on June 14, 2022. (Photo by Colum Lynch/Xinhua)Under the protocol, Northern Ireland is part of British customs territory but is subject to the EU´s customs code, value-added tax rules and single market rules for goods. However, a de facto Irish Sea border was thus created between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, meaning goods transported to and from Northern Ireland are subject to border controls.This has elicited firm opposition from Northern Ireland´s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, which has demanded the removal or replacement of the protocol as a precondition for it to sit in the assembly and form a devolved government. Political chaos has continued.The British government´s approach to resolving the problems with the protocol has been counterproductive and has further undermined trust, said Hilary Benn, the Labour Member of Parliament for Leeds Central, in September 2022.""One of the most striking features of Brexit is that those who argued most strongly for it appear unwilling to take any responsibility for its consequences. Nowhere has this been demonstrated more clearly than in the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Benn noted.More recently, with efforts to heal the rifts, progress was made in Britain-EU talks. Nevertheless, gaps remained, and analysts expect a long road ahead for the two sides to settle their disputes.The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January. ""What seems clear, however, is that the relationship is far from settled. Brexit will not be 'done' for a while yet.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0201/c90000-10202028.html,1,2,2023,"['brexit', 'britain', 'eu', 'ireland', 'british', 'northern', 'report', 'added', 'trade', 'migration', 'protocol', 'changing', 'europe', 'january', 'showed', 'years', 'political', 'noted', 'economy', 'businesses']",0.40367875180375185

Peter Cavaciuti: Injecting Chinese artistic spirit into foreign soil - People's Daily Online,"Peter Cavaciuti: Injecting Chinese artistic spirit into foreign soilBy Li Yue, Yu Ying (People´s Daily Online) 15:06, December 21, 2022 Professional artist Peter Cavaciuti has been interested in Chinese painting for decades. He is based in Cambridge, and elsewhere. In the 1970s, he learned Chinese painting in London from Fei Chengwu, the ‘chief disciple’ of Xu Beihong (1895-1953), who is a pioneer of modern Chinese art in the twentieth century. Cavaciuti also went to China to study Chinese art at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing in the 1980s.Cavaciuti has been engaged in teaching for more than 30 years, and has also held exhibitions in the Royal Academy of Arts, the Royal Watercolor Association, as well as in Europe, Asia and other regions. Recently, Cavaciuti´s individual summer exhibition was held by Cam Rivers Publishing, catching the attention of several overseas experts. His continued research and study of Chinese culture and aesthetics, especially Chado (The Way of Tea) and Chan (Zen) Buddhism, have contributed greatly to this field. He is the chairman of the Cambridge Asian Culture Society, and an art teacher at the Cambridge Chinese Community Centre.In this exclusive interview, Cavaciuti showed a foreign artist´s enthusiasm and an alternative interpretation of Chinese painting and Chinese culture based on his learning experience, as well as his understanding and years of experience teaching Chinese painting.Peter CavaciutiEarnest teachings led to special interest in Chinese paintingPeople´s Daily Online: When did you first come across Chinese culture?Cavaciuti: My uncle took me to the British Museum to have a look at Greek and Roman art when I was five. And I first saw Tang sculptures, you know, funerary sculptures. The wonderful lead-glazed camels and horses, and I fell in love with them. So I really loved those, and it was just a natural progression. From there, it grew and grew.People´s Daily Online: You were a student of a Chinese artist, Fei Chengwu, who was the student of Chinese painter Xu Beihong. How did he bring you into the world of Chinese painting, and how did he influence your artworks?Cavaciuti: I was studying at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. I was using the library there and I saw my future teacher’s book Brush Drawing in the Chinese Manner, and I really liked that. So I wrote to Fei Chengwu. And then he brought me into it by being my teacher. Through his guidance, I was led into a totally new world. A wonderful world and a creative world. Also with an apprenticeship in Chinese painting, it’s not like a Western one where you have to sort of express yourself. In Asian art or Chinese art in particular, you’re guided. And it’s all to do with your spirit. Also, I realised that how he’d taught me was Chinese classical painting, but also how you had to develop your own voice. So that was really important – how you look at nature, how you sketch, and you’re more open to things and flexible.People´s Daily Online: You studied in China for a time. Can you share with us your study experience and what it was like when you lived in China in the 1980s?Cavaciuti: Well, intensive study was eight years, and then I was fortunate to study also in Beijing in the Central Academy of Fine Arts so I continued there. It was much, much more than I imagined, because the people were very friendly. I enjoyed it very much. I was able to travel to places I had just copied as landscapes, like the Anhui Province. I went to Huangshan, Guilin, and then I went to Yunnan and travelled around. That really developed my experience. So I was able to see things for myself, with my own eyes. What you should do as a painter is you should read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles.Peter CavaciutiPromoting integration of East and WestPeople´s Daily Online: What do you think are the biggest differences in characteristics between Chinese and Western painting? How are they related to the differences in cultural thinking and understanding?Cavaciuti: For a start, Chinese art is already abstract and already highly formalised and based on calligraphy, based on line. Already, there are things that are so different to Western art, that are inherent in Chinese art. There are no shadows in Chinese painting and the fixed point perspective isn’t used. A line in Chinese art is used as and based on Chinese calligraphy, so it has to be fluid and it has to have movement, and be beautiful in itself. So every line, every dot, has to mean something and also has a relationship with each other. The materials are very different. The brush is held differently, perpendicularly, and you have to accomplish that. The paper is different; the paper is absorbent. You can’t erase things as easily in Chinese paintings as you can in watercolour. Some of the aspects of Chinese art that are more developed are that you can paint on the reverse – with Western watercolours, you can’t do that. I would think the Chinese techniques are really the most difficult in the world!People´s Daily Online: You like Chinese Buddhist culture and East Asian tea culture very much. How has your in-depth study of these fields influenced your painting style and creative thinking?Cavaciuti: I think it’s giving it some more depth and giving it flavour. I think if I just painted, it doesn’t add much; it lacks flavour. I was drawn to Buddhism, Chan or Zen Buddhism, and also a particular practice of tea, Chado. So I’m a practitioner of tea and a tea master, and I teach them as well. That’s helped me a lot: it’s given me another viewpoint, another way of going into things, a whole new area of expression.Peter CavaciutiPlum blossoms everywherePeople´s Daily Online: Many of your students came from the UK and other European countries, so their majors and professional lives involve other fields. They are not artists at all; they are conservators, they are natural scientists – so what makes them interested in learning Chinese painting and art and culture from you? How did you promote and spread this kind of inheritance of Chinese painting in the UK?Cavaciuti: I think a lot of people here – especially in Cambridge – they are curious and obviously intelligent. So they are actually more open-minded to actually absorbing or being introduced to another culture. But that’s one key thing, and the Chinese art, how you approach it: I approach it in a very traditional fashion and so we go step-by-step. The philosophy behind it is important, the techniques are important, so it’s a philosophical, meditative approach. I’m not asking somebody who isn’t a trained artist to create a painting. I’m guiding them how I was guided in how to develop and produce something.I’m very fortunate; I’ve had some students who have been studying with me for over 30 years. They’ve exhibited and they come from different backgrounds, different countries. So one is a natural scientist; he’s a professor at Trinity Hall, a biochemist and very eminent in his field, and he is passionate about painting orchids and he carves seals. He reads Chinese and he is very good – I am very happy with him. And there’s another artist who is American and she is a conservator, and she’s married to an art historian who is very eminent. She’s a very good painter as well. I’ve got many of them. And then I want to start teaching younger people – I had an experience of teaching maybe seven-year-olds, eight-year-olds, and I was really encouraged. I think they’ve got a natural openness to art – Asian or non-Asian, it doesn’t matter – and it’s such a wonderful method for them to explore. People´s Daily Online: In the process of teaching Chinese painting to art students all over the world, you inherit and pass on the artistic spirit and paintings from your teacher Fei Chengwu and Xu Beihong. Can you give some background on this? You mentioned that your teacher believed that coming to the UK is great for spreading, inheriting, and exchanging with other artists.Cavaciuti: And actually, that was really important for Xu Beihong, before the 1940s. That’s why he went to study in Paris and Berlin, and did some research in Germany. He felt that studying Western painting would reinvigorate Chinese art, and my own teacher realised – he came to England to do research and study at the Slade School of Art – he felt the same thing. There are important things that we can learn from the West: painting from life, painting directly, is really important.People´s Daily Online: What are your expectations for your students, and for the future development of Chinese painting and Asian culture overseas?Cavaciuti: I’m really positive. I think already people are very open to different forms of art. The idea that you’re brought up in one particular culture, you don’t have to necessarily follow that. And also the way that the Chinese brush is so expressive and dynamic and abstract falls into place very neatly with Western forms of art. The only thing is, in the past, not many Western artists were educated enough about appreciating good Chinese paintings. If they had had that basis or that understanding, it would really, really help, and to have somebody explain why that painting is good, and why it’s important.I have hosted many exhibitions and workshop in the U.K. and Europe to provide an opportunity to people to understand the historical and cultural background of my works. For instance, Cam Rivers Arts, a gallery based in central Cambridge, has hosted my solo exhibition in the summer of 2022. We hosted a series of tea ceremonies and workshops, which generated lots of interests locally, and globally through promoting the events virtually. I hope more events like this will be hosted in the future. People´s Daily Online: What are your upcoming plans?Cavaciuti: We are setting up a new society called Cambridge Asian Culture Society, to invite people to better understand each other. There’s a new idea come about, promoting not just Chinese culture but Asian culture generally, and this is a really wonderful idea.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1221/c90000-10186730.html,21,12,2022,"['painting', 'art', 'cavaciuti', 'culture', 'online', 'study', 'asian', 'western', 'important', 'based', 'cambridge', 'tea', 'teacher', 'things', 'peter', 'artist', 'teaching', 'experience', 'fei', 'chengwu']",0.35743410405793585

(Photo by Jon Super/Xinhua)Mortgage rates were still over three times higher than they were a year ago, pricing many out of the market, while many more potential buyers would fail lenders' affordability tests, which had become tougher to pass since the central bank has hiked the bank rate, said Gabriella Dickens, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy.At the same time, households' real disposable incomes would be squeezed further in the second quarter by the watering down of government support for energy bills, Dickens added.Earlier this month, a report published by mortgage provider Nationwide Building Society also showed that annual house price growth slowed to 1.1 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December.Month-on-month, January saw a further price fall of 0.6 percent, which left prices 3.2 percent lower than their August peak after taking account of seasonal effects. The monthly decline was the fourth in a row, marking the longest period of consecutive falls since 2009.""Nationwide´s data show that house prices are continuing to buckle under the pressure of elevated mortgage rates, squeezed real incomes and weakened consumer confidence,"" Dickens said.Photo taken on Sept. 2, 2020 shows estate agency signs in Reading, Britain.

UK should stop using BN(O) issue to interfere in China's affairs: Chinese authorities - People's Daily Online,"UK should stop using BN(O) issue to interfere in China´s affairs: Chinese authorities (Global Times) 10:58, February 02, 2023Photo taken on July 14, 2020 shows the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong. [Photo/Xinhua]The Commissioner´s Office of China´s Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong and the Chinese Embassy in the UK slammed the UK side on Wednesday, saying that playing the card of the British National (Overseas) visa, known as the BN(O) scheme, is a shameful act. They urged the British side to stop interfering in China´s internal affairs.Ignoring China´s firm opposition and countermeasures, the UK side has been manipulating the BN(O) matter using the excuse of the National Security Law (NSL) for Hong Kong, blatantly violating relevant agreements between China and the UK and providing protection for anti-China rioters, a spokesperson for the office said. This shows hypocrisy and ill-intentioned efforts to use Hong Kong to contain the Chinese mainland.The latest remarks were made after the UK Home Office said in an official video on Tuesday that ""the UK is proud to have welcomed 144,500 people from Hong Kong since our BN(O) visa launch two years ago.""The Chinese Embassy in the UK also strongly condemned the latest remarks from the British side, saying that the remarks seriously interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China´s internal affairs, trampling on the basic norms of international relations, according to a statement released on Wednesday.The British side insisted on implementing the so-called BN(O) visa scheme under the pretext of the NSL for Hong Kong, seriously violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and relevant agreements between the two sides, the embassy said.China has officially withdrawn its recognition of BN(O) visas as a valid travel and ID document starting from January 31, 2021, as the UK began accepting applications from BN(O)-eligible Hong Kong residents starting on the same day.All the facts have proved that by playing the BN(O) card, the UK is trying to use more Hong Kong people for its political purposes, which shifts the focus from domestic problems, the spokesperson said on Wednesday. Some media reports said that after some Hong Kong residents moved to the UK, they have had a difficult life. There have even been some reports of suicide.The so-called right to ""enjoy life"" is just false rhetoric by the British side, and its hypocrisy is widely known, the spokesperson said. ""The BN(O) scheme is doomed to be another unsustainable performance of hypocrisy.""The tragic death of a 27-year-old Hong Kong master´s graduate, which was suicide according to a coroner´s ruling, shows the difficulties of moving to live in the UK, Hong Kong media outlet The Standard reported on Friday.Fion Ho Yee-king´s death came after seven months of hardship, and this is just the tip of the iceberg, a migrant in London was quoted as saying in the report.The applicants leave Hong Kong for various reasons, such as career advancement, family reunion and settlement, further studies and retirement. Of course, some are also those who participated in and supported the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, Chu Ka Krin, a veteran current affairs commentator based in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""The applicants may still maintain close ties and proximity with Hong Kong, and it does not mean those who leave Hong Kong are abandoning it or that they will never return to their homeland. Application for a BN(O) permit does not mean a loss of confidence in Hong Kong,"" Chu said.Staying in the UK and having affection for Hong Kong are not mutually exclusive, he said. The BN(O) is just a tentative grant to stay in UK and it does not mean right of abode or citizenship.The spokesperson for the Commissioner´s Office urged the UK side to clearly view the general trend and stop using the BN(O) matter to cover up for anti-China rioters and stop interfering in China´s internal affairs.With new ministers and cabinet members appointed in the UK, policies in areas including immigration keep changing and more updates are expected. These affect the immigrants and BN(O) applicants, making their future uncertain, Chu said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0202/c90000-10202441.html,2,2,2023,"['hong', 'kong', 'bn', 'china', 'side', 'affairs', 'british', 'stop', 'office', 'wednesday', 'spokesperson', 'shows', 'embassy', 'visa', 'scheme', 'internal', 'anti', 'hypocrisy', 'remarks', 'applicants']",0.3541116211374831
Report shows nation's 'resilience and determination' - People's Daily Online,"Report shows nation´s 'resilience and determination'By Zhang Chi in Nairobi, Chen Weihua in Brussels, and Xing Yi in London (China Daily) 13:38, March 09, 2023Photo taken on March 6, 2023 shows rows of houses neatly built in Zhenyou community, Xinzhuang township, Suyu district, Suqian, East China´s Jiangsu province. [Photo/People´s Daily Online]The Government Work Report delivered on Sunday to the 14th National People´s Congress demonstrates how the Chinese leadership has responded to the needs, aspirations and dreams of ordinary people, according to African and European commentators.The report by Premier Li Keqiang at the first session of the 14th NPC has also highlighted China´s move to step up its post-pandemic recovery, they said.Dennis Munene, executive director of the China-Africa Center at the Africa Policy Institute, said the report has shown ""the resilience and determination"" of the Chinese government and its people to overcome 21st-century problems.Munene said the government appears to be fully committed to effectively steering the country from the negative impacts of the pandemic, maintaining economic and social stability, and ensuring security in the new and hard-won achievements in its strategic and comprehensive development agenda.China´s successes in maintaining overall stable economic performance while overcoming great challenges amid a complex and fluid environment are rooted in its governing principle of putting people first, including avoiding the deadly waves of COVID-19 and eliminating absolute poverty as scheduled by 2020, he said.Carlos Martinez, a British commentator and co-editor of Friends of Socialist China, said it´s ""particularly striking how in tune the Chinese leadership is with the needs, aspirations and dreams of ordinary people"".""Li Keqiang´s concerns are the same as those of the people,"" he said. ""The report discusses the impact of the pandemic on China´s economy over the last three years,"" he said, underscoring that the resolute measures taken to protect lives had an inevitable impact on economic activity — although this was managed well overall, and didn't interfere with China´s world-historic achievement of eliminating absolute poverty once and for all.Now that China has adapted its COVID-19 management strategy in accordance with changed circumstances, he said, it´s likely that China will return to moderate growth while keeping inflation at a low level and ensuring that income levels increase proportionally with the overall economy.Kayode Ogunbunmi, publisher of the Lagos-based newspaper City Voice, said the Government Work Report has revealed why China has a ""well-deserved reputation as a pillar of global stability and is an engine of economic growth for the world"".""The report, though delivered primarily to the Chinese audience, should also make for educational reading for leaders across the globe — and especially for those on the African continent. For us in Africa, the report should serve as a manual on the merits of economic planning, focused leadership and faithful execution of laid down plans,"" Ogunbunmi said.Keith Bennett, deputy chairman of the 48 Group Club, a London-based organization that promotes trade between China and the UK, said it is better for China ""to set a modest target and beat it than set an over ambitious target but not live up to it"".""Considering the size of the Chinese economy, even the modest target would be a great achievement,"" Bennett said, adding that China´s opening-up and its economic growth and development are ""beneficial to the rest of the world"".""From what I learned through the Chinese Chamber of Commerce UK, there is a wide range of sectors in which China is already investing in the UK, and I'm impressed by the socially responsible nature of much of that investment in terms of the emphasis on renewables and sustainability and environmentally friendly industries,"" he said.Gerald Mbanda, a Rwandan researcher and publisher on China and Africa, said the work report highlighted positive economic growth after the disruption of the global economy by the pandemic.""The increase in investment in infrastructure and manufacturing over the years has seen the rise of China as the second-largest economy in the world.

"UK-China trading momentum to continue this year, say experts - People's Daily Online","UK-China trading momentum to continue this year, say experts (Xinhua) 10:46, February 18, 2023LONDON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- As China was among the United Kingdom´s (UK) largest trading partners in 2022 and with a steady increase in bilateral trade flows, experts are confident that this momentum will continue in 2023.The UK´s trade with China has continued to flourish, which reflects the strong and deep trade relationship between the two countries, John McLean, chair of the Institute of Directors (IoD) London, has told Xinhua in a recent written interview.In particular, services exports have increased, which is a testament to the UK´s financial and insurance expertise and a reflection of the growing opportunities that now exist in China, McLean said.Since China is among the UK´s largest export markets, the UK benefits as more exports equal more jobs, which is good for the country´s economy, McLean said.UK-China trade in goods also increased in 2022, as China was the second largest trading partner in goods imports for the UK and the fifth largest in goods exports, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said earlier this month.""With the opening up of travel and a resulting increase in people-to-people exchanges, I expect the overall UK exports to China to continue to grow,"" he noted, adding that he was ""optimistic"" that ""the trade engagement between China and the UK will strengthen"" this year.This week in London, McLean, also chair of the UK-China Business Development Center, welcomed a delegation from the Chinese coastal city of Ningbo, which he said was an opportunity to strengthen business ties between the two sides.In his welcome speech, McLean noted that over the last three years affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, ""we are now entering calmer COVID waters and for the UK it is now time to refresh our engagement with China and positively progress our bilateral relationship.""With UK´s ""strengths in finance, technology and innovation"" and Ningbo´s ""developed economy and active international engagement"" as ""a vibrant city with a first-class port"", he said, ""We are full of confidence in continuing to promote cooperation between the UK and Ningbo.""Gordon C.K. Cheung, associate professor in international relations of China at Durham University, said he was also confident in the two countries' trade ties.One way to understand the increase in UK exports to China was the impact of Brexit on UK´s trade with the European Union (EU), Cheung told Xinhua in a written interview. ""The UK is trying to export more goods and services to China to compensate for the loss on the EU front.""On the other hand, he added, although the geopolitical drumbeat was noticeable between the UK and China last year, the reality was that businesspeople were putting their money where their mouths were, and that was reflected clearly in the trading data.Given that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already revised China´s economic growth rate to 5.2 percent in 2023, the country´s purchasing power should increase and therefore trade between the UK and China should improve in 2023, Cheung said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209526.html,18,2,2023,"['china', 'trade', 'mclean', 'exports', 'trading', 'largest', 'increase', 'goods', 'continue', 'london', 'engagement', 'ningbo', 'international', 'cheung', 'momentum', 'experts', 'bilateral', 'confident', 'relationship', 'countries']",0.3379935720844811
The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils - People's Daily Online,"The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils (Xinhua) 17:04, February 03, 2023BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its PerilsFebruary 2023ContentsIntroductionI. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm JurisdictionII. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm JurisdictionIII. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm JurisdictionConclusionIntroductionThe United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, including both its allies and countries with which it has hostile or strained relations. In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with U.S. ""arms"" stretching longer and longer. Examining cases of U.S. abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.I. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction◆According to U.S. domestic law, long-arm jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over persons or entities domiciled or resident outside the territory of the sanctioning state. First established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945), long-arm jurisdiction allows state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction in civil and commercial cases where jurisdiction cannot be exercised because the defendant is not domiciled in the state, on the basis that the defendant has some ""minimum contacts"" with the state.◆According to international law, the exercise of a country´s jurisdiction over an extraterritorial person or entity generally requires that the person or entity or its conduct has a real and sufficient connection to that country. Yet the U.S. exercises long-arm jurisdiction on the basis of the ""minimum contacts"" rule, constantly lowering the threshold for application. Even the flimsiest connection with the United States, such as having a branch in the United States, using U.S. dollar for clearing or other financial services, or using the U.S. mail system, constitutes ""minimum contacts.""◆To exercise long-arm jurisdiction, the United States has further developed the ""effects doctrine,"" meaning that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever an act occurring abroad produces ""effects"" in the United States, regardless of whether the actor has U.S. citizenship or residency, and regardless of whether the act complies with the law of the place where it occurred. The United States has also been expanding the scope of its long-arm jurisdiction to exert disproportionate and unwarranted jurisdiction over extraterritorial persons or entities, enforcing U.S. domestic laws on extraterritorial non-US persons or entities, and wantonly penalizing or threatening foreign companies by exploiting their reliance on dollar-denominated businesses, the U.S. market or U.S. technologies.◆In essence, long-arm jurisdiction is an arbitrary judicial practice, wielded by the U.S. government on the strength of its national power and financial hegemony, to enforce extraterritorial jurisdiction over entities and individuals of other countries on the ground of its domestic law.II. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction◆In the many years of exercising such jurisdiction, the United States has gradually developed a massive, mutually reinforcing and interlocking legal system for long-arm jurisdiction, and continued to lower the threshold and expand its discretionary power, thus shaping long-arm jurisdiction into a tool for the United States to advance hegemonic diplomacy and pursue economic interests. Such practice disregards other countries' sovereignty, blatantly meddles in others' internal affairs, seriously damages the legitimate interests of other countries, and disrupts the normal order of international exchanges. The expansion of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is all-dimensional. Citing the ""minimum contacts"" rule and the ""effects doctrine,"" the United States has developed massive and complex legal and enforcement systems to support its long-arm jurisdiction which is expanding in scope and fields of application.◆ Long-arm jurisdiction has also become a means by which the United States abuses unilateral sanctions, especially secondary sanctions. To ensure the extraterritorial effects of U.S. sanction laws, the United States would usually exercise judicial authority to hold extraterritorial entities and individuals accountable for failing to comply with U.S. sanction laws. In addition to long-arm jurisdiction, administrative, economic, financial and other means would also be employed to implement its secondary sanctions.◆Compulsory extraterritorial evidence collection is another important means of long-arm jurisdiction. In the judicial process involving other countries, the United States frequently takes unilateral compulsory measures to collect evidence outside its own territory, circumventing normal channels of judicial and law enforcement cooperation between countries. It would directly ask banks and Internet firms that have branches or are listed in the United States to provide evidence such as account information and data located outside the United States. When other countries try to raise démarche, the United States would always respond by citing excuses such as ""judicial independence"" or ""low efficiency in normal judicial assistance or law enforcement cooperation."" These typical examples of long-arm jurisdiction have severely damaged other countries' judicial sovereignty, and the legitimate rights and interests of those subjects of evidence collection.◆The United States has put in place a whole-of-government system to practice long-arm jurisdiction, which features a division of labor among departments and inter-agency collaboration. The President and Congress are the main decision makers when it comes to sanctions. The President decides on most of the economic sanctions, and Congress participates through legislative activities under specific circumstances. At the heart of sanctions enforcement is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency under Treasury responsible for freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction, formulating and adjusting lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, and reviewing and issuing licenses. The Department of State´s Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) is responsible for developing and implementing foreign policy-related sanctions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), an agency of the Department of Commerce, administers separate lists from the OFAC. On top of these, the U.S. government bolsters its sanctions enforcement through control of SWIFT and CHIPS, two major cross-border payment and clearing systems, by pressing them, when it deems necessary, to cut off contact with the financial institutions of the subject country to achieve the purpose of economic sanctions.◆The United States has stepped up legislation for long-arm jurisdiction. A wide range of laws in the United States advance long-arm jurisdiction, including Trading with the Enemy Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Countering America´s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and Helms-Burton Act. Others such as the USA PATRIOT Act and National Defense Authorization Act contain long-arm jurisdiction clauses. A number of presidential executive orders also involve long-arm jurisdiction. More and more U.S. federal legislation contains long-arm jurisdiction clauses to prevent Americans from circumventing U.S. laws by establishing subsidiaries in foreign countries, or foreigners enjoying less restrictions than Americans, or relevant international rules-making hurting U.S. interests. These legislative moves allow the United States to enforce long-arm jurisdiction in its diplomacy by citing domestic laws.◆ There is a growing tendency of the U.S. applying long-arm jurisdiction to criminal cases, which is an extreme abuse of the practice. In recent years, a number of U.S. federal laws include extraterritorial clauses, which have been exploited by the Department of Justice to launch criminal investigations and prosecutions. In these proceedings, federal courts begin to apply the concept of long-arm jurisdiction when examining the basis of their jurisdiction by broadly interpreting the connection between the case and the United States, expanding the scope of personal and territorial jurisdiction, and lowering the threshold for the application of protective jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.III. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction◆The United States is the only sanctions superpower in the world. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021,the number of active U.S. sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400.◆Sanctions strain relations between countries and undermine the international order. Healthy state-to-state relations are the bedrock for peace and stability in the international order. In the 1990s, the United States introduced the Helms-Burton Act to impose economic sanctions through long-arm jurisdiction on individuals and entities worldwide conducting transactions with Cuba. It sparked strong opposition from the European Union, who in 1996 passed the Blocking Statute to neutralize through legislation the effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction within the EU, and enable individuals and entities in the EU to sue individuals and entities in the United States. Apart from this, the EU put forward a series of proposals and initiatives at the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the World Trade Organization and other international bodies, calling on the international community to pay attention to the harmful effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction, and even resorted to the WTO dispute settlement procedures. So far, the ""long arm"" of U.S. jurisdiction has reached China, Russia, Iran, Syria, the DPRK, Cuba, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, among others. In an article published in Foreign Affairs, Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University criticized successive U.S. administrations for abusing economic coercion and economic violence and using sanctions as the preferred solution to diplomatic problems, which have been ineffective and causing humanitarian disasters.◆Since 1979, the United States has imposed various types of unilateral sanctions on Iran and other countries. In 1996, it rolled out the D'Amato Act which forbids foreign companies from investing in the energy sector of Iran and Libya, resulting in long-term damaging ramifications. Afterward, the United States keeps ramping up sanctions against Iran. Under the Trump administration, it harbored a policy of ""maximum pressure"" and wanted to use sanctions to effect a regime change in Iran. According to then Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, sanctions under the Trump administration caused at least US$200 billion worth of economic damage to Iran; he condemned such sanctions as inhumane, a crime and an act of terrorism.◆Between 1980 and 1992, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on Libya, and from 1992 to 2003, it rallied or coerced allies into expanding sanctions against Libya. The World Bank noted that Libya suffered up to US$18 billion economic losses as a result of the sanctions, while an official Libyan estimate put the figure at 33 billion.◆Crude U.S. sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf War brought about serious consequences. From August 1990 to May 2003, they caused a total loss of US$150 billion in Iraq´s oil revenue. As a result, the country´s per capita income falls below its 1990 level of US$7,050 even to this day. The sanctions have also caused a serious humanitarian disaster, with infant mortality rate doubling and the under-five mortality increasing six-fold. Meanwhile, Iraq´s education, health and social security systems were destroyed; its literacy rate fell from 89 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 1997.◆Undermining the purposes and functions of various international governance mechanisms. The United States has frequently imposed unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce and other agencies imposed various sanctions on as many as over 2,000 entities. As a result, the sanctioning function of the Security Council is undercut, seriously affecting its normal function of maintaining international peace and security. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) attempted to investigate suspected war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the United States, with itself not being a member of the Court, responded by launching sanctions against ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and senior official Phakiso Mochochoko, sparking unanimous outcry from the international community. Despite the ruling of the Dispute Settlement Body of WTO that its Section 301 procedures are a violation of international law, the United States continues to launch various unilateral Section 301 investigations on imports from China and other countries, and keeps all existing Section 301 tariffs unchanged. Such actions have directly sabotaged the tariff concessions achieved by many rounds of difficult negotiations of the multilateral trading system, blatantly trampled on the purposes and spirit of the multilateral trading system, and eroded the cornerstone of the system´s operation.◆Undermining the interests of companies of other countries. To maintain its economic and technological supremacy, the United States abuses its public power to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition. Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and fighting against human rights violations, it has adopted a package of measures including the Entity List and economic sanctions to restrict foreign enterprises from obtaining raw materials, items and technologies vital to their survival and development, sometimes even used secondary sanctions to cut those companies' normal trade with enterprises from other countries in an effort to disrupt their supply chains root and branch.◆A case in point is the imprisonment of a senior manager from the French company Alstom. In 2013, in order to beat Alstom in their business competition, the United States applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to arrest and detain Frédéric Pierucci on charges of bribing foreign officials. He was further induced to sign a plea deal and provide more evidence and information against his company, leaving Alstom no choice but to accept General Electric´s acquisition, vanishing ever since from the Fortune 500 list. The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has become a tool for its public power to suppress competitors and meddle in normal international business activities, announcing the United States’ complete departure from its long-standing self-proclaimed champion of liberal market economy.◆In recent years, the United States has frequently employed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (2016) to impose unilateral sanctions on entities in various countries deemed to have engaged in ""serious human rights violations."" However, while exercising such unilateral sanctions, the United States has often violated the basic human rights of the sanctioned subjects disregarding the fact that their human rights are also entitled to protection.◆When COVID-19 was raging in the world, the U.S. government did not relent in imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran, Syria and other countries, making it difficult for these countries to obtain the much-needed medical supplies to fight the virus. As a result of the sanctions, Iran has been cut off access to essential medicines and medical equipment, putting the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy. To raise funds to fight the pandemic, the Iranian government applied to the IMF for a US$5 billion dollar exclusive loan, but the effort was blocked by the United States. Even worse, the United States prevented Iran from importing COVID vaccines by freezing its overseas funds and threatening vaccine suppliers. As the Brookings Institution estimated, during the height of the pandemic in Iran, U.S. sanctions further exacerbated the spread of the virus and could have caused up to 13,000 of deaths.ConclusionThe U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is not something new. In spite of adaptations over time in its contents and measures, the nature of the U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has not changed: it has been, since the very beginning, a hegemonic tool to maintain U.S. hegemony, suppress foreign competitors, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and even subvert the governments of other countries. Over the last few years, the United States has abused long-arm jurisdiction by continuing to lower the threshold and intensifying measures to an unprecedented degree against wider range of targets. It not only undermines the principle of sovereign equality, violates international law, and erodes the multilateral order with the UN at its core, but also creates and intensifies tensions and conflicts among major countries, and poses a threat to the international security system established after World War II.

These are: to halve inflation; to grow the economy; to reduce national debt; to cut hospital waiting lists; and to stop illegal migrant boats crossing the English Channel.Calling these the ""people´s priorities,"" Sunak vowed to ""work night and day"" to deliver for the British people.Britain´s new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak waves to the crowd after delivering his first address to the nation outside 10 Downing Street in London, Britain, Oct. 25, 2022. (Xinhua/Li Ying)He said his government will halve inflation this year to reduce the cost of living and give people financial security. According to official figures, the UK´s annual inflation dipped to 10.7 percent in November from 11.1 percent in October.Last November, the Bank of England (BoE) said it expected the country´s consumer price index (CPI) to drop sharply after the middle of 2023.To grow the economy, Sunak pledged to create better-paid jobs and opportunities across the country. However, this may prove to be an uphill task.According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK´s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.3 percent in the third quarter of 2022. The BoE also warned that the country´s economy is bound to remain in recession throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, and GDP will recover only gradually thereafter.Photo taken on March 23, 2022 shows British coins in Basingstoke, Britain. (Photo by Tim Ireland/Xinhua)Reducing public debt has always been a priority for Sunak´s fiscal policies since he took office in late October. In his Autumn Statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a package of tax hikes and spending cuts in a bid to improve the public finances and restore the country´s economic credibility.In Sunak´s fourth pledge, he promised that the waiting lists of the National Health Service (NHS) will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly. According to the British Medical Association (BMA), in October 2022, a record 7.21 million people were waiting for medical treatment in the UK.Sunak also vowed to pass new laws to curb the arrival of migrants in ""small boats,"" on the country´s coast. ""If you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed,"" he said.Migrants arrive on a beach in Dungeness, Britain on Nov. 24, 2021.

Meanwhile, presenters in both Chongqing and London explained the dishes.Amira Arasteh, a food journalist working in London, told Xinhua the Mao Xue Wang (assorted meats in hot sauce) and La Zi Ji (fragrant chicken with chilies) she tried were ""very spicy,"" but had ""lots of flavor.""The famous dishes from the city of Chongqing, southwest China, are known for their ability to fight the adverse physiological effects of humidity.

Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses - People's Daily Online,"Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses (Xinhua) 13:39, February 05, 2023LONDON, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat to global public health, the World Health Organization (WHO) last month calls for the momentum for vaccination to be maintained to better cover high-priority groups.The vaccine uptake in low- and middle-income countries is still insufficient, which became a concern about the ongoing risk, according to the WHO.The world has been struggling to tackle the problem of unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between rich and lower-income countries. Yet, years after the outbreak of the pandemic, promises made by many rich countries have yet to be delivered.""No one is safe until everyone is safe,"" said Seth Berkley, CEO of the global vaccine alliance Gavi.EMPTY PROMISESAccording to figures from Our World in Data, as early as two years ago, developed countries had already acquired enough doses to vaccinate their population more than one shot for each. But even now, many Western developed countries have not yet fulfilled their promises to deliver vaccines to low-income countries.There are currently nearly 400 million doses of vaccines announced by the United States but not yet donated, according to the data. For the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the number is 41 million and 6.2 million.Commenting on the low vaccination rates in low-income countries, Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, told Xinhua in an earlier interview that ""the delay in vaccines getting to them has really been intolerable.""Last month at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland, Hatchett urged countries and manufacturers to prioritize vaccine supply to the global program COVAX.VACCINES DESTROYEDAccording to a report by qz.com last October, Canada destroyed nearly 14 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses in early 2022. Switzerland was also reported to destroy more than 14 million doses of vaccines, which was more than four times the doses it donated to low-income countries.What also worsened the global accessibility of vaccines is that some low-income countries had to turn down the offering of vaccine doses that were due to expire soon, or had to destroy such doses.In May 2021, Malawi destroyed nearly 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, which arrived in the country at the end of March but would expire on April 13.In an article published in the Sunday Mirror newspaper in 2021, WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing Gordon Brown said the West´s stockpile of COVID-19 vaccine is growing by the day but many poorer parts of the world are missing out.""We must act now,"" said the former British prime minister.IMMUNITY GAPThe obvious gap between immunity in rich and poorer countries has drawn the attention of many experts. Many have warned that the longer the unequal vaccine distribution exists, the wider COVID-19 spreads, and new variants are more likely to emerge.Extremely unequal vaccine distribution has typified the availability of vaccines across countries, said a study published in August 2022 in the UK journal Communications Medicine. ""In an unequal world with open economies, pandemics do not stop at national borders,"" it stressed.Since about 85 percent of the global population resides in low- and middle-income countries, most of humanity remains exposed to continued outbreaks, the study said, adding that this situation increases the risk that further virus variants will emerge, possibly undermining the efficacy of existing vaccines.Most people in the world´s poorest countries might not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until at least mid-2023, it said.""We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world´s population, not just the wealthy parts,"" said Berkley.As long as large portions of the world´s population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged, he said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0205/c90000-10203404.html,5,2,2023,"['countries', 'vaccines', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'global', 'low', 'income', 'covid', 'million', 'unequal', 'population', 'variants', 'pandemic', 'health', 'distribution', 'rich', 'switzerland', 'accessibility', 'urged', 'western']",0.36093130855035616

[Photo/Xinhua]The search volume of international flight tickets is surging in China after the country announced to downgrade the management of COVID-19 from Jan 8, the news website chinanews.com reported on Tuesday.According to the online travel agency Qunar, the international flight ticket search volume increased sevenfold within 15 minutes after the new COVID-19 management measures were announced, and the hot destinations are Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.Data from another online travel platform Ctrip showed that the search volume to popular overseas destinations increased tenfold year-on-year compared with the same period of last year within 30 minutes after the information was announced. Moreover, the search volume of outbound flight tickets and hotels reached a three-year high.Some hot tourism destinations search volume saw a rapid growth for the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, which falls on Jan 21 to 27 next year. The top 10 hot destinations are Macao, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, the US, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and the UK, according to Ctrip.The tourism service provider ly.com said the search volume of international flight tickets jumped 850 percent, and the visa service search volume grew tenfold after the information was announced. Japan, South Korea, and Thailand are the top 3 overseas destinations to Chinese tourists. The hot outbound flight destinations are Bangkok, Tokyo, Seoul, Los Angeles and Singapore.The search users to outbound tourism are mainly from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, said the ly.com.The Chinese mainland customers' average spending to outbound flight tickets and high-end hotels increased by 64 percent and 40 percent during nearly half a year, compared with the same period before the COVID-19 epidemic, said Ctrip.With tourism supply-side recovery, and inflation control in major economies , the overall price of international flight tickets and outbound hotels is expected to fall back; however, due to the supply-side facilities, and manpower recovery still exists short-term constraints, the price needs time to fall, said the chinanews.com, citing Fang Zeqian, an industry analyst at Trip.com Group.As the new COVID-19 management measures implementing, and the airline operating capacity recovering, the summer vacation of 2023 may usher in the peak of entry and exit, said the chinanews.com, citing Lan Xiang, director of Qunar´s data research department.Moreover, visa service still has constraints in short-time, said the Ctrip.

Nation can help cool soaring global inflation - People's Daily Online,"Nation can help cool soaring global inflationBy OUYANG SHIJIA (China Daily) 08:15, February 03, 2023An Indian customer shops at a toy store on Thursday at Yiwu International Trade City in Yiwu, Zhejiang province. The complex, the world´s biggest small-commodities market, reopened after closing for the Spring Festival holiday in late January. HUANG ZONGZHI/XINHUAStable prices provide room for more policy easing to shore up economyChina, with its benign inflation rate, is capable of playing a pivotal role in helping cool soaring global inflation and will continue to ensure strong economic recovery and mild price fluctuations this year, analysts and executives said.In marked contrast to major advanced economies, which have been plagued by surging inflation amid rising energy and food prices, China has seen its inflation levels remain low and stable, which, analysts said, provides space for further policy easing to shore up the world´s second-largest economy.""Over the past year, many advanced economies witnessed the biggest surge in inflation in 40 years,"" said Liu Zhicheng, director of commodity market division at the Academy of Macroeconomic Research´s market and price research institute. The academy is affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, China´s top economic regulatory body.Last year, a number of developed economies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, experienced inflationary whiplash. During the first 11 months of 2022, the inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, was 8 percent in the United States, 8.4 percent in the eurozone and 8.9 percent in the UK, sparking public complaints and protests. Some developing countries have also suffered from high inflation.Both the Bank of England, Britain´s central bank, and the European Central Bank were expected to raise interest rates on Thursday to tame high inflation, ease the cost-of-living crisis and avoid falling into recession. The US Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday.China has had a good record of keeping its overall price levels low and stable. Last year, the country´s consumer price index rose by 2 percent year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, which was well below the country´s inflation control target of around 3 percent.Notably, China´s food inflation rate was 2.8 percent and the cost of water, electricity and fuel rose a modest 3 percent in 2022, both significantly lower than in major Western economies, Liu said.He attributed soaring inflation across the globe to runaway energy and food prices amid geopolitical tensions and the massive fiscal and monetary easing measures in many Western countries.China has managed to deal with imported inflationary pressures with effective measures focused on stabilizing prices of products essential for people´s livelihood as well as bulk commodities.""China´s stable price levels are creating an environment that keeps economic performance stable, which also helps tame global inflation,"" Liu said.While warning of headwinds from imported inflationary pressures and potential fluctuations in commodity prices, Wan Jinsong, director of the NDRC´s Department of Price, said China has solid foundations as well as the confidence and capabilities to maintain overall price stability in 2023.Wan said at a recent news conference that the country has sufficient supplies of goods essential for people´s livelihood, a stable energy supply and an improved system for ensuring price and supply stability.""Compared with the dramatic inflation surges much of the world has experienced, China has continued to have low inflation due to weak domestic demand and government measures to stabilize prices and supplies,"" said Zhou Maohua, an analyst at China Everbright Bank.NBS data showed China´s CPI grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year in December, while the inflation rate in the US was 6.5 percent in the same month.Zhou estimated that China´s CPI will remain at a moderate level this year given the gradual pickup in demand and the country´s sufficient supply of daily necessities.""Unlike many other economies, China has not adopted massive policy stimulus over the past few years,"" he said. ""Given its stable inflation levels, the country has ample room and plenty of policy tools in reserves to support the economy.""Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said that his team thinks inflation is not a major concern for China in 2023, and they expect the policy stance to remain accommodative.A top government think tank forecast that China´s consumer inflation will stay mild in 2023, while cautioning that the risk of price increases beyond expectations still remains.The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Center for Forecasting Science estimates that China´s CPI will rise about 1.8 percent in 2023, while the producer price index will decline by about 0.4 percent.Gao Ruidong, chief macroeconomist at Everbright Securities, warned that the robust recovery in consumption of services may add to ""structural inflation pressures"".China is taking a more pro-growth stance, giving priority to expanding domestic demand and spurring consumption. The local governments have mapped out detailed plans in an attempt to put growth back onto the fast track.On Tuesday, the Beijing Municipal Government released a document on key tasks for 2023, urging more efforts to boost consumption, including spurring consumption in housing, new energy vehicles and elder care.There have been initial signs of recovery in consumption thanks to such policies in other provincial-level regions.In Guangdong province, Guangzhou´s Beijing Road shopping area achieved a business turnover of 345 million yuan ($51.3 million) in the weeklong Spring Festival holiday, up 19.4 percent year-on-year, official data showed.Gao said in an article published in China Finance magazine that the country will also likely see a notable rebound in consumption of services, such as transportation, catering, accommodation and entertainment, and prices for services will go up in the post-COVID period.He said the government should take more steps to keep prices stable, with a key focus on ensuring the supply of food and energy, assisting companies to stabilize employment and promoting the rebound of services industry.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0203/c90000-10202729.html,3,2,2023,"['china', 'inflation', 'price', 'prices', 'stable', 'country', 'consumption', 'policy', 'rate', 'economies', 'energy', 'food', 'levels', 'bank', 'supply', 'government', 'services', 'soaring', 'global', 'market']",0.41803957946815096

West should immediately stop interfering in political manipulation of HK's judicial proceedings: Chinese FM commissioner - People's Daily Online,"West should immediately stop interfering in political manipulation of HK´s judicial proceedings: Chinese FM commissioner (Global Times) 08:36, February 08, 2023Photo taken on June 29, 2020 shows a billboard on the Law of the People´s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in Central area in Hong Kong, south China. Photo:XinhuaThe Commissioner´s Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) expressed strongly disapproval and firm rejection on Tuesday to the irresponsible remarks made by some groups and members of the US Congress concerning HKSAR courts' trial of the Hong Kong 47 case. They slandered the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong, and interfered in its judicial proceedings.The Chinese side urged the US politicians to stop their twisted political show immediately, as they flagrantly denigrated the human rights and rule of law in Hong Kong and interfering in its normal judicial system, a spokesperson of the office said in a statement.A National Security Law trial of 47 opposition figures began on Monday in Hong Kong, drawing widespread attention both locally and overseas. The ultimate intention of these suspects was to take power in HKSAR by using loopholes in the city´s electoral system and to seek independence by colluding with external forces, according to media reports.Prosecutors on Monday began explaining their basis for accusing the 47 suspects of conspiracy to commit subversion, in the high-profile case.Representatives from the UK, the US, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, European Union and France were also among those queuing up outside the court on Monday, according to the Guardian.Laurence Vandewalle from the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macau, said the EU had been observing trials across the world ""as a sign of commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law"", the report noted.The Commissioner´s Office spokesperson pointed out that before the nomination of candidates for the Seventh Legislative Council of the HKSAR (LegCo) in 2020, those anti-China elements in Hong Kong had conspired to organize a ""primary election"" and fabricate public opinions in an attempt to seize control of the LegCo.In so doing, they sought to paralyze the SAR Government and pressure both the Central and the SAR governments, said the spokesperson, adding that such a despicable plot not only jeopardized the democratic electoral system stipulated in the Basic Law of the HKSAR, but is also suspected of committing the crime of subversion under the National Security Law for the HKSAR.Enforcing laws and holding lawbreakers accountable is the core tenet of the rule of law. No one has the privilege to be above the law, and no rights and freedoms should cross the bottom line of national security. This is not only an explicit provision of relevant international conventions, but also a legal practice among all countries.However, some politicians from a few countries insist on hypocrisy and double standards, repeatedly interfere in the judiciary of the HKSAR, and put political manipulation above the law. Without caring about democratic chaos in their own countries, they vilified the National Security Law for the HKSAR, sugarcoated anti-China forces in Hong Kong as ""fighters for freedom,"" and meddled with the judiciary of the SAR, the spokesperson noted.The spokesperson stressed that the rule of law is a cornerstone of Hong Kong´s prosperity and stability, and ""one country, two systems"" has always been upheld based on the rule of law. Since the implementation of the National Security Law, public order in Hong Kong has been restored, the legal principles upheld, development back on track and the rights and freedoms of local residents better protected.The spokesperson said that in the face of the historical trend of Hong Kong moving from chaos to stability and prosperity, Western politicians can never get their way in disrupting the city by interfering in the judiciary of the SAR. No external forces can dampen the legal foundation in Hong Kong or the confidence of the international community in Hong Kong´s rule of law, nor can they impact our strong determination to safeguard ""one country, two systems"" and national security.""We urge Western politicians to put themselves in the right position, recognize the reality, earnestly respect the spirit of the rule of law, and immediately stop interfering in and damaging the judicial system of Hong Kong,"" the spokesperson said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0208/c90000-10204649.html,8,2,2023,"['law', 'hong', 'kong', 'hksar', 'rule', 'national', 'security', 'spokesperson', 'rights', 'interfering', 'judicial', 'china', 'office', 'politicians', 'system', 'sar', 'immediately', 'stop', 'political', 'commissioner']",0.2719095719095718

Abnormal for West to dodge Nord Stream explosive revelations - People's Daily Online,"Abnormal for West to dodge Nord Stream explosive revelationsBy Global Times editorial (Global Times) 08:41, March 02, 2023Illustraion: Liu Rui/GTCan you throw a big stone into the water without causing any waves? Of course not. After US' veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published his report ""How America Took Out The Nord Stream Pipeline"" on February 8, he encountered an even more abnormal anomaly. Instead of a stone, the report is a heavy bomb, but it seemed to have been thrown into a black hole of public opinion. As the saying goes, if there is an abnormality, there will be a demon, and this time is no exception.The US made a simple and rude denial when the report was first released. After that, it has kept silent. European countries, as stakeholders, have mostly shunned commenting on the matter. The oddest phenomenon is that the US mainstream media, which have been very sensitive to all kinds of clues, have maintained collectively silent. In response, Hersh himself expressed disappointment, pointing out that not one of them has written a word about the pipelines, or even quoted the White House´s denial of his report. It´s been almost a month, how long will the West continue to play dumb?Some say Hersh´s report cites anonymous sources and lacks sufficient evidence, therefore, the US and Western media dare not to follow up. This is untenable and they think too highly of the US and Western media. Compared with Hersh´s detailed investigative report, major US media outlets have published countless unreliable reports without any hesitation or psychological burden. For instance, the Wall Street Journal recently hyped a ""low confidence"" report on virus origins tracing. A more convincing explanation is that they all know the waters here are too deep, so they chose to ""wisely"" avoid it.The performance of the US and Western media once again illustrates that their so-called independence and professionalism are selective. It´s not just the US and Western media, but almost the entire Western world is very passive in seeking the truth behind the Nord Stream bombing. At a recent related UN meeting, the UK showed ""tolerance,"" holding that more investigations are unnecessary and claiming it was unclear why the Russian Federation is suddenly pursuing the issue with such urgency. Many countries including Germany, one of the biggest victims of this incident, has yet to make a public statement.Throughout the Western world, they are even afraid to mention Hersh´s name, not to mention questioning him. This is quite abnormal.The Nord Stream bombing is an extreme international political event. If such a big issue is deliberately covered up by some countries and ends up being in a confusing state with no consequences for those responsible, the harm will be more than damage to the interests of the victims. More and more evidence shows that the Nord Stream sabotage was a deliberate act, and from the perspective of physical conditions, it is difficult to imagine that non-state actors are capable of carrying out such destruction alone. From the perspective of the common interests of the international community, the consequences of the Nord Stream sabotage will be intensified and enlarged, further lowering the bottom line of the way of great power competition. In short, if a country can bomb the Nord Stream pipelines today, it may destroy undersea cables tomorrow, and the security of global infrastructure will be severely threatened, which is terrifying to the whole world.The world is facing such risks. A balloon made Washington to act like a startled bird, while Hersh´s report has been collectively ignored in the Western world. This is chilling. At a public meeting held by the Security Council in September last year, many countries called for an investigation into the incident to uncover the truth and identify those responsible. We believe that conducting an objective, fair and professional investigation is not only necessary but also urgent, which is closely related to the interests and concerns of each country. The international community should make concerted efforts on this issue.In recent years, Washington has frequently threatened to punish others using the excuses of ""threats"" on the international stage. Now, the Nord Stream bombing has exposed the security loopholes facing human society. When it comes to this matter, the US and other Western countries, which have always held an attitude of ""better to kill a thousand innocent people than let one truly guilty person go free"" on security issues, should stop pretending cordiality. It should be noted that even if someone holds the microphone for a moment, they can never monopolize the truth forever.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0302/c90000-10214839.html,2,3,2023,"['nord', 'stream', 'report', 'western', 'hersh', 'countries', 'international', 'security', 'abnormal', 'global', 'public', 'truth', 'bombing', 'issue', 'interests', 'west', 'times', 'big', 'stone', 'investigative']",0.38565972222222217

""This can only have been done for political reasons.""Woolhouse added that another reason for testing was to track new COVID-19 variants, but no one in the UK seemed worried about the new variant XBB.1.5, which now accounts for about 40 percent of cases and is spreading rapidly in the U.S..""Instead, a lot of noise is being made about hypothetical variants emerging in China,"" said Woolhouse.Professor Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia also told the newspaper: ""Point-of-entry and point-of-exit screening for serious infections have been shown -- on many occasions -- to be ineffective at controlling diseases.""""This isn't going to protect the UK population because it isn't going to stop the spread.

BBC an infamous propaganda machine long before India documentary saga - People's Daily Online,"BBC an infamous propaganda machine long before India documentary saga (Global Times) 14:11, February 23, 2023Fake news is like Pinocchio´s nose, the more you lie, the longer it grows. Illustration: Liu Rui/GTBritish MP Jim Shannon has claimed that the raids by Indian tax authorities on the BBC´s Delhi and Mumbai offices are a ""blatant attack on press freedoms,"" according to UK media reports on Tuesday.The accusations came after the BBC´s offices in India were raided as part of a tax investigation by Indian authorities. However, some British politicians deliberately linked it to India´s actions against a BBC documentary known as ""India: The Modi Question"" aired in January.According to Song Luzheng, a research fellow at Fudan University, the BBC made the documentary against the backdrop of the West´s disfavor of Modi´s governing style and the UK´s unease toward the rapid development of India, a former colony of the UK.The BBC, as a typical Western media outlet, claims to be objective and fact-based. Nonetheless, it´s not reporting facts but doing opinion journalism. In essence, it´s a propaganda machine that serves the Western imperialism. The BBC is not a news media outlet in the common sense, but a tool to attack other countries that the West does not see eye to eye with. The BBC knows it is just a propaganda tool, but when it is confronted, it touts press freedom. When British politicians defend the BBC as a national treasure, they ignore the fact that this propaganda machine has long been infamous in other countries.As Chinese netizens put it, the BBC reports China with a ""gloom filter."" That´s why the sky over Chinese cities is always murky, cloudy, misty and polluted in BBC´s video about China.Meanwhile, the West adopts its own set of values and standards -- it only agrees with what fits their standards and bans whatever doesn't fit the standards. In early 2021, the UK regulator ofcom revoked the broadcast license of the Chinese state broadcaster CGTN in the UK because of its coverage of the Hong Kong protests. When the UK suppressed Chinese media outlets using various excuses, why did it turn a blind eye to the fabrication and neglect of justice of its own media?Song from Fudan University told the Global Times that the West will not reflect on their double standards; in other words, there is no such a word as ""double standards"" in their dictionary.""Rather, the West believes it is the rightful one. The hostility, extreme prejudice and neglect of professionalism of Western media reflects their arrogance and supremacist mentality,"" said Song.Song believes that although the West has been wooing India currently for geopolitical reasons, the fact that India´s GDP last year exceeded that of the UK has hurt the dignity of the UK, especially due to the UK´s imperialist mind-set over India.Nie Shujiang, an associate professor at the Guangming School of Journalism and Communication of China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times that the way of reporting by Western media shows their degradation.""The mainstream Western media, represented by the BBC, and the interest groups behind them are losing their long-held cultural taste and standard of values. Against the trend of 'the East is rising and the West is declining,' they resort to smear and deception to fool their own people and the international community,"" said Nie.The international status of a country´s media is determined by the strength of the country and its adherence to media ethics. The BBC has lost the latter, and the UK is losing the former. The days when Western countries ask for economic benefits from developing countries while demanding them to be loyal to Western values are long gone.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0223/c90000-10211967.html,23,2,2023,"['india', 'west', 'western', 'standards', 'propaganda', 'long', 'song', 'countries', 'machine', 'documentary', 'global', 'times', 'university', 'fact', 'eye', 'china', 'values', 'infamous', 'indian', 'tax']",0.28398437499999996

Chinese modernization provides a roadmap for China’s future development: UK expert - People's Daily Online,"Chinese modernization provides a roadmap for China’s future development: UK expertBy Du Mingming, Peng Yukai (People´s Daily Online) 14:45, January 06, 2023 Editor´s note:With the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) concluding in October 22, 2022, China has formally embarked on a new journey of building a modern socialist country with a new blueprint. As the congress attracted worldwide attention, People’s Daily Online interviewed many foreign experts, scholars, as well as those foreign friends residing in China, to learn their thoughts about the congress as well as China’s future development.David Ferguson is currently the honorary chief English editor for the Foreign Language Press in China. Previously a football agent, Ferguson has been working and living in China for 16 years. He is also a recipient of the Chinese Government Friendship Award and the 15th Special Book Award in 2021.Next station, ChinaFerguson first came to China in 2004 on a business trip. Despite being able to speak several languages, the native Scot had no idea about the Far Eastern country.“I thought China was a huge country with one or two small outposts of modernity in places like Shanghai and Beijing, and the rest of the country was one enormous paddy field populated by poor peasants in gray clothes growing rice,” Ferguson recalled.Ferguson decided to settle in China to take advantage of some promising new opportunities in 2006, together with his wife and young son. After trying his hand at several different jobs, he happened to witness the false reports fabricated by Western media on the turmoil in Tibet in March 2008. He felt angry and told himself, “If this is how they're going to behave, somebody has to do a more honest and accurate job.”With that as his motivation, Ferguson joined China.org.cn, a web-based information and news provider, and worked as a journalist and editor doing his best to present a reasonable, accurate and honest picture of China to Western audiences.He has taken part in multiple reports on a series of major news events such as the Wenchuan Earthquake, the Beijing Olympics, and the Shanghai EXPO.Two years later, Ferguson joined Foreign Language Press (FLP). When he accepted the job, he never imagined that he would stay in that post for 12 years, longer than any previous jobs he had worked in. Photo of David Ferguson (Provided by the interviewee)China, a new pathAs a writer and an editor for FLP, one of Ferguson’s main tasks for the past five to six years has been editing political works translated from Chinese. One of the most remarkable works that Ferguson edited is none other than “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China”, which also helped him win the Chinese Government Friendship Award and the 15th Book Award of China in 2021.In Ferguson’s opinion, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is not just an individual idea. Instead, it is comprised of multiple policies and ideas that fit together as a structure, providing a roadmap for China’s development.Ferguson paid a great deal of attention to the 20th CPC National Congress. In his opinion, the congress was held at a “fortunate and timely” period. Facing the fact that the world is undergoing changes of a magnitude unseen in a century, the congress allowed China to figure out some major issues, both domestic and international, that had to be carefully handled. Photo taken on November 27, 2017, shows David Ferguson holding a copy of “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China” at a signing ceremony in Beijing (Photo courtesy of the Foreign Language Press)In a report at the opening session of the Congress, President Xi underscored that the ""central task"" of the CPC “will be to lead the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to realize the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization.""Just as people are curious about what direction China will take in the next five years and more, Ferguson noted that the “central task” showed the unique political strength of the Communist Party of China.“There isn't any other country in the world (other than China) that is actively looking forward 27 years and planning what the country is going to be looking like at that point,” said Ferguson. “It’s an indication of the Chinese system that they can do that. If you look at what is happening in the UK right now, the prime minister has been sacked after a month. What kind of long-term plan can they make?”In terms of Chinese modernization, Ferguson emphasizes that people should make an overall distinction between Chinese modernization and the modernization that the US and other Western countries have undergone. Given China’s different nature from the Western world, it is unreasonable to evaluate Chinese modernization using the critiques of Western modernization.“Chinese modernization is not a path about exploiting the majority for the interest of the minority,” said Ferguson. “It’s a path that involves win-win cooperation with other people. It´s a path that involves people-oriented development, people-centered development. The CPC is doing a good job in leading China along the path, which means that they are making sure that no one is left behind and everyone can share the fruits of development.”Emotional hostility toward ChinaFor a long time, there has been a negative and hostile narrative against China and the Communist Party of China from the Western media. On the surface, it seems that misunderstanding is the reason behind the confrontation between China and the West. However, being a “Westerner” and having lived in China for more than a decade, Ferguson holds a different perspective.“A misunderstanding is a rational thing that happens because of a lack of information or because of misleading information,” said Ferguson. “The problem that China is dealing with, however, is an emotional hostility that has been deliberately created. Fundamentally, it began with the issue that the United States cannot accept the fact that it is not going to be the world’s No. 1.”Ferguson noted that the US has spent a long time believing that its system is the only system that works, and other countries should be more like the US if they want to be successful. Now, they're facing a very large country that is doing very well without adopting the Western system. With their innate sense of their system’s superiority, Western people cannot deal with the fact that their emotional need to feel superior is being challenged. As a result, all the subsequent reactions are emotional.With China embarking on a new journey of building a modern socialist country, Ferguson holds a positive attitude towards the bright but challenging future. “I’m very confident that China will achieve its goals,” said Ferguson. “Even in the worst circumstances, I’m still confident that China will continue to be successful.”Having lived and worked in China for more than a decade, Ferguson is satisfied with his work and life, and believes he has more to offer. “I’d like to do more work presenting China,” said Ferguson. “A lot of people are now active on social media.

London, a leading foreign exchange market, has also actively adopted the internationalization of the renminbi, he added.Stressing the importance of green development, McLean said that ""green is the new driver"" of UK-China financial cooperation. Both countries have been keen players in green finance, such as green bond issuance, he said.McLean, also chair of the UK-China Business Development Center and a senior adviser to the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK, listed several other areas in which businesses in the UK and China could further cooperate. These include education, pharmaceuticals, the arts, green energy and electric vehicles.McLean said that although the people-to-people and government-to-government exchanges between the UK and China were considerably reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, business-to-business ties have continued unabated.According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), UK-China trade in goods increased in 2022.

China urges UK to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs - People's Daily Online,"China urges UK to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs (Xinhua) 10:01, January 14, 2023BEIJING, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- China urges the UK to respect China´s sovereignty and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Friday.Wang´s comment came after the UK government issued a six-monthly report on Hong Kong which contains criticism on Hong Kong affairs.""We stress again that the UK has been ignoring the fact that Hong Kong has long returned to its motherland. It keeps publishing the so-called six-monthly reports on Hong Kong. This grossly interferes in Hong Kong affairs, which are China´s internal affairs, and seriously violates international law and basic norms governing international relations. China firmly rejects it,"" Wang said at a regular news briefing.Since Hong Kong´s return, the Chinese government has fully, faithfully, and resolutely implemented the policy of one country, two systems, under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. Hong Kong residents enjoy far more rights and freedoms in accordance with the law than they did before 1997, Wang said.""Anyone unbiased would agree that the national security law and the improved electoral system for Hong Kong has enabled it to enter a new stage in which Hong Kong has restored order and is set to thrive,"" he said.This has effectively protected national security and social stability in the region. International investors share the view that Hong Kong´s business environment has become safer, more stable and more predictable, Wang said.""The UK has no sovereignty, no jurisdiction and no right of supervision over Hong Kong after its return to China,"" Wang said, adding that the legal basis for the Chinese government´s governance of Hong Kong is China´s Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), not the Sino-British Joint Declaration.Despite Hong Kong people´s shared desire for a safe and stable Hong Kong, the UK continues to smear the central government´s governance of Hong Kong, denigrate the SAR government´s lawful administration, undermine the rule of law in the SAR and openly endorse illegal anti-China elements who attempt to create chaos in Hong Kong such as Jimmy Lai, all in the name of democracy, freedom, human rights and rule of law, he said.""Such hypocrisy will lead nowhere.

"Interview: Some UK households face ""heat or eat"" dilemma, says scholar - People's Daily Online","Interview: Some UK households face ""heat or eat"" dilemma, says scholar (Xinhua) 13:26, December 22, 2022LONDON, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- Facing the combined effects of sub-zero temperatures and increasing prices, some families across the United Kingdom (UK) have to juggle their incomes between staying warm or buying food, a Glasgow Caledonian University research fellow told Xinhua. Simply put, their choice is between heat or eat.Many in the country had already been in a rather tight financial position before the cold weather set in, Dr. Keith Baker said.Last week was a particularly cold one across the UK, with snow, ice and fog warnings in several places. Dec. 12 was the coldest day in the UK since December 2010, the Met Office said.As a scholar, Baker has worked with groups seeking to help people faced with the dual problem of a cost-of-living crisis and high energy bills. ""People really are on the line between just and only just about surviving and being pushed into really quite deplorable situations.""Inflation has been running high in the UK since last winter, reaching successive new records. In November, the UK´s consumer price index (CPI) rose by 10.7 percent. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increased by 16.5 percent in that month.""We don't know how high some food prices are going to rise. Barely a day goes by before you see that the price of one type of food is going up, next day the price of another type of food is going up,"" Baker said, adding that this level of uncertainty is detrimental to mental health.Inflation is being driven mainly by soaring energy prices. In October, UK households paid 88.9 percent more on average for electricity, gas and other fuels than a year ago, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Domestic gas prices in October were more than double that a year earlier.People have suffered substantially with their bills going up, Baker said. ""Energy bills will go up to about 2,600 British pounds (3,146 U.S. dollars) on average, and I stress that´s average, rising again to 3,000 pounds as of April.""""We've now got to the point where charities are trying to get out warm clothing to people.""Public libraries and community centers across the UK have thrown open their doors to people eager to escape the cold in their homes, offering warm drinks and hot soup.Acknowledging that the government support offered by newly installed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt may go some way to help families on welfare benefits, Baker has called for more.""A lot of households are already in the position of no heat and less to eat, and I really wish politicians would get it through their heads that some householders are really in a dire situation.""

Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks (Xinhua) 12:21, March 11, 2023VIENNA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called for advancing open, transparent, inclusive and sustainable intergovernmental discussion at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address the proliferation risks posed by the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation.Li Song, China´s permanent representative to the IAEA, said at a meeting of the agency´s Board of Governors that the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration poses serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation regime, stimulates arms race, and threatens the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.In September 2021, the United States, Britain and Australia announced the AUKUS deal, under which Washington and London will assist Canberra in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. China and many other countries have repeatedly expressed concerns over the transfer of high purity uranium involved in the pact.The essence of the AUKUS cooperation is the transfer of tons of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from the United States and Britain, both nuclear-weapon states and signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to Australia, a non-nuclear-weapon state, Li said.He added such a ""textbook case"" of nuclear proliferation violates NPT´s objectives and principles, and undermines the IAEA´s existing safeguard system and the international non-proliferation regime.He urged the AUKUS countries to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset, fulfill their international obligations and contribute more to regional peace and stability.It is up to all IAEA member states to seek proper solutions through intergovernmental discussions regarding whether and how to conduct safeguards on the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration, as the matter concerns the interests of all the member states and the integrity and effectiveness of the NPT, he said.Stressing that China respects the right of all other member states to express their views, Li said that China firmly opposes any country trying to impose its own views on others.""The U.S., the UK and Australia, while preaching the so-called 'highest non-proliferation standards,' are labeling normal intergovernmental discussions as 'politicized' and rejecting multilateral discussions. Is this what they call the 'rules-based international order?'"" he said.Noting it is essential to keep the intergovernmental discussion going at the IAEA as the AUKUS countries are about to announce concrete plans for their nuclear submarine cooperation, Li said that only true multilateralism can effectively safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation regime.Li called on the IAEA member states to actively participate in the intergovernmental discussion process to help safeguard the global non-proliferation regime.He said he believes IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and the agency´s secretariat will play their due roles in the process and assist the member states in maintaining and advancing the process.He also urged the AUKUS countries not to settle on relevant safeguards arrangements with the IAEA secretariat or start nuclear submarine cooperation before a consensus is reached among the agency´s member states.The AUKUS countries should respond to the international community´s concerns with concrete actions, fulfill their non-proliferation obligations, and maintain candid and transparent communication with other member states on the basis of equality and mutual respect, he added.Representatives from Russia and other developing countries spoke in support of China´s position on the AUKUS issue at the IAEA board meeting. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220521.html,11,3,2023,"['aukus', 'proliferation', 'nuclear', 'states', 'iaea', 'international', 'member', 'countries', 'intergovernmental', 'submarine', 'li', 'china', 'discussion', 'agency', 'cooperation', 'regime', 'risks', 'called', 'australia', 'concerns']",0.4014713064713065
Natural disaster sends strong call for human solidarity - People's Daily Online,"Natural disaster sends strong call for human solidarityBy Global Times editorial (Global Times) 08:39, February 08, 2023The powerful earthquakes that occurred in southern Turkey on Monday caused severe casualties in Turkey and Syria. In the face of serious natural disasters, human society has revealed its fragile and resilient sides. After the earthquake, many countries and regions around the world, including China, have expressed their condolences and provided help to Turkey and Syria. It is worth mentioning that Sweden, which recently has had tense relations with Turkey, and Israel, an ""old enemy"" of Syria, have temporarily put aside their political differences and actively participated in disaster relief efforts. This has created a moving scene where the two countries in need have gained global support.Turkey and Syria, particularly the latter, have long been spots of conflict in international geopolitics. Syria has already experienced the chronic pain of years of turmoil and war, and strong earthquakes are really intensifying the pain. The international community should strive to reach the common goal of providing timely help to the victims and preventing a more serious humanitarian disaster from happening due to the earthquake. Thus, the international community, especially the major powers, needs to achieve unity and coordination at a larger level.Huge disasters are often characterized by shocking scenes that create a strong sense of shared destiny in a short period of time, as well as the expectation and call for human solidarity. This kind of understanding, which has been gained at a tragic cost, is invaluable and should be widely and firmly practiced in human society. However, there is a huge gap between reality and the ideal, which is widening because of some forces. Recently, humanity has faced common challenges, one after another, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to regional conflicts to climate change. However, it has not facilitated the formation of the true solidarity necessary to deal with global issues. The dysfunction of relations between major powers, the disorder of the international order, and the imbalance of global governance are the more profound crisis of human society at present, wasting the disasters and sufferings that humanity has endured time and again.Many people have the same feeling that since entering the third decade of the 21st century, international relations seem to have fallen into the quagmire of accelerated regression. Whether it is populism and trade protectionism in the economic field, or zero-sum game and geopolitical conflicts in the international political field, they are all escalating and an inertia that is continuously deteriorating has even been formed. Against this background, it is even more valuable for countries around the world to jointly support Turkey and Syria to resist disasters; but this kind of unity should not only be short-lived in the face of a sudden global crisis. We hope it can continue to warm the world.Needless to say, there isn't much optimism on how long the current unity or harmony can last. Just a few days before the earthquake, some Western countries including the US, the UK, Germany and France temporarily closed their consulates in Istanbul or issued security warnings about Turkey citing ""security concerns,"" triggering fierce protests in Turkey, which can be called a ""diplomatic earthquake."" The matter has not been resolved. It is conceivable that in the land where the earthquake occurred, disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction may still encounter obstacles and resistance at the geopolitical level.And we still need to mention Syria, a country that has been suffering from war for more than a decade, which has caused more damage than an earthquake. However, it is regrettable that the US still cannot let go of its geopolitical obsession at this moment, and has ruled out any possibility of contacting the Syrian government. But as we all know, the Syrian government is the main executor of the post-earthquake rescue operations. Meanwhile, Washington has also ignored calls to lift sanctions on Syria ""immediately"" so that aid can be provided.The Chinese sci-fi movie The Wandering Earth 2, which is currently being screened, shows that true unity and cooperation can be achieved when the entire human race is at a critical juncture of life and death and will be destroyed if humanity doesn't unite. We hope that in the real world we will not wait until the last minute to be forced to make a choice, but will be one step ahead, and take the initiative as soon as possible.Every time after a disaster, people sympathize with the victims from the bottom of their hearts, and sincerely hope to provide help as much as they can. It is a shining part of universal humanity. It allows us to see the deep strength of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and be confident that the world will eventually become a better and warmer place.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0208/c90000-10204655.html,8,2,2023,"['turkey', 'syria', 'earthquake', 'disaster', 'human', 'global', 'international', 'disasters', 'countries', 'unity', 'humanity', 'strong', 'society', 'relations', 'community', 'geopolitical', 'hope', 'natural', 'call', 'times']",0.36766666666666664

British business community eyes stronger trade ties with China - People's Daily Online,"British business community eyes stronger trade ties with China (Xinhua) 08:59, February 10, 2023LONDON, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- British business leaders have said they hope that trade ties between Britain and China will deepen as the two countries work toward economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic.The remarks were made Wednesday during the ""Icebreakers"" 2023 Chinese New Year celebration, jointly hosted by the 48 Group Club, China Chamber of Commerce in the UK and China-Britain Business Council.In 1954, Jack Perry, founder of the London Export Corporation, led a group of 48 British businessmen on a historic trade mission to Beijing. This helped create one of the first modern-day trade links with China, effectively breaking the U.S.-led Western embargo on the newly-founded People´s Republic of China.The 48 men were the founders of the 48 Group Club. Their trip to Beijing became known as the ""Icebreaking Mission,"" while the club members were called ""Icebreakers.""Chinese Ambassador to Britain Zheng Zeguang said in his keynote speech that a blueprint for China´s development over the next five years, and in the longer-term, was drawn up at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year.""This will open up broad space for cooperation between China and other countries, the UK included,"" he said.Lord Hammond of Runnymede, former chancellor of the Exchequer, underlined that China is the world´s second-largest economy, the UK´s sixth-largest export market, and fourth-largest trade partner overall.""Many of our global partners have been quietly increasing their share of trade with China, while we've seen ours stagnate over the pandemic period.

Massive strikes to hit Britain during Christmas season - People's Daily Online,"Massive strikes to hit Britain during Christmas season (Xinhua) 10:13, December 17, 2022LONDON, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) faces weeks of massive strikes during the Christmas season by transport and postal workers, nurses, and border guards.A wave of industrial action began on Tuesday, with more than 40,000 members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) walking out for 48 hours. Three more weeks of disruption are set to follow.Britain´s National Railway said due to various industrial actions, there will be a reduced train service until Jan. 8, 2023, with ""significant disruption expected across the rail network.""The Communication Workers Union (CWU) also said there would be strikes on Dec. 23 and Dec. 24, some of the busiest days for pre-Christmas deliveries.Meanwhile, the Public and Commercial Service (PCS) union has announced that Civil Service industrial action in late December will impact Border Force services. Travelers who are planning to enter the UK during the proposed strike period may face longer waiting times at border controls.Nurses have also joined the list of striking workers.""Up to 100,000 nursing staff are taking part in strikes in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, and a further day of strike action is planned for Dec. 20,"" said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).Gemma Dean, a human resources expert and lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University´s business school told Xinhua in an interview: ""The industrial situation we're seeing at the moment, with a significant increase in strikes, has been something we haven't seen in the UK for a little while.""What we're seeing right now are groups of workers going on strike or taking forms of industrial action that typically haven't done so. For example, ambulance drivers and nurses. Some of these groups have never gone on strike, so it is surprising to see that, but it may be reflective of the depth of feeling that employees have now about their pay and their terms and conditions of employment,"" said Dean.The current high inflation rate in the UK and cost-of-living increases have put a lot of pressure on people, said Madeleine Stevens, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University.""After working through the pandemic the morale was an all-time high at one point, and then it was an all-time low,"" a nurse told Xinhua.""And now is the time to give the nurses what they and the rest of Britain´s National Health Service (NHS) deserve. After everything they've done, they work back-to-back shifts, no days off, for very little pay,"" the nurse said.Stevens told Xinhua: ""I think the wave of industrial action we see now is not only a roller coaster effect from the rail strikes and the Royal Mail, and then it´s kind of growing in momentum, but also with Christmas time coming people are feeling pressure and worries. It´s driven by fear, which is very unpleasant.""There could even be further consequences than the strikes, Stevens said. ""It could be more than just the public service sector that´s struggling with pay awards and the cost of living. It impacts every single one of us. So there is a risk, if the demand for pay goes up, that it will have further implications for the wider community,"" she said.""And perhaps a strategy to consider is to rather look at some of the causes that will benefit across the board, the nation across the board,"" Stevens suggested.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1217/c90000-10185233.html,17,12,2022,"['strikes', 'industrial', 'workers', 'action', 'service', 'christmas', 'nurses', 'strike', 'pay', 'stevens', 'britain', 'border', 'national', 'union', 'rail', 'massive', 'season', 'december', 'weeks', 'transport']",0.4848198198198198
UK's ethnic minorities more likely to die from COVID-19: The Guardian - People's Daily Online,"UK´s ethnic minorities more likely to die from COVID-19: The Guardian (Xinhua) 08:55, March 03, 2023LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- In a recent opinion piece carried by The Guardian, Safiah Ngah lamented the fact that people from ethnic minorities were more likely to die from COVID-19 but Britain has been slow in dealing with structural racism.To illustrate her point, she cited the death of her father, a Malaysian national who came to Britain in the 1970s and later settled here. He worked for the National Health Service (NHS) for nearly 40 years.Citing new data from the Office for National Statistics, Ngah said her dad, a non-white person, was significantly more likely to die from COVID-19.""His death and the deaths of so many others from 'minority' ethnic groups were the result of consistent and incontrovertible failures within government, and apathy towards the communities most affected by the virus. This apathy has unfortunately extended into the way the inquiry itself has been conducted,"" she said.When the COVID inquiry began last year, she felt cautiously optimistic about its potential to allow families like hers, who have been bereaved by COVID, to understand the context within which their loved ones died.""Sadly, the inquiry is refusing to look at the issue of structural racism, or listen to those who were bereaved. Families like mine are being let down all over again,"" she said.The inquiry is terrified of touching the issue of race: it wouldn't even use the word in its terms of reference, she said, adding that the inquiry announced this month that structural racism would not be examined in its first module on pandemic preparation, as it would be an ""impossible task.""""Structural racism is a challenging issue. It is also an issue that lies at the heart of the UK´s high death rate, thus it is absolutely necessary to a thorough and fair inquiry into the pandemic.

In July, the United Kingdom (UK) recorded its highest ever temperature. Hungary this year also endured its hottest summer since 1901.Amid the scorching heatwaves, natural disasters ensued. A wildfire caused by a lightning strike in June became the worst ever recorded in Spain. Several parts of Italy also saw wildfires, including a massive one that burned over 850 hectares of land and forced more than 1,000 residents to evacuate.In late August, Europe was experiencing its worst drought in at least 500 years, with almost two-thirds of the continent in a state of alert or warning. Water levels of the river Drava in eastern Croatia dropped to a historic low.Photo taken on Aug. 31, 2022 shows a drought-affected farm field in Staffordshire, Britain. (Photo by Jon Super/Xinhua)Floods have posed another threat. A storm hit the northern Adriatic port of Rijeka in Croatia in September, with the downpour flooding the city center and damaging buildings. Intense rains early this month in Portugal also led to disturbances to road traffic and flooding at Lisbon Airport.With the higher frequency of extreme weather events came increasing concerns over climate change. Temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average over the past 30 years, the highest of any continent in the world, a report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) showed in early November.As a result, Alpine glaciers lost 30 meters in ice thickness from 1997 to 2021, and the Greenland ice sheet is melting and contributing to accelerating sea level rise, the report said.""Europe presents a live picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from impacts of extreme weather events,"" WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said.A car moves in flood water after heavy rain in Brod na Kupi, Croatia, Sept. 29, 2022.

Germany, Austria, Poland, the Netherlands and Greece were among the first to reopen coal power plants or take measures to support coal power.Europe´s thermal coal imports through November jumped by 36.2 percent from the same period in 2021 to roughly 83 million tonnes, a Reuters columnist quoted ship-tracking data from Kpler as saying in a December article.This summer, the European Parliament also voted in favor of plans to award a green investment label to nuclear and gas projects, sparking claims of ""greenwashing"" by some EU member states and environmental lobbyists.Photo taken on Sept. 10, 2022 shows a household gas stove in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

It is a demonstration of double standards,"" Kenya-based international relations scholar Cavince Adhere said.In early December, the UK government also approved the country´s first new coal mine in three decades, largely for steelmaking. Despite an official endorsement that the mine seeks to be net zero in its operations and contribute to local employment, criticism mounted over its lasting environmental impact.The coal mine will release some 250 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next 30 years, according to Myles Allen, professor of geosystem sciences at the University of Oxford.A train passes a thermal power plant in Berlin, Germany, Sept. 8, 2022. (Xinhua/Ren Pengfei)Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate change economics and policy at the University of Oxford, emphasized the difference between a short-term increase in fossil fuel use in response to the energy crisis, and new long-term investment in a coal mine.The decision to approve the mine sends a completely wrong message about the UK´s commitment to net zero, Fankhauser said. ""It looks hypocritical in the eyes of low-income countries, whose own fossil fuel ambitions we have repeatedly criticized.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1226/c90000-10188211.html,26,12,2022,"['europe', 'extreme', 'climate', 'events', 'coal', 'weather', 'change', 'summer', 'heat', 'heatwaves', 'mine', 'december', 'highest', 'years', 'energy', 'high', 'lost', 'natural', 'disasters', 'floods']",0.4517945233061511

I did not understand their language, but I could feel their strong interest in our traditional Chinese culture through their excited faces,"" said Li, who has been playing Cuju for 18 years and has showcased his skills overseas many times in recent years.Cuju can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) and Warring States Period (475-221BC).

Whole world pays price for US sanctions: China Daily editorial - People's Daily Online,"Whole world pays price for US sanctions: China Daily editorial (Chinadaily.com.cn) 15:12, February 24, 2023While US President Joe Biden reiterated the need for additional sanctions on Russia in a speech in Poland on Tuesday, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo was a little more specific in a speech he delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington on the same day.Attributing the reports that Russia has had to turn to the Democratic People´s Republic of Korea and Iran to resupply its military with drones and surface-to-surface missiles to the effectiveness of the US-led sanctions, Adeyemo said that the United States plans to announce additional sanctions this week targeting Russia´s military manufacturing industry.""While we have far more to do, we are succeeding in reversing the course of Russia´s budget and undercutting its military-industrial complex,"" said Adeyemo, pledging that the additional sanctions will focus on cracking down on sanctions evasion and putting economic pressure on countries and corporations that continue to do business with Russia.Over 30 countries have imposed price caps on Russian energy exports, instituted export controls, frozen Russian funds and restricted its access to SWIFT, a global financial transaction system.However, the sanctions are being imposed without the United Nations' authorization and have no legitimacy in international laws. The great lengths the US is going to in its efforts to claim the moral high ground by portraying the sanctions as actions for democracy indicate how desperate it is to cover up the nature of the sanctions, which are simply geopolitical weapons wielded by Washington in a bid to bleed Russia´s economy in world trade and Russian military on the battlefields in Ukraine.Although those following the US' lead in imposing sanctions represent more than half the world´s economy combined, they only account for about one-sixth of the number of countries and regions in the world and they are mostly developed economies. In weaponizing trade, technology and finance with the sanctions, the US has formed a gang at the top of the global supply, industry and value chains so that it can impose its will on the rest of the world through long-arm jurisdiction and replace the rules of the international order in various sectors with US rules.Yet Russia´s economy is performing better than expected. This year, its economy is projected to outperform the UK´s, growing 0.3 percent, while the UK faces a 0.6 percent contraction, according to the International Monetary Fund. It is clear that the sanctions bite both ways if not more on those that impose them — an energy shortage has forced some leading European economies, including Germany, to remap the upgrading path of their industries.The IMF reported last month that Russia´s economy would contract by just 2.2 percent in 2022, far less than the 8.5 percent envisaged by the West in March 2022 when it started imposing large-scale sanctions on the country. The report also projects that business activity in Russia will grow by 0.3 percent in 2023 and 2.1 percent in 2024, directly outpacing the 1.6 percent projected for the eurozone.Now is the time for the world to ask for how long will it continue to tolerate, if not pay for, the US continuing to manipulate the international rules through illegal sanctions under a noble disguise for its own hegemony.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0224/c90000-10212624.html,24,2,2023,"['sanctions', 'russia', 'economy', 'military', 'international', 'additional', 'adeyemo', 'countries', 'rules', 'price', 'speech', 'washington', 'surface', 'united', 'industry', 'continue', 'business', 'imposed', 'energy', 'global']",0.3283208839091192

We adopted the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,"" he announced.The new framework is a commitment by 196 parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to conserve at least 30 percent of the Earth´s land and ocean area by the next decade. It also will increase the expected annual financial assistance from developed countries through 2030 to help developing nations with biodiversity protection.Furthermore, it promises to reduce government subsidies that are harmful to nature by at least $500 billion per year, addresses the rights of indigenous people, and calls for gender equity in the implementation of the framework.Agreement on adopting the milestone Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework came after four years of discussions and two weeks of intense negotiations. It is the first global framework on biodiversity since the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were adopted 12 years ago.In an exclusive interview with China Daily after the agreement´s adoption, Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said he was ""very happy"" with the outcome.""It´s a historic day for the world. Some people have compared it to the 'Paris Moment', when the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, and I agree it is. It is a historic moment for nature protection around the world. I congratulate the Chinese presidency (of COP15) ... They did fantastic work, we worked very closely together, and it was a great partnership,"" he said.COP15 convened delegates from around the world in Montreal from Dec 7 to Monday to decide on the terms of the post-2020 biodiversity framework.The plenary session to adopt the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was originally scheduled to begin at 7:30 pm local time on Sunday, with the intention of sealing a deal early. However, the session was delayed as negotiations among top officials continued behind closed doors while delegates waited anxiously.At around 2:45 am on Monday, the last official day of the summit, Huang entered the room to announce the start of the plenary meeting. At 3:30 am, when he said that the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework had been adopted, loud applause and cheers greeted the announcement.While waiting for the outcome, Hugo Maria Schally, an adviser on international negotiations from the European Union, said that the ""Chinese presidency is working hard behind the scenes to get us a deal"".Rosalind Helfand, a researcher from the University of Cambridge´s Conservation Leadership Alumni Network who attended the conference on behalf of UN Women, said she hoped to see a global biodiversity framework that helps communicate the importance of a global agreement to save nature.""And that´s why I think that Section K of the framework, which is all about communication, and outreach and awareness and uptake, I think that that´s actually a really important section. And I think there´s some ambitious planning for that. And I really hope to see that happen,"" said Helfand.Section K calls for ""enhanced communication, education and awareness on biodiversity"" by all actors to ensure the effective implementation of the agreement.As COP15 president, China submitted a draft text of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework on Sunday morning that listed 23 targets for achievement by 2030.The new framework includes consensus on several issues that were considered a sticking point throughout the negotiations, including resource commitments from developed countries. Estimates suggested that a $700 billion annual funding gap needed to be closed in the next decade for the biodiversity framework to be effectively implemented.As part of the new deal, parties will collectively mobilize at least $200 billion per year by 2030. The money will come from public and private sources.Specifically, countries from the Global North agreed to scale up conservation funding for developing nations, small-island states and ""countries with economies in transition"" to at least $20 billion per year by 2025, and to $30 billion per year by 2030.During the first part of COP15 in Kunming in October last year, President Xi Jinping set the tone by investing 1.5 billion yuan ($215 million) to establish the Kunming Biodiversity Fund to support biodiversity protection in developing countries. He invited other nations to contribute.Countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Japan, Norway, Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands, along with the European Union, have pledged to increase their financial support to developing nations.So far, the total amount of international biodiversity commitments publicly announced by governments, philanthropists, corporations and investors stands at $8.3 billion annually, according to a tracker by several environmental organizations, including Campaign for Nature and Conservation International.The framework creates a new biodiversity fund within the UN´s existing Global Environment Facility. This came about as a compromise between developing nations, which wanted a new fund, and developed countries, which did not.The deal also recognizes the roles and contributions of indigenous people.In a statement, The International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity thanked the COP15 president for including ""strong language on respect for the rights of indigenous people and local communities"".All UN member states except the US have ratified the international treaty on biodiversity.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1220/c90000-10185982.html,20,12,2022,"['biodiversity', 'framework', 'global', 'cop', 'montreal', 'countries', 'billion', 'nations', 'kunming', 'deal', 'parties', 'developing', 'agreement', 'international', 'historic', 'china', 'president', 'adopted', 'nature', 'indigenous']",0.30482355197545064
"CH.1.1 strain not expected to spread widely, experts say - People's Daily Online","CH.1.1 strain not expected to spread widely, experts sayBy Wang Xiaoyu (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:36, February 02, 2023People walk on Leijie street, a commercial area famous for its night economy, in Hefei, east China´s Anhui Province, Jan. 6, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhou Mu)China had detected 24 imported cases of the new Omicron variant CH.1.1 and its offshoots as of Monday. However, the strain is not expected to spark widespread transmission in the short term, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.No domestic cases of the strain have been reported so far, China CDC said in a statement released on Tuesday.CH.1.1 is a descendant of BA.2.75, an Omicron subvariant that was first reported in India in July. It is now responsible for about 25 percent of infections in the United Kingdom and has also spread quickly in Denmark and Singapore.The variant features multiple mutations that enhance its ability to evade immunity, including a mutation seen in the more deadly Delta variant. However, there is no evidence pointing to stronger pathogenicity.The majority of people in China have high levels of neutralizing antibodies that can protect them against CH.1.1, China CDC said.""In the short term, CH.1.1 will not trigger large-scale outbreaks,"" it said, adding that people age 65 and older, those with preexisting illnesses and unvaccinated people should maintain personal protection.China is nearing the end of the current outbreak, with BF.7 and BA.5.2 remaining the dominant strains, health officials said recently.Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at China CDC, said the nation has established basic herd immunity against COVID-19.In an interview with People´s Daily on Wednesday, he said 80 to 90 percent of people in China have acquired immunity from recent infections. That figure, coupled with vaccination coverage hitting 90 percent, means that herd immunity has been established in a basic form.""In the short term, the epidemic situation is safe, and the thunderstorms have passed,"" he said.In the long run, many uncertainties remain, such as the threat from emerging imported strains and the risk facing unvaccinated elderly people, Zeng said.By Jan 20, the Chinese mainland had administered nearly 3.5 billion doses of vaccines and fully vaccinated 90.5 percent of its total population, official data shows.Wang Quanyi, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said on Tuesday that the Chinese capital has built temporary herd immunity and the risk of another COVID wave in the next three months is small.He suggested that unvaccinated people age 80 and above seize the window of opportunity and get inoculated.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0202/c90000-10202240.html,2,2,2023,"['china', 'ch', 'immunity', 'strain', 'variant', 'short', 'term', 'cdc', 'unvaccinated', 'herd', 'expected', 'spread', 'wang', 'jan', 'imported', 'cases', 'omicron', 'center', 'disease', 'control']",0.31695415695415696
Conditions ripe for international students to return to China - People's Daily Online,"Conditions ripe for international students to return to ChinaBy Zou Shuo  (China Daily) 13:57, February 21, 2023After a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, numbers are set to quickly rise to reach levels seen before the outbreak. China´s rich culture, history, innovation and rapid growth and development in economic and technological terms will continue to attract international students, according to those already studying in the country.The cuisine, rich scenery and friendliness of the Chinese people have all left good impressions on the students, who are happy to promote friendship and closeness between citizens of their home countries and Chinese people.They said China´s optimization of its COVID-19 epidemic control measures means more international students will come to the country to study.A lack of understanding, knowledge and awareness often creates the biggest misunderstandings, bias or even conflict, and having international students from different countries in China is an opportunity to show the country to those at home from a genuine perspective and establish a stronger bridge between different cultures, they added.Unofficial 'ambassadors'The students are a link between China and their own countries, bringing different perspectives and acting as ""ambassadors"" for China at home, they said.Hasan Mahady is a second-year undergraduate at Beijing Jiaotong University. The 23-year-old from Bangladesh said China is one of the safest countries in the world, noting that Beijing is one of the largest and busiest places in China, yet there is almost no crime in the city.The cost of studying in China is relatively low, compared with places such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and European countries. Given the guarantee of quality education, international students who decide to study in China are less burdened financially, he said.As the government invests to provide resources for universities and internationalize the education system, the country´s universities are increasingly well-respected globally, while more schools in China are listed in the Times Higher Education´s World University Rankings than ever before.""Chinese is not the most straightforward language, but it is not impossible to learn. It is one of the most widely spoken languages on Earth, and it looks good on resumes and job applications. China has a lot of opportunities if we speak good Chinese,"" Mahady said.Minh David Thao Chan is a second-year PhD candidate at Tsinghua University, focusing on information technology and telecommunications.The 30-year-old from France said he thinks China has become a leader in technology and will attract intellectuals from across the globe, just as the United States did 30 years ago.China offers many learning opportunities and methodologies, and has great economic development potential, he said.The main reasons he came to China are the culture and language, a willingness to challenge himself, and the improved financial opportunities after graduation, he said.Mexican national Jorge Filio, 25, is studying for a master´s in Chinese Studies at Peking University´s Yenching Academy.He said that the optimization of the epidemic restrictions means China will definitely regain its position as an academic beacon for the best students from the developing world across many disciplines.Filio came to China for the first time in 2017 for a summer program at Tsinghua University´s School of Environment. It took less than a month for him to learn that China is the best environment to grow academically and professionally, he said.""Therefore, I made up my mind to pursue postgraduate studies in Beijing. China is the most different environment that I can think of, and so it is the perfect way to challenge myself,"" he said.Mexico is repositioning itself as a manufacturing hub in North America, encouraging near-shoring and the relocation of transnational companies. The move offers an opportunity to reassess Mexico´s relationship with China and look for industries in which Chinese companies have a technological advantage, then push for their introduction to the Mexican market, he added.Rapid developmentPhearum Vannaseka is an undergraduate at Beijing Jiaotong University, majoring in financial management. The 21-year-old Cambodian native believes that more students from her country will come to China to study as the country optimizes its epidemic control measures.China has rapidly developed its economy, technology and education system, she said. ""As an international student studying in China, I have firsthand knowledge of the fact that Chinese universities don't just teach theories and principles; they also conduct experiments. As a result, the students quickly understand the lessons and their enthusiasm in class increases,"" she said.She added that she came to China to study because it is a highly diverse and historic country.""There are many things to discover and do in China, but the main attraction, in my opinion, is tied to the amazing architecture, delectable cuisine, martial arts and lengthy history of creation,"" she said. She added that Chinese people are genuinely helpful and courteous, and she was pleasantly surprised by how polite they are.""They are really kind to foreigners like me, young and old alike. For instance, I frequently got lost on the street early on, but every time I asked, the local people responded in kind voices and with friendly smiles. I had a homey feeling overall,"" she said.Isidore Chitosi, 23, from Malawi, is a postgraduate student in civil engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University. He decided to study the subject in China because in recent years, the country has made headlines across the globe for its ""skyscraper boom"", and the related buildings are famous for going beyond the boundaries of traditional engineering.In addition, bilateral agreements between China and Malawi have involved China playing a huge role in the construction of some of his country´s key infrastructure, such as the new parliament building in Lilongwe, the capital, and the Malawi University of Science and Technology, he said.""The thing I find most impressive about Chinese people is their admirable work ethic — they always take an earnest approach to completing tasks,"" he said.He added that international students can act as a bridge between the two countries. By gaining an understanding of both cultures, they can help identify the mutual interests and common goals that exist between countries.Chen Shin Ni, 22, is a Malaysian student majoring in pharmaceutical sciences at Tsinghua University.She thinks that many international students will study in China because the education system is good, the living environment is safe and the cost of living is acceptable.International students can help strengthen the relationship between their home country and China by becoming ""ambassadors"" for their countries and sharing their culture and experiences with students from other countries, especially with those from China, she said.Motogo Mangue Mariano Mba, 25, from Equatorial Guinea, is a senior in optoelectronic information science and engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University.""Every time I am asked why I have come to China, my answer is 'Why not?' In recent years, I have grown, matured and fallen in love with the culture, the people and, most importantly, the convenience and safety of China,"" he said.He thinks more students will come to China because no other country in human history has done what China is doing in terms of development and helping the whole world develop.Language of choiceIn addition, he thinks that Mandarin is becoming a language everyone should learn, just like China is a country everyone should visit.""What has impressed me most is the kindness of the people and their ability to make you feel welcome,"" he said.""Chinese people are clear, practical and realistic. They respect all cultures and they understand how important mutual respect is between people from different backgrounds.""As China has some of the world´s largest information and communications technology markets, the country can provide him with the opportunity to build a lucrative career and the skills to develop further within this critical and growing area, he said.""With all that being said, I know people will come to China because it is the future — there is no better place to be right now if you want to make history.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0221/c90000-10210713.html,21,2,2023,"['china', 'students', 'country', 'university', 'international', 'countries', 'study', 'beijing', 'added', 'education', 'technology', 'culture', 'history', 'studying', 'good', 'home', 'jiaotong', 'language', 'thinks', 'environment']",0.41134568274103156
UK gov't introduces laws to mitigate disruption of strikes on public - People's Daily Online,"UK gov't introduces laws to mitigate disruption of strikes on public (Xinhua) 10:28, January 11, 2023LONDON, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) government on Tuesday introduced new laws that would enable it to set minimum levels of service during strikes to ensure the safety of the public and their access to public services.In a bid to mitigate the disruptions caused by strikes, the bill would ensure that crucial public services, such as rail, ambulances and fire services, maintain a minimum service during industrial action, ""reducing risk to life and ensuring the public can still get to work,"" a government statement said.""The first job of any government is to keep the public safe. Because whilst we absolutely believe in the ability to strike, we are duty-bound to protect the lives and livelihoods of the British people,"" Business Secretary Grant Shapps said in the statement.The UK has been in the grip of a wave of strikes, which started in summer 2022 and continued into this year, as inflation has stayed consistently high and pay rises failed to keep up. Rail workers and nurses were among those who staged the action.The government locked horns with the trade unions. It said the pay rises that unions had called for were unaffordable and higher pay would not help fight inflation. On Monday, government ministers and unions met, but the talks once again failed to change course.The unions criticized the new legislation on Tuesday. This bill was ""another dangerous gimmick"" from a government that should be negotiating to resolve the current crisis, said General Secretary Sharon Graham of Unite, one of the largest trade unions in the UK.""Evidence from abroad clearly shows this kind of legislation only forces unions to use other tactics, inflaming and prolonging disputes,"" Graham added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0111/c90000-10194443.html,11,1,2023,"['public', 'government', 'unions', 'strikes', 'services', 'pay', 'laws', 'mitigate', 'tuesday', 'minimum', 'service', 'ensure', 'bill', 'rail', 'action', 'statement', 'secretary', 'inflation', 'rises', 'failed']",0.4131060606060606

Türkiye celebrated the 99th anniversary of the foundation of its republic on Saturday. (Xinhua/Shadati)ANKARA, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- In 2022, Türkiye launched a diplomatic offensive with a number of initiatives to mend fences with regional rivals and actively mediate the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Analysts said that Türkiye, which has complicated or tense relations with many regional heavyweights, played a big role in the shifting of geopolitics in the Middle East in the past year.As Türkiye´s economy struggled with shrinking trade and investment as well as skyrocketing inflation in 2022, the country increased its regional influence with its diplomatic initiatives to normalize ties with Gulf countries, Israel and Egypt.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R) welcomes Saudi Arabia´s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud in Ankara, Turkey, on June 22, 2022.

The two countries signed a dozen of agreements on cooperation in trade, agriculture, technology, defense and other sectors. Analysts said that the shared concerns over Iran were behind the reconciliation between the two countries which had feuded over many regional issues.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R) and Israeli President Isaac Herzog attend a joint press conference in Ankara, Turkey, on March 9, 2022.

It was the highest-level Israeli-Turkish meeting held in Turkey in 14 years.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu traveled to Israel in late May, in the first such visit in nearly 15 years. It was followed by the announcement in August by the two sides to restore full diplomatic ties, including returning ambassadors, after a phone talk held by Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and Erdogan.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R) and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi (L) shake hands on the sidelines of the 2022 World Cup in Doha, Qatar, Nov. 20, 2022.

Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the relations between the two neighbors have deteriorated.""Türkiye does not have the luxury of closing in, isolating itself from the outside world and watching the events in its region by sitting on the fence,"" Erdogan, who is facing a presidential election in 2023, said in an address to the Turkish parliament in October. He underlined that Türkiye does not ""seek escalation"" with other countries.After the breakout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Türkiye sought to strike a balance between the two sides.Türkiye supplied Ukraine with drones, supported a UN vote condemning Russia´s military operation, banned all combat ships from the Turkish straits, and blocked Syria-bound Russian aircraft from entering Turkish airspace. On the other hand, it opposed the Western sanctions on Russia, played an active role as a mediator in the conflict, and helped broker a deal to allow Ukrainian grain exports to reach global markets.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (C) meets with Russian and Ukrainian delegations before a fresh round of face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul, Turkey, March 29, 2022.Russia and Ukraine have concluded their fresh round of face-to-face peace talks here on Tuesday, which lasted for approximately three hours, according to media reports.

"Chaos, distrust, frustration -- Three years on, Britain still troubled by Brexit crisis - People's Daily Online","Chaos, distrust, frustration -- Three years on, Britain still troubled by Brexit crisis (Xinhua) 15:11, February 01, 2023Photo taken on Jan. 31, 2020 shows an image of the text ""UK VOTES OUT"" on a giant screen as pro-Brexit supporters celebrating Brexit at a gathering at Parliament Square in London, Britain. (Photo by Stephen Chung/Xinhua)The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January.LONDON, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- This January, three years after its departure from the European Union (EU) in 2020, Britain still suffers from division with parliament members continuing to pressure the prime minister on Brexit´s consequences during their weekly conventions.""It´s clear that Brexit and its hold over British politics remains strong,"" noted Sophie Stowers from the academic network UK in a Changing Europe. ""Britain has been split into two distinct camps: 'Leavers' and 'Remainers'.""Brexit chaos has showed no sign of stopping. The divorce has turned out to be long and unpleasant, full of quarrels and distrust, both inside Britain as well as between it and the bloc. As much evidence has showed, the British economy has suffered much, and frustration has grown over the unfulfilled promises. Worse yet, no quick solution is in sight.ECONOMIC TOLL""There´s now a reasonable consensus that the effects of Brexit on the UK economy have been negative,"" Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) told Xinhua. ""It´s more an incremental, small, bit-by-bit, drip-by-drip effect on the British economy. But it´s mainly been in one direction of being negative.""Evidence abounds that both households and businesses have been hit hard. Brexit added an average of 210 pounds (258.4 U.S. dollars) to household food bills in the EU over the two years to the end of 2021, and cost British consumers a total of 5.8 billion pounds (7.1 billion dollars) with higher food bills, research from the LSE Centre for Economic Performance showed in December 2022.A man stands at the entrance of a store in Basingstoke, Britain on Nov. 13, 2022. (Photo by Tim Ireland/Xinhua)""And since low-income households spend a greater share of their income on food than richer families, these Brexit-driven price rises had a proportionately greater impact on the poorest people,"" the study added.Companies have also felt the blow. Nearly half businesses still found Brexit challenging, while only a third could envisage opportunities materializing from Brexit, a report published by the Institute of Directors in November 2022 showed.Businesses said that they have lost clients as a result of Brexit, and that they have had to divert supply chains and relocate to the EU to keep trading, said the report, noting that EU firms are pulling out of Britain as an export market because of the barriers.""Businesses feel they are banging their heads against a brick wall as nothing has been done to help them,"" said Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""The longer the current problems go unchecked, the more EU traders go elsewhere, and the more damage is done.""Brexit has inevitably led to tax rises as well, because a slower-growing economy requires higher taxation to fund public services and benefits, said deputy director John Springford at the think tank Centre for European Reform. If Brexit had not happened, he added, most of the tax rises that the government announced in March 2022 would not have been necessary.A report published by think tank Resolution Foundation in June 2022 found that since 2019, Britain had experienced a sharp decline of 8 percentage points in trade openness, or total trade as a share of GDP. It´s estimated that labor productivity will be reduced by 1.3 percent by the end of the decade due to changes in trading rules alone.While the debate on the impact of Brexit has implied a one-off shock, adjustment will be gradual and create a lasting impact on Britain´s competitiveness and productivity over the coming decade, the report noted.BROKEN PROMISESOne of the illusory promises of Brexit was it would enable Britain to cut quick-and-easy trade deals, but this has not happened with the EU, by far its largest partner, nor with the United States, said John Kampfner from the policy institute Chatham House in a December 2022 article.Photo taken on Dec. 31, 2020 shows a general view of the Port of Dover, following the end of the Brexit Transition Period, in Dover, Britain. (Photo by Tim Ireland/Xinhua)""Considerable effort, and resource, has been expended on devising an independent trade policy. Once again, the results are limited,"" Kampfner noted. ""Much of Brexit´s Global Britain dream was based on reviving deeper relationships with the Commonwealth. Again, this is proving harder than originally envisaged.""The reality is that the vast majority of the 71 deals reached since Brexit are rollover agreements with countries that already had trade agreements with the EU, according to researcher Stephen Hunsaker at the UK in a Changing Europe in January. Even though the existing UK-Japan agreement was slightly modified, analysts cautioned that it will provide no net gain compared to the EU-Japan deal, Hunsaker added.Also, migration was quite a big deal in Brexit debates, but two years on from the end of free movement, the level of net migration certainly has not fallen, said Torsten Bell, chief executive at the Resolution Foundation.Statistics show net migration continued to add to the population in the year ending June 2022, with an estimated 504,000 more people arriving long-term to the UK than departing.""EU migration has decreased sharply, while there has been a substantial increase in non-EU migration. Combined with other factors, this has led to migration overall running at record levels,"" said a report published by UK in a Changing Europe in January.""The new system has seen increases in work visas in the health sector, and some other high-skilled service sectors, while other sectors, such as hospitality, which were previously more dependent on EU workers, are seeing labour shortages,"" it added.Regrets have been growing. The number of Leave voters who think it was wrong for Britain to vote leave the EU has been steadily increasing since 2021, hitting a record 19 percent in November 2022, YouGov data showed, identifying the top reason as ""just a general sense that things have gotten worse since Brexit.""Simon Wolfson, chief executive of the retailer Next, called for more foreign workers in Britain during a recent media interview. It is ""not the Brexit I wanted,"" said the Brexit supporter.CONTINUED CHAOSA dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol, the rules governing post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, has strained Britain´s relations with the EU, even stoking worries of a trade war. Tension grew when the British government in June 2022 introduced a bill to unilaterally change parts of the protocol, which the EU said was not acceptable.A vehicle moves past a border sign near Newry, Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, on June 14, 2022. (Photo by Colum Lynch/Xinhua)Under the protocol, Northern Ireland is part of British customs territory but is subject to the EU´s customs code, value-added tax rules and single market rules for goods. However, a de facto Irish Sea border was thus created between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, meaning goods transported to and from Northern Ireland are subject to border controls.This has elicited firm opposition from Northern Ireland´s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, which has demanded the removal or replacement of the protocol as a precondition for it to sit in the assembly and form a devolved government. Political chaos has continued.The British government´s approach to resolving the problems with the protocol has been counterproductive and has further undermined trust, said Hilary Benn, the Labour Member of Parliament for Leeds Central, in September 2022.""One of the most striking features of Brexit is that those who argued most strongly for it appear unwilling to take any responsibility for its consequences. Nowhere has this been demonstrated more clearly than in the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Benn noted.More recently, with efforts to heal the rifts, progress was made in Britain-EU talks. Nevertheless, gaps remained, and analysts expect a long road ahead for the two sides to settle their disputes.The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January. ""What seems clear, however, is that the relationship is far from settled. Brexit will not be 'done' for a while yet.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0201/c90000-10202028.html,1,2,2023,"['brexit', 'britain', 'eu', 'ireland', 'british', 'northern', 'report', 'added', 'trade', 'migration', 'protocol', 'changing', 'europe', 'january', 'showed', 'years', 'political', 'noted', 'economy', 'businesses']",0.40367875180375185

This will allow them to not only meet Ukraine´s needs on the frontline but also to replenish the NATO and EU member states' ammunition stockpiles.Since the consumption rate of ammunition is greater than the production rate, the EU and NATO member states need to ramp up production, Stoltenberg and Borrell said. Efforts to ramp up production started at the end of last summer, according to Kuleba.NATO will help Ukraine develop a procurement system that is effective, transparent and accountable, Stoltenberg said. The alliance will also increase its targets for ammunition stockpiles through its Defense Planning Process.Stoltenberg said he regretted Russia´s decision to suspend its participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States, which was announced earlier on Tuesday by Russia´s President Vladimir Putin.Russia suspends participation in New START rather than withdraws from it, Putin said.In early February, NATO called on Russia to ""return to full compliance"" with New START and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. That ""sounds like some kind of nonsense amid today´s confrontation,"" Putin said in his annual address to Russia´s Federal Assembly.He pointed to the combined strike potential of NATO as the United Kingdom and France also have nuclear arsenals that pose a threat to Russia.Moscow said it had information that ""certain figures in Washington"" are considering conducting tests to develop new types of nuclear weapons. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0222/c90000-10211233.html,22,2,2023,"['nato', 'ukraine', 'russia', 'eu', 'production', 'ramp', 'arms', 'stoltenberg', 'states', 'procurement', 'borrell', 'weapons', 'member', 'ammunition', 'start', 'putin', 'nuclear', 'february', 'treaty', 'mechanism']",0.4801978973407544

(People´s Daily Online/Gu Changwang)As international organizations and investment institutions lifted their forecast on China´s economic growth this year, the international community has gained stronger confidence in the Chinese economy.There is an increasingly prevalent view that China will be a major driver of global recovery. It is anticipated that the Chinese economy will embrace brighter prospects and once again become the largest contributor to global growth.The lifted expectations on China´s growth mirror the country´s strong economic resilience.According to the recent World Economic Outlook report issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), growth in China is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in 2023, 0.8 percentage points higher than its previous forecast, and China´s economic growth will contribute around a quarter of global growth.The United Nations' World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2023 report said China´s economy is expected to grow by 4.8 percent this year, leading the economic recovery in East Asia.Besides, many international investment institutions including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and JPMorgan have lifted their forecasts on China´s economic growth in 2023.Yachts are seen sailing on the water in Sanya, south China´s Hainan province, Feb. 7, 2023. (People´s Daily Online/Ye Longbin)Bloomberg said on its website that China´s reopening is set to provide a welcome boost to global growth.China´s optimized COVID-19 response is the most direct reason for the international community to raise the economic growth forecast of the country.Consumer market figures grew sharply during the just-ended Chinese New Year holiday, sending a strong signal of recovery. According to the latest statistics, the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China´s manufacturing sector regained expansion this January, which also indicated a stable economic rebound.American weekly magazine Barron´s said that all the switches that can be switched on have been moved toward growth in China, and there´s a lot of momentum behind it.China, maintaining its commodity price at a relatively low level, has convinced the international community of its ample room for keeping proactive fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies.Last year, some countries witnessed soaring energy and food prices. For instance, the consumer price index (CPI) in December 2022 grew 6.5 percent year on year in the United States, 9.2 percent in the eurozone and 10.5 percent in the United Kingdom.A teacher and her students watch homemade lanterns at an elementary school in Changxing county, Huzhou, east China´s Zhejiang province, Feb. 6, 2023. (People´s Daily Online/Zhou Hongfeng)Global economic activities will still bear the pressure from high inflation this year. To bring inflation down and prevent the global economy from falling into recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, and the European Central Bank and the Bank of England followed this move to hike interest rates by 50 basis points.In contrast, China´s commodity price is generally stable. The country´s CPI rose 2 percent from a year ago in 2022.Vice President of the BRICS New Development Bank Leslie Maasdorp said China has ample fiscal space, which enables it to better adapt its economy following the recovery.To predict economic trends calls for studies into both short-term dynamic and long-term growth momentums.Boasting a population of more than 1.4 billion, per capita GDP of over $12,000 and 400 million middle-income earners, China is the world´s most promising super-large market. This makes China enjoy enormous advantages in its economic size, innovative development and impact-resistance capability.China has the biggest and most complete manufacturing system in the world and is among the world´s largest producers of over 220 industrial products. It possesses a vital position in the global division of labor system and supply chain system, and has strong supply capability in building a new development paradigm.Photo taken on Feb. 7, 2023 shows the Xinhai ro-ro passenger terminal in Haikou, south China´s Hainan province.

The country´s economic growth will be a stabilizer for both global and regional growth, he added.China is the world´s second-largest economy. Its economic recovery is crucially important for the world.The country will strive to reach its major economic goals this year and make progress in high-quality development with new accomplishments.

"Yearender: Fruitful cooperation in 2022 as China, Uganda celebrate six-decade ties - People's Daily Online","Yearender: Fruitful cooperation in 2022 as China, Uganda celebrate six-decade ties (Xinhua) 10:03, December 30, 2022KAMPALA, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- The year 2022 has been fruitful for China-Uganda cooperation as the two countries celebrated 60 years of diplomatic ties.A month into 2022, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), together with France´s TotalEnergies, announced the long-awaited 10-billion-U.S.-dollar Final Investment Decision, a blueprint plan to start commercial production of Uganda´s oil. This was a signal of the deepening ties between Uganda and China, dating back to Oct. 18, 1962, just nine days after the east African country attained political independence from the United Kingdom.At an event held at the national ceremonial ground, Kololo Independence Ground, Kampala, the capital of Uganda, on Feb. 1, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni told the country and the world that once the first oil starts flowing in 2025, the revenues would be used to fast-track the country´s economic development, especially in the transport and energy infrastructure sectors.Economic experts from entities including Uganda´s central bank, the Bank of Uganda, have argued that proper utilization of Uganda´s oil revenue will fast-track its economic development, pulling millions out of poverty.Months into 2022, drilling activities have started in the oil wells in the western part of the country on the shores of Lake Albert, shared with the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Chinese drilling experts together with their Ugandan experts are already at Kingfisher oilfield, which is owned by CNOOC. Works are also ongoing at Tilenga oil fields which are owned by TotalEnergies. A 1,445-km crude oil pipeline, estimated to cost 3.55 billion dollars, will be constructed to transport the oil to the international market through the Tanzanian seaport of Tanga. Uganda´s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development estimates that the oil project will generate about 160,000 jobs besides provisions of goods and services.The Chinese Embassy in Uganda this year also announced that as a follow-up of the nine cooperation programs announced at last year´s Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), it has together with the Ugandan government developed a pool of projects aimed at increasing household income. These projects include mushroom and bamboo growing at a commercial level, according to Zhang Lizhong, Chinese ambassador to Uganda.Also as a follow-up on the eighth ministerial FOCAC meeting, China this year extended up to 98 percent of Ugandan goods to access the Chinese market at zero tariffs, starting Dec. 1. China pledged to increase the scope of products enjoying zero tariff treatment for the least developed countries that have diplomatic ties with it in a bid to reach 300 billion U.S. dollars in total imports from Africa in the next three years.Uganda´s Minister for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives Francis Mwebesa, while speaking at the public unveiling of the Special Preferential Tariff Treatment of Ugandan Exports to China held in Kampala on Nov. 18, urged the business community to take advantage of the Chinese market access.""To export to China, it is the best market we can access, the private sector especially those in coffee should access the Chinese market,"" Mwebesa said.China has since 2010 been increasing the number of Ugandan goods that can access its market tariff-free. According to Uganda´s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperative, China in 2013 increased the zero tariff line to 95 percent from 60 percent in 2010. In 2015, the zero tariff line was further increased to 97 percent.The trade volume between the two countries in 2021 amounted to 1.07 billion dollars, registering a 28.5 percent increase, against the shock waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of 2020, China´s direct investment in Uganda reached 710 million dollars and the investment is mainly focused on manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and logistics.This year, China and Uganda also commemorated their 60th anniversary since the establishment of diplomatic ties. At a webinar held in September, organized by the Chinese People´s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), the Chinese Embassy in Uganda, and the Ugandan Embassy in China, speakers on both sides hailed the bilateral ties on international affairs.Vice President of CPAFFC Jiang Jiang said China supported African countries to fight imperialism and colonialism. Africa also supported China´s restoration of the lawful seat at the United Nations in 1971, signaling deep ties between the two sides.""African brothers have withstood tremendous pressure, carried China to the United Nations, and always firmly supported China in safeguarding its legitimate rights and interests and core interests on international occasions,"" Jiang said.Uganda´s Ambassador to China Oliver Wonekha said China has been playing a central role in building transport and energy infrastructure in Uganda. China is financing the expansion of the country´s Entebbe International Airport, the main gateway to the world. China also financed the construction of the Kampala-Entebbe expressway linking the national capital of Kampala to the airport. In the energy sector, China financed the construction of the Karuma Hydro Power Plant and Isimba Hydro Power Plant which helped address Uganda´s energy deficit, a major bottleneck to the country´s development, the ambassador said.A report issued this month titled ""Chinese Enterprises Social Responsibility Report 2022"" showed that Chinese enterprises in Uganda are deepening the people-to-people ties between local and Chinese communities through their corporate social responsibility work.The report, which sampled 21 out of 129 member enterprises of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Uganda, showed that the enterprises have supported local communities by providing medical camps, scholarships, knowledge and skills training, and renovation of schools, among others.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1230/c90000-10190197.html,30,12,2022,"['china', 'uganda', 'oil', 'ties', 'ugandan', 'country', 'market', 'kampala', 'countries', 'energy', 'access', 'tariff', 'cooperation', 'billion', 'development', 'dollars', 'international', 'supported', 'enterprises', 'diplomatic']",0.22637648809523814

(Photo by Jon Super/Xinhua)Mortgage rates were still over three times higher than they were a year ago, pricing many out of the market, while many more potential buyers would fail lenders' affordability tests, which had become tougher to pass since the central bank has hiked the bank rate, said Gabriella Dickens, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy.At the same time, households' real disposable incomes would be squeezed further in the second quarter by the watering down of government support for energy bills, Dickens added.Earlier this month, a report published by mortgage provider Nationwide Building Society also showed that annual house price growth slowed to 1.1 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December.Month-on-month, January saw a further price fall of 0.6 percent, which left prices 3.2 percent lower than their August peak after taking account of seasonal effects. The monthly decline was the fourth in a row, marking the longest period of consecutive falls since 2009.""Nationwide´s data show that house prices are continuing to buckle under the pressure of elevated mortgage rates, squeezed real incomes and weakened consumer confidence,"" Dickens said.Photo taken on Sept. 2, 2020 shows estate agency signs in Reading, Britain.

The annual rate of house price growth slowed to 1.9 percent in January, the lowest level recorded over the last three years, down from 2.1 percent in December.""We expected that the squeeze on household incomes from the rising cost of living and higher interest rates would lead to a slower housing market, particularly compared to the rapid growth of recent years,"" said Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages.""As we move through 2023, that trend is likely to continue as higher borrowing costs lead to reduced demand,"" Kinnaird added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0210/c90000-10206035.html,10,2,2023,"['market', 'rates', 'january', 'mortgage', 'prices', 'housing', 'house', 'incomes', 'amid', 'britain', 'elevated', 'squeezed', 'real', 'survey', 'rics', 'showed', 'minus', 'december', 'higher', 'dickens']",0.3580452249770432

""Their comeback is crucial to help boost the recovery of our tourism industry.""The arrival of the Chinese tourists came as China, one of the world´s largest outbound tourism markets in the pre-pandemic era, resumed outbound group tours.Starting from Monday, China resumed outbound group tours to 20 countries, including Cambodia, Thailand, the Maldives, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and New Zealand.China was the largest source of foreign tourists to Cambodia in the pre-pandemic era, a Ministry of Tourism´s report said, adding that the kingdom received 2.36 million Chinese tourists in 2019, generating about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in revenue.Cambodian Tourism Minister Thong Khon said the Southeast Asian nation is projected to attract at least 1 million Chinese tourists in 2023, an expected increase from merely 110,000 in 2022.""China is the most important outbound tourism market for the world, so China´s resumption of outbound tourism is very beneficial not only to Cambodia, but also to the whole world,"" he told Xinhua.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0207/c90000-10204134.html,7,2,2023,"['tourists', 'tourism', 'tour', 'cambodia', 'group', 'china', 'outbound', 'pandemic', 'phnom', 'penh', 'monday', 'kingdom', 'travel', 'operators', 'airport', 'city', 'cambodian', 'sivlin', 'ministry', 'arrival']",0.3490404040404041
Win-win China-Arab ties cooperate more - People's Daily Online,"Win-win China-Arab ties cooperate moreBy Ma Xiaolin (China Daily) 14:58, December 07, 2022With the United States' strategic presence shrinking in the Middle East and Russia occupied with the Ukraine conflict, China has played an increasingly prominent role in the region. And since Arab countries now attach greater value to relations with China, the region is bound to become an increasingly important platform for China´s diplomacy.China is a stakeholder in the geopolitics of the Middle East, where most Arab countries are, because the region connects five important waterways, has been a battleground for military strategists throughout history and served as a bridge between China and Europe on the ancient Silk Road. Thanks to its extremely important geographical position, the Arabian region is bound to be a buffer between China and the United States and Europe.The Arabic civilization in the Middle East, the Confucian civilization of China and the Western Christian civilization represented by Europe and the US are together called the great triangle of world civilizations.These civilizations have blended, but also collided, with each other during exchanges, while developing together as well as restricting each other. In a process lasting more than 1,000 years, 10 ethnic groups in China converted to Islam, thus adding another diverse element to the Chinese nation and civilization. This shows that members of different civilizations can live together in peace and resolve their differences through dialogue.As an important part of the developing world and the Non-Aligned Movement, Middle East countries have played (and are playing) a very important role in the development of China´s diplomacy and multilateral relations. That New China could break the Western diplomatic boycott and blockade, return to the United Nations and become an important player in the international political arena was made possible partly due to the understanding and support of the Middle East countries.In recent years, China and the Arab countries have reached many consensuses on issues such as human rights, democratization of international relations, and building a multipolar world order. When it comes to China´s core interests, no matter how many differences the Middle East countries have, the four major players — Arab countries, Turkey, Israel and Iran — have always understood China´s position and supported it, which makes the region China´s core base on the international stage.With limited resources, relatively insufficient workforce and unbalanced economic development, the region is economically complementary to China. China´s initial overseas engineering projects and labor export since the launch of reform and opening-up all positioned the Arab region as the main market. Such exchanges helped increase China´s foreign exchange earnings, made it more familiar with international rules and consolidated its diplomatic relations with other countries.The China-Arab regional trade volume has increased by nearly 80 times — from less than $3 billion in 1990 to about $300 billion in 2021 — and China has become the largest trading partner of the region.In particular, the Belt and Road Initiative has accelerated two-way economic, trade and investment activities. For example, China is helping Egypt´s industrialization and Saudi Arabia´s economic diversification, while improving the overall development level in the Middle East.Also, China is the largest importer of oil and gas from the Middle East, which holds 70 percent and 50 percent of the global oil and natural gas reserves.Since China became a net importer of oil in 1993, its energy imports have doubled every 10 years, of which 60 percent comes from the Middle East. In 2021, China´s total oil imports reached 51,298 million metric tons, with the Middle East accounting for 51.25 percent of that, with the exception of Iran, which once accounted for a high percentage of China´s energy imports but has been forced to drastically cut oil exports due to US sanctions.China has suggested ways to resolve or reduce conflicts in the Middle East. It is the only major country that has no record of colonization, or staging invasion or proxy wars in the Middle East. It has always believed that it is the people who should decide the fate of their country, and countries should settle their disputes through peaceful talks.At the beginning of the Gulf War in 1990, China worked as a mediator, trying to persuade Saddam Hussein´s government to end its occupation of Kuwait and avoid war. In 2002, China appointed its first Middle East special envoy dedicated to mediating between the Palestinians and Israelis to help resolve their disputes. In 2003 before the Iraq War, it advocated peaceful resolution, but the US, the United Kingdom and other US allies still resorted to military means. And when the Libyan crisis broke out in 2011, China accepted the decision of the League of Arab States and didn't veto Security Council Resolution 1973, and asked the Libyan government and opposition to settle their disputes through talks.But China, along with Russia, used its veto powers in the Security Council many a time when it came to the Syrian crisis, in order to thwart the West´s attempts to subvert, even overthrow, the legitimate Syrian government. Most dispensations in the Middle East, including the Syrian government and the opposition, lauded China for its efforts. China has also played the mediator´s role in the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan, something which other major powers have not done.China is strongly against extremism, violence and terrorism, but it has participated in only justified anti-terrorism operations in the Middle East, reflecting its respect for multiculturalism and the values which other civilizations hold high. It also demonstrates China´s belief in the principle that extremism and terrorism are not associated with a specific ethnic group or faith.As a matter of fact, China advocates that global cooperation to fight terrorism be based on international law and respect for the sovereignty and dignity of all countries, a position which has been welcomed by Middle East countries.In accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China is practicing major country diplomacy, playing a responsible international role, and highlighting the importance of Middle East countries' diplomacy in international relations.Still, China´s diplomacy in the Middle East is in its primary stage. It largely lags behind that of the US in comprehensive strength, and Russia in diplomatic and military capabilities. Also, its soft power and geographical position still cannot rival those of Europe, especially the UK and France. Therefore, China´s cooperation with the Arab countries still has a lot of potential to tap.The author is the dean of and a professor at the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1207/c90000-10180813.html,7,12,2022,"['china', 'middle', 'east', 'countries', 'arab', 'region', 'international', 'important', 'relations', 'diplomacy', 'oil', 'united', 'role', 'europe', 'position', 'civilization', 'civilizations', 'major', 'government', 'terrorism']",0.3419070403280929

OU DONGQU/XINHUAIn the past 12 months, Chinese experts provided the impetus for many discoveries.Zhang Zhihao reports.Fostering quality scientific talent, employing innovation to serve the country´s strategic needs and achieving major milestones in research capacities were last year´s highlights for China´s science and technology sector.Science and technology underpinned many of the nation´s biggest achievements, including hosting the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, finding new engines for socioeconomic growth and completing construction of the Tiangong Space Station.Last year, the country climbed one place to 11th out of 132 economies on the Global Innovation Ranking 2022, published by the World Intellectual Property Organization. China was the only middle-income economy to make it into the top 20.The country topped nine indicators out of the roughly 80 criteria used by the list to measure innovation capacity, including: domestic market size; the number of companies offering formal training; patients by origin; growth of labor productivity; trademarks by origin; industrial designs by origin; and exports of creative goods.For the first time, China had as many top 100 science and technology clusters as the United States, with 21 apiece, according to WIPO.Meanwhile, Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou was the world´s second-most innovative sci-tech cluster, with Beijing in third place.Speaking via a video address to the publication ceremony of the Global Innovation Ranking 2022 in September, Wang Zhigang, minister of science and technology, said that over the past decade, China´s science and technology sector has seen historic and profound changes. ""China has been a key participant in global frontier science, technology and innovation, as well as a key contributor to jointly solving global challenges,"" he said.He added that China will facilitate opening-up and international cooperation, actively integrate into the global innovation network and foster bigger and deeper collaboration in science and technology.In an article published last month, Hou Jianguo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that a country´s research capability in basic sciences is the foundation for supporting innovation and the basis of China´s pursuit of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency in science and technology.The academy will help optimize policies to support scientific research and regulations on cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology, he said, noting that it will also build a more effective innovation mechanism, nurture world-class scientists and promote open sciences and international cooperation.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0103/c90000-10191270.html,3,1,2023,"['china', 'innovation', 'science', 'technology', 'global', 'country', 'research', 'origin', 'sciences', 'sci', 'tech', 'nation', 'strategic', 'zhang', 'zhihao', 'past', 'scientific', 'sector', 'including', 'beijing']",0.38324314574314566

"UK-China trading momentum to continue this year, say experts - People's Daily Online","UK-China trading momentum to continue this year, say experts (Xinhua) 10:46, February 18, 2023LONDON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- As China was among the United Kingdom´s (UK) largest trading partners in 2022 and with a steady increase in bilateral trade flows, experts are confident that this momentum will continue in 2023.The UK´s trade with China has continued to flourish, which reflects the strong and deep trade relationship between the two countries, John McLean, chair of the Institute of Directors (IoD) London, has told Xinhua in a recent written interview.In particular, services exports have increased, which is a testament to the UK´s financial and insurance expertise and a reflection of the growing opportunities that now exist in China, McLean said.Since China is among the UK´s largest export markets, the UK benefits as more exports equal more jobs, which is good for the country´s economy, McLean said.UK-China trade in goods also increased in 2022, as China was the second largest trading partner in goods imports for the UK and the fifth largest in goods exports, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said earlier this month.""With the opening up of travel and a resulting increase in people-to-people exchanges, I expect the overall UK exports to China to continue to grow,"" he noted, adding that he was ""optimistic"" that ""the trade engagement between China and the UK will strengthen"" this year.This week in London, McLean, also chair of the UK-China Business Development Center, welcomed a delegation from the Chinese coastal city of Ningbo, which he said was an opportunity to strengthen business ties between the two sides.In his welcome speech, McLean noted that over the last three years affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, ""we are now entering calmer COVID waters and for the UK it is now time to refresh our engagement with China and positively progress our bilateral relationship.""With UK´s ""strengths in finance, technology and innovation"" and Ningbo´s ""developed economy and active international engagement"" as ""a vibrant city with a first-class port"", he said, ""We are full of confidence in continuing to promote cooperation between the UK and Ningbo.""Gordon C.K. Cheung, associate professor in international relations of China at Durham University, said he was also confident in the two countries' trade ties.One way to understand the increase in UK exports to China was the impact of Brexit on UK´s trade with the European Union (EU), Cheung told Xinhua in a written interview. ""The UK is trying to export more goods and services to China to compensate for the loss on the EU front.""On the other hand, he added, although the geopolitical drumbeat was noticeable between the UK and China last year, the reality was that businesspeople were putting their money where their mouths were, and that was reflected clearly in the trading data.Given that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already revised China´s economic growth rate to 5.2 percent in 2023, the country´s purchasing power should increase and therefore trade between the UK and China should improve in 2023, Cheung said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209526.html,18,2,2023,"['china', 'trade', 'mclean', 'exports', 'trading', 'largest', 'increase', 'goods', 'continue', 'london', 'engagement', 'ningbo', 'international', 'cheung', 'momentum', 'experts', 'bilateral', 'confident', 'relationship', 'countries']",0.3379935720844811

New US charging station regulations to have limited impact on Chinese firms - People's Daily Online,"New US charging station regulations to have limited impact on Chinese firms (Chinadaily.com.cn) 15:49, February 17, 2023A resident in Baofeng county, Henan province, charges his new energy vehicle, on Nov 26, 2021. [Photo/Xinhua]The new US regulations for electric vehicle charging stations will have a limited impact on Chinese enterprises, Yicai.com reported on Friday, citing responses from charging station manufacturers in China.The rules announced on Feb 15 require all federally funded electric vehicle charging stations to be produced in the United States. Additionally, starting July 2024, at least 55 percent of the charging station´s component costs must come from the United States.As a result of this news, the A-share charging station sector, which had been exceptionally hot recently, suddenly cooled down. As of the close of trading on Feb 16, the sector index fell by 3.43 percent, with companies that had previously announced overseas expansion plans leading the decline, including Juhua Technology, Daotong Technology, and Shenghong, according to the report.However, US EV maker Tesla said the plan to produce charging stations domestically in the United States was too aggressive. Tesla has told the US Department of Transportation that, given the speed and scale of deployment, the new regulations could lead to an insufficient number of compliant charging stations.US companies in the industry have also said that global demand for electric vehicle charging stations is putting pressure on the supply chain, making it difficult to meet US manufacturing standards and accelerate the construction of new charging stations. They argue that requiring localization of parts too early could hinder the expansion of the charging network.In addition to charging stations, the United States also passed the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" in August last year, aiming to accelerate the localization process of electric vehicle batteries. The new law strengthens ""Made in America"" requirements, demanding that electric vehicles must be assembled in North America, and the materials and ""critical minerals"" in the batteries must come from the United States or countries that have a free trade agreement with the United States. Otherwise, consumers purchasing new electric vehicles will not be able to receive a $7,500 government subsidy.The above regulations have also directly impacted the progress of Contemporary Amperex Technology´s factory construction in the United States. Recently, in order to enter the US market, CATL has decided to adopt a new cooperative construction model with Ford, in which Ford will provide funding and CATL will provide technology to circumvent the restrictions of the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" regulations.Compared to the domestic market, the overseas new energy vehicle market has a more severe imbalance between the number of vehicles and the number of charging stations, which contains greater market dividends.According to a research report from Everbright Securities, as of April 2022, the ratio of the number of electric vehicles to the number of charging stations in the United States was 21.2:1, while in the European Union was 8.5:1, with Germany at 20:1, the United Kingdom at 16:1, France at 10:1, and the Netherlands at 5:1, all showing significant gaps compared to China.As of the end of 2022, the ratio of new energy vehicles to charging stations in China was about 2.6:1, meaning that 2.6 new energy vehicles could share one charging station.Due to the strong demand from overseas markets, many Chinese-listed companies in the charging station business have disclosed their layout in overseas markets in 2022.""Currently, the new regulations in the United States do not have much impact on domestic charging station companies because the number of charging stations exported to the United States by domestic companies is relatively small,"" said a manager of a charging station production company to the reporter of Yicai.com.Daotong Technology said the regulation will have a relatively small impact on the company, as it has taken the policy´s impact into account when formulating its 2023 sales targets. In response to the policy requirements, the company is planning to build a factory in the United States, which is expected to be established and put into operation by the end of 2023.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0217/c90000-10209411.html,17,2,2023,"['charging', 'united', 'stations', 'states', 'station', 'electric', 'regulations', 'vehicle', 'number', 'vehicles', 'impact', 'companies', 'technology', 'energy', 'overseas', 'market', 'china', 'construction', 'domestic', 'company']",0.37792514813791406

These are: to halve inflation; to grow the economy; to reduce national debt; to cut hospital waiting lists; and to stop illegal migrant boats crossing the English Channel.Calling these the ""people´s priorities,"" Sunak vowed to ""work night and day"" to deliver for the British people.Britain´s new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak waves to the crowd after delivering his first address to the nation outside 10 Downing Street in London, Britain, Oct. 25, 2022. (Xinhua/Li Ying)He said his government will halve inflation this year to reduce the cost of living and give people financial security. According to official figures, the UK´s annual inflation dipped to 10.7 percent in November from 11.1 percent in October.Last November, the Bank of England (BoE) said it expected the country´s consumer price index (CPI) to drop sharply after the middle of 2023.To grow the economy, Sunak pledged to create better-paid jobs and opportunities across the country. However, this may prove to be an uphill task.According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK´s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.3 percent in the third quarter of 2022. The BoE also warned that the country´s economy is bound to remain in recession throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, and GDP will recover only gradually thereafter.Photo taken on March 23, 2022 shows British coins in Basingstoke, Britain.

In his Autumn Statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a package of tax hikes and spending cuts in a bid to improve the public finances and restore the country´s economic credibility.In Sunak´s fourth pledge, he promised that the waiting lists of the National Health Service (NHS) will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly. According to the British Medical Association (BMA), in October 2022, a record 7.21 million people were waiting for medical treatment in the UK.Sunak also vowed to pass new laws to curb the arrival of migrants in ""small boats,"" on the country´s coast. ""If you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed,"" he said.Migrants arrive on a beach in Dungeness, Britain on Nov. 24, 2021. (Photo by Steve Finn/Xinhua)The Times newspaper cited official figures as showing that a record 45,756 migrants crossed the English Channel to the UK last year.In his speech, Sunak also said that he plans to ensure that all pupils in the country study maths until the age of 18.He said the UK was one of the few countries in the world not to require children to study maths in some form up to that age.""Improving education,"" he said, ""is the closest thing to a silver bullet there is.

Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses - People's Daily Online,"Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses (Xinhua) 13:39, February 05, 2023LONDON, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat to global public health, the World Health Organization (WHO) last month calls for the momentum for vaccination to be maintained to better cover high-priority groups.The vaccine uptake in low- and middle-income countries is still insufficient, which became a concern about the ongoing risk, according to the WHO.The world has been struggling to tackle the problem of unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between rich and lower-income countries. Yet, years after the outbreak of the pandemic, promises made by many rich countries have yet to be delivered.""No one is safe until everyone is safe,"" said Seth Berkley, CEO of the global vaccine alliance Gavi.EMPTY PROMISESAccording to figures from Our World in Data, as early as two years ago, developed countries had already acquired enough doses to vaccinate their population more than one shot for each. But even now, many Western developed countries have not yet fulfilled their promises to deliver vaccines to low-income countries.There are currently nearly 400 million doses of vaccines announced by the United States but not yet donated, according to the data. For the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the number is 41 million and 6.2 million.Commenting on the low vaccination rates in low-income countries, Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, told Xinhua in an earlier interview that ""the delay in vaccines getting to them has really been intolerable.""Last month at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland, Hatchett urged countries and manufacturers to prioritize vaccine supply to the global program COVAX.VACCINES DESTROYEDAccording to a report by qz.com last October, Canada destroyed nearly 14 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses in early 2022. Switzerland was also reported to destroy more than 14 million doses of vaccines, which was more than four times the doses it donated to low-income countries.What also worsened the global accessibility of vaccines is that some low-income countries had to turn down the offering of vaccine doses that were due to expire soon, or had to destroy such doses.In May 2021, Malawi destroyed nearly 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, which arrived in the country at the end of March but would expire on April 13.In an article published in the Sunday Mirror newspaper in 2021, WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing Gordon Brown said the West´s stockpile of COVID-19 vaccine is growing by the day but many poorer parts of the world are missing out.""We must act now,"" said the former British prime minister.IMMUNITY GAPThe obvious gap between immunity in rich and poorer countries has drawn the attention of many experts. Many have warned that the longer the unequal vaccine distribution exists, the wider COVID-19 spreads, and new variants are more likely to emerge.Extremely unequal vaccine distribution has typified the availability of vaccines across countries, said a study published in August 2022 in the UK journal Communications Medicine. ""In an unequal world with open economies, pandemics do not stop at national borders,"" it stressed.Since about 85 percent of the global population resides in low- and middle-income countries, most of humanity remains exposed to continued outbreaks, the study said, adding that this situation increases the risk that further virus variants will emerge, possibly undermining the efficacy of existing vaccines.Most people in the world´s poorest countries might not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until at least mid-2023, it said.""We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world´s population, not just the wealthy parts,"" said Berkley.As long as large portions of the world´s population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged, he said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0205/c90000-10203404.html,5,2,2023,"['countries', 'vaccines', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'global', 'low', 'income', 'covid', 'million', 'unequal', 'population', 'variants', 'pandemic', 'health', 'distribution', 'rich', 'switzerland', 'accessibility', 'urged', 'western']",0.36093130855035616
World awaits return of Chinese tourists - People's Daily Online,"World awaits return of Chinese touristsBy Jinith de Silva (China Daily) 15:07, February 13, 2023　　(MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY)Before the COVID-19 pandemic, China was the world´s most important source of international travelers, and Chinese tourists were the biggest overseas spenders. According to the United Nations' World Tourism Organization, Chinese tourists spent $255 billion overseas and made 166 million overseas trips in 2019.Tourism expenditure is an important criterion to determine the health of a country´s tourism industry. With a population of more than 1.4 billion, massive increase in economic power and remarkable improvements in people´s living standards, China became the most important source of outbound tourists who were also the biggest overseas spenders.During the past three years, however, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many Chinese people to forgo international travel and cut household spending. But now that the suppressed spending power is likely to be unleashed thanks to China easing the prevention and control measures, there could be a huge explosion in spending by Chinese tourists.The pace of China´s reopening is of significance to the global tourism industry. Tourism officials and professionals in many countries are looking forward to the mass return of Chinese tourists as early as possible, because they could fuel the recovery of the tourism sector worldwide and promote cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.Several Southeast Asian countries that depend, to a large extent, on tourism have kept entry rules relatively relaxed for Chinese tourists despite the recent COVID-19 outbreaks in China. They include Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. New Zealand, too, has waived testing requirements for Chinese visitors, who were the second-largest source of tourism revenue for the country before the pandemic.After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and China, the two countries took a number of steps in the political, economic, trade and cultural fields to strengthen bilateral ties. Thanks to the strong bilateral relations, cultural familiarity and reliable visa policies, a large number of Chinese tourists visit Sri Lanka every year. In fact, China is one of the top three sources of tourists for Sri Lanka, with 167,863 Chinese tourist arrivals being recorded in Sri Lanka in 2019.Tourism is the third-largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. The tourism industry of Sri Lanka, which was dealt a catastrophic blow by the pandemic, now has the opportunity to recover rapidly. And it is all set to welcome Chinese tourists, especially because the island country´s government has adopted a series of new policies to attract Chinese travelers.In order to draw more Chinese tourists, hotels in Sri Lanka have introduced Digital QR Chinese menus. Hotel experts say their intention is to make Chinese people feel welcome and provide the exquisite traveling experience for them.Sri Lanka has been ranked first among the top 24 countries to visit in 2023 by travel site Travel Triangle. According to Travel Triangle, golden beaches, wildlife-rich forests, rolling tea plantations, and mist-shrouded mountains make Sri Lanka one of the best Asian countries to visit. Also, Sri Lanka is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites.To begin with, there are the ruins of the ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura in the North Central Province, which flourished from the 5th century BC to the 10th century CE. There are also the ruins of the successor kingdom, Polonnaruwa (9th-14th century), and the incredible Sigiriya Rock fortress in the northern Matale district in Central Province.The entire city of Kandy (the seat of kings from the 16th to the 19th century) with its revered temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as are the Dambulla caves and temple dating from the 1st century BC. Galle Fort, begun by the Portuguese in 1588, too, is on UNESCO´s heritage list. The two natural landmarks on the list are the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the Central Highlands (Peak Wilderness, Horton Plains and the Knuckles Conservation Forest.)No wonder China´s Ministry of Culture and Tourism has announced that Sri Lanka will be among the countries in its outbound tourism pilot program, which started on Feb 6.Sri Lanka´s tourism revenue fell precipitously in the past three years as the country more or less closed its borders during the pandemic. But, with China ""reopening"" after three years, millions of tourists are poised to travel across the world, raising hopes of a rebound of the hospitality industry and an increase in employment in Sri Lanka. This proves the importance of China to global tourism.The resumption of outbound travel by the Chinese people, which used to be a considerable source of revenue for economies that depend heavily on tourism, will help revive the tourism sector and promote cultural exchanges at the international level.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0213/c90000-10206955.html,13,2,2023,"['tourism', 'sri', 'lanka', 'china', 'tourists', 'travel', 'countries', 'pandemic', 'century', 'overseas', 'country', 'industry', 'cultural', 'covid', 'important', 'international', 'outbound', 'years', 'spending', 'revenue']",0.31746466385020594

(Xinhua/Li Ying)UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Thursday urged people who plan to travel abroad to ""think carefully"" because they may well be impacted.LONDON, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- The wave of strikes over pay that has hit the United Kingdom (UK) since the early days of December appears to continue unabated, and the labor actions now also threaten traffic at the country´s airports and railway stations. Public discontent is on the rise.HOLIDAY CHAOSBorder Force workers at locations in England, Scotland and Wales, including the country´s biggest airport Heathrow, plan to go on strike for eight days in December, the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) said on Wednesday.The industrial action comes after 100,000 PCS members in government departments and other public bodies voted to walk out demanding a 10 percent pay rise, pensions justice and job security.""Like so many workers, our members are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. They are desperate,"" PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka said.UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Thursday urged people who plan to travel abroad to ""think carefully"" because they may well be impacted.A double-decker bus runs on Oxford Street decorated with Christmas lights in central London, Britain, on Nov. 29, 2022. (Xinhua/Li Ying)The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) also announced on Wednesday that an industrial action by more than 40,000 railway workers throughout December, including the Christmas holidays, will go ahead as scheduled.On Sunday, the RMT rejected a 4 percent pay rise offer in 2022 and 2023 from the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents 14 train companies, noting that the offer was conditional on RMT members accepting significant changes to working practices and huge job losses.""We have rejected this offer as it does not meet any of our criteria for securing a settlement on long-term job security, a decent pay rise and protecting working conditions,"" RMT General Secretary Mick Lynch said.The union said a resolution to the dispute is now further away. The RDG has urged passengers to plan journeys in advance and only travel by train if necessary during the strikes.Simultaneously, more than 10,000 ambulance workers have also decided to go on strike across England and Wales later this month.""Demoralised and downtrodden, they've faced twelve years of Conservative cuts to the service and their pay packets, fought on the frontline of a global pandemic and now face the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation,"" Rachel Harrison, national secretary at the GMB union, said.Photo taken on Aug. 19, 2022 shows an entrance of Paddington tube station closed due to a strike in London, Britain.

More than a quarter of those businesses said they were unable to obtain necessary goods for their business.The walkouts have taken a huge economic toll and have had a huge impact on day-to-day life. Economists have assessed that the first wave of rail strikes alone, in June 2022, cost the UK economy nearly 100 million British pounds (122 million U.S. dollars), according to a government report.The rail strikes impacting the Christmas weekend ""will be hugely damaging for hospitality businesses, their workers and their customers as it seems almost guaranteed that we will be facing a heavily disrupted Christmas for the third year in a row,"" UKHospitality Chief Executive Kate Nicholls commented.Nicholls estimated that the cost of these strikes already stood at 1.5 billion pounds in lost sales.

Nation can help cool soaring global inflation - People's Daily Online,"Nation can help cool soaring global inflationBy OUYANG SHIJIA (China Daily) 08:15, February 03, 2023An Indian customer shops at a toy store on Thursday at Yiwu International Trade City in Yiwu, Zhejiang province. The complex, the world´s biggest small-commodities market, reopened after closing for the Spring Festival holiday in late January. HUANG ZONGZHI/XINHUAStable prices provide room for more policy easing to shore up economyChina, with its benign inflation rate, is capable of playing a pivotal role in helping cool soaring global inflation and will continue to ensure strong economic recovery and mild price fluctuations this year, analysts and executives said.In marked contrast to major advanced economies, which have been plagued by surging inflation amid rising energy and food prices, China has seen its inflation levels remain low and stable, which, analysts said, provides space for further policy easing to shore up the world´s second-largest economy.""Over the past year, many advanced economies witnessed the biggest surge in inflation in 40 years,"" said Liu Zhicheng, director of commodity market division at the Academy of Macroeconomic Research´s market and price research institute. The academy is affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, China´s top economic regulatory body.Last year, a number of developed economies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, experienced inflationary whiplash. During the first 11 months of 2022, the inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, was 8 percent in the United States, 8.4 percent in the eurozone and 8.9 percent in the UK, sparking public complaints and protests. Some developing countries have also suffered from high inflation.Both the Bank of England, Britain´s central bank, and the European Central Bank were expected to raise interest rates on Thursday to tame high inflation, ease the cost-of-living crisis and avoid falling into recession. The US Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday.China has had a good record of keeping its overall price levels low and stable. Last year, the country´s consumer price index rose by 2 percent year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, which was well below the country´s inflation control target of around 3 percent.Notably, China´s food inflation rate was 2.8 percent and the cost of water, electricity and fuel rose a modest 3 percent in 2022, both significantly lower than in major Western economies, Liu said.He attributed soaring inflation across the globe to runaway energy and food prices amid geopolitical tensions and the massive fiscal and monetary easing measures in many Western countries.China has managed to deal with imported inflationary pressures with effective measures focused on stabilizing prices of products essential for people´s livelihood as well as bulk commodities.""China´s stable price levels are creating an environment that keeps economic performance stable, which also helps tame global inflation,"" Liu said.While warning of headwinds from imported inflationary pressures and potential fluctuations in commodity prices, Wan Jinsong, director of the NDRC´s Department of Price, said China has solid foundations as well as the confidence and capabilities to maintain overall price stability in 2023.Wan said at a recent news conference that the country has sufficient supplies of goods essential for people´s livelihood, a stable energy supply and an improved system for ensuring price and supply stability.""Compared with the dramatic inflation surges much of the world has experienced, China has continued to have low inflation due to weak domestic demand and government measures to stabilize prices and supplies,"" said Zhou Maohua, an analyst at China Everbright Bank.NBS data showed China´s CPI grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year in December, while the inflation rate in the US was 6.5 percent in the same month.Zhou estimated that China´s CPI will remain at a moderate level this year given the gradual pickup in demand and the country´s sufficient supply of daily necessities.""Unlike many other economies, China has not adopted massive policy stimulus over the past few years,"" he said. ""Given its stable inflation levels, the country has ample room and plenty of policy tools in reserves to support the economy.""Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said that his team thinks inflation is not a major concern for China in 2023, and they expect the policy stance to remain accommodative.A top government think tank forecast that China´s consumer inflation will stay mild in 2023, while cautioning that the risk of price increases beyond expectations still remains.The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Center for Forecasting Science estimates that China´s CPI will rise about 1.8 percent in 2023, while the producer price index will decline by about 0.4 percent.Gao Ruidong, chief macroeconomist at Everbright Securities, warned that the robust recovery in consumption of services may add to ""structural inflation pressures"".China is taking a more pro-growth stance, giving priority to expanding domestic demand and spurring consumption. The local governments have mapped out detailed plans in an attempt to put growth back onto the fast track.On Tuesday, the Beijing Municipal Government released a document on key tasks for 2023, urging more efforts to boost consumption, including spurring consumption in housing, new energy vehicles and elder care.There have been initial signs of recovery in consumption thanks to such policies in other provincial-level regions.In Guangdong province, Guangzhou´s Beijing Road shopping area achieved a business turnover of 345 million yuan ($51.3 million) in the weeklong Spring Festival holiday, up 19.4 percent year-on-year, official data showed.Gao said in an article published in China Finance magazine that the country will also likely see a notable rebound in consumption of services, such as transportation, catering, accommodation and entertainment, and prices for services will go up in the post-COVID period.He said the government should take more steps to keep prices stable, with a key focus on ensuring the supply of food and energy, assisting companies to stabilize employment and promoting the rebound of services industry.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0203/c90000-10202729.html,3,2,2023,"['china', 'inflation', 'price', 'prices', 'stable', 'country', 'consumption', 'policy', 'rate', 'economies', 'energy', 'food', 'levels', 'bank', 'supply', 'government', 'services', 'soaring', 'global', 'market']",0.41803957946815096

Scientists say Sunak's decision on testing travelers from China purely political move: The Guardian - People's Daily Online,"Scientists say Sunak´s decision on testing travelers from China purely political move: The Guardian (Xinhua) 09:15, January 03, 2023LONDON, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have dismissed British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak´s decision to impose COVID-19 tests on travelers from China, calling it ""a purely political manoeuvre,"" British newspaper The Guardian has reported.Scientists said testing travelers from China will ""make no difference to the rise or fall"" of the number of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom (UK), according to the report published on Saturday.UK´s chief medical officer Chris Whitty on Thursday briefed the health secretary Steve Barclay, saying that no clear evidence of significant benefits was shown from testing travelers from China, said the report.Quoting another news outlet, the Observer, the report said Barclay had discussed the issues with Sunak but the Prime Minister ""decided that it was more important for Britain to align itself with those nations -- the U.S., Japan, Italy and Spain -- that had already imposed such tests.""""I don't think it´s likely the UK will get any public health benefit from this measure,"" said Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University in the report. ""This can only have been done for political reasons.""Woolhouse added that another reason for testing was to track new COVID-19 variants, but no one in the UK seemed worried about the new variant XBB.1.5, which now accounts for about 40 percent of cases and is spreading rapidly in the U.S..""Instead, a lot of noise is being made about hypothetical variants emerging in China,"" said Woolhouse.Professor Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia also told the newspaper: ""Point-of-entry and point-of-exit screening for serious infections have been shown -- on many occasions -- to be ineffective at controlling diseases.""""This isn't going to protect the UK population because it isn't going to stop the spread.

This year we are particularly careful about all of these,"" Sedjkin, a United Kingdom (UK) resident, told Xinhua.Diego Gonzalez lives in Ireland. His family usually leaves the lights on through Christmas night in front of their house, but this year will be different. ""Now we enjoy the lights for two or three hours maximum because electricity is quite expensive,"" he said.People visit a shop on Ermou street in Athens, Greece, on Dec. 14, 2022. (Xinhua/Marios Lolos)Inflation has been high in Europe throughout the year and is still in double digits. In the eurozone, it reached 10 percent in November, and the UK´s consumer price index (CPI) rose by 10.7 percent in the same month, both well above the official target of 2 percent.High prices in most traditional goods segments, five successive quarters of real income decline, and depressed consumer confidence all suggest that Christmas sales will be disappointing in the eurozone, commented Tomas Dvorak, a senior economist at the economic advisory firm Oxford Economics.""Given the downbeat sentiment and the cost-of-living crisis, we doubt consumers will spend much of their remaining excess savings on discretionary items,"" he said.Across Europe, consumer sentiment remains mooted.

"Culture, jobs lure graduates back to China - People's Daily Online","Culture, jobs lure graduates back to ChinaBy Cheng Si (China Daily) 13:40, February 15, 2023People look for jobs at a career fair in Huai'an, Jiangsu province, on Jan 14, 2023. More than 2,000 vacancies involving accounting, marketing and logistics were offered by local firms. (ZHANG ZHAOJIU/FOR CHINA DAILY)Returning students favor lifestyle at home, upbeat on economy, survey saysChinese students who have graduated overseas have shown a greater willingness to return and work in the Chinese mainland because of more convenient living circumstances and identification with the culture, according to a new report. The optimization of COVID-19 control policies has also improved the prospects of a promising career at home, said the report by recruitment portal Zhaopin.The number of Chinese students who have graduated overseas wanting to land jobs in China saw a continuous increase from the start of the epidemic in early 2020, and reached a high in 2022.In 2021, about 1.05 million of these graduates returned to the mainland for work, almost a twofold rise from 2020 when 580,300 returned to seek employment, according to the Ministry of Education.Zhaopin conducted a survey of graduates who had returned, and found about 58 percent decided to come back to China because they preferred the convenient living environment, while 40 percent said it was because they identified with the culture.Also, the optimized COVID-19 control policies have given Chinese students graduating overseas greater confidence in the nation´s economic development in the near future, and strengthened their belief there are more job opportunities on the mainland.There has been greater demand for overseas graduate returnees after the nation optimized the COVID control policies. From Jan 30 to Feb 3, the first week after the Spring Festival holiday, Zhaopin vacancies that prioritized overseas returnees increased by 11 percent from the previous week.The vacancies gave priority to overseas returnees in sectors such as education, consultancy services and e-commerce, according to Zhaopin.Increases in recruitment salaries are also playing a big role in attracting overseas returnees. Vacancies prioritizing overseas returnees offered an average recruitment salary of 14,680 yuan ($2,151) per month in 2022, a 7 percent rise from the previous year, the report said.""I'm considering going back to China for work, mostly because I am more optimistic about China´s economy in the next three or five years,"" said Li Ying, a 25-year-old postgraduate student in the United Kingdom. ""And the culture and interpersonal relationships are also important elements. I get nostalgic sometimes, although I have friends here.""Li said that she has plans for a teaching career or working in a job with flexible hours.She said she might take a gap year and do flexible jobs and find the sector she is really interested in. ""I haven't decided about my future career yet, but I will go back to China for a job for sure.""To attract more Chinese graduates from overseas, governments at all levels have made efforts to introduce supportive policies in recent years.Hongkou district in Shanghai, for example, launched a housing policy for overseas graduate returnees in 2021. Under the policy, returning Chinese students can enjoy a six-month rental allowance within two years of gaining an overseas postgraduate degree.

London, a leading foreign exchange market, has also actively adopted the internationalization of the renminbi, he added.Stressing the importance of green development, McLean said that ""green is the new driver"" of UK-China financial cooperation.

The struggle to elect a new speaker shows the bitter divisions in U.S. politics - People's Daily Online,"The struggle to elect a new speaker shows the bitter divisions in U.S. politicsBy Tom Fowdy (China.org.cn) 09:31, January 12, 2023U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy (C) is seen in the House chamber as the House meets to elect a speaker in Washington, D.C., the United States, on Jan. 6, 2023. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)Kevin McCarthy was recently elected as the new speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The passing of the baton comes with the exit of Nancy Pelosi, who left her position following Republicans taking control of the House in the November 2022 mid-term elections. While one might have assumed the election of McCarthy was a formality, it proved to be anything but. The party´s narrow majority, combined with bitter internal politics, saw McCarthy lose 14 bids to be elected as the speaker due to a cohort of rebel legislators, led by Trump loyalist Matt Gaetz, who sought to impose several political conditionalities for his support, resulting in the group blocking his election again and again. Eventually, on the 15th try, McCarthy was elected to the post.Never since the American Civil War, in the mid-19th century, had the election of a U.S. House speaker been so contentious. Although he prevailed, as Reuters notes, it comes at a ""cost,"" one which involved ""making extensive concessions to right-wing hardliners that raised questions about the party´s ability to govern."" This speaks volumes about the current polarization of American politics, not least in the Republican Party, wherein the legacy of the former president has caused large-scale division both across the spectrum and within his own party, which has increasingly eroded the political center ground.The Republican Party has been in a civil war of sorts, wherein moderate or ""NeoConservative""-leaning Republicans have found themselves at odds with the ""Trump"" or ""MAGA"" faction, which espouses economic protectionism and hard-line nationalism. The former looks at the latter as being morally flawed and repulsive, while the latter sees the former as part of a corrupt establishment who do not vouch for the interests of ordinary people. This has led to a continual battle for influence in internal Republican party elections, such as primaries and nominations for various positions. When the GOP performed less well than expected in the 2022 mid-terms, including having lost the senate to the Democrats, the reaction of many was to blame the Trump faction for its perceived malign influence.But that hasn't settled the argument. On at least winning the House of Representatives, the Trumpian loyalists sought to undermine any attempt for a so-called moderate Republican in Kevin McCarthy to become Speaker of the House, taking no hesitation to undermine their own party in the first place. In doing so, this small faction of rebels is utilizing a tactic famously used in legislatures when the leading party only has a small majority, leveraging their numbers to strong-arm the ruling majority into taking on board their own political demands.This makes the ruling majority ""conditional,"" a phenomenon that has regularly been seen in the United Kingdom. For example, when the Conservative Party had a small ruling majority in the 1990s and from 2016-2019, pro-Brexit rebels repeatedly undermined the government. This effect is amplified when the political climate of a given country is polarized, and thus the ""fringe"" rebels have more backing in areas of public opinion to be able to politically gain from undermining the status quo. This reflects the current state of American democracy, which is increasingly contentious, bitter, and divided.The result is that Kevin McCarthy has been elected as a vastly weakened speaker. The Trumpian rebels will be able to force their demands and agenda onto various bills and items more successfully, which will have a destabilizing effect on American politics. This spells trouble for the Biden administration, who, while having gained the senate, will almost certainly find himself in contention with the House and a speaker who is forced to cater more to the party´s right wing. This will also spell further disruption to U.S.-China relations, as Trump-supporting representatives will be able to push anti-China items and influence the foreign policy of the U.S. in negative ways, irrespective of what the administration wants.The phenomenon of ""congressional gridlock,"" whereby the relationship between the executive and the legislature is defined by endless confrontation and frustration, is not a new thing in America, with every preceding president having faced it. However, a key is that in the increasingly divided and polarized environment of U.S. politics, this trend is only going to get worse and have more adverse effects. One simply has to look back at how Nancy Pelosi´s House of Representatives imposed the largest government shutdown ever in a conflict with the Trump administration over funding for his ""wall"" in 2018-2019. Keeping these previous events in mind, it looks as if American politics will face further bumpy roads ahead.Tom Fowdy is a British political and international relations analyst and a graduate of Durham and Oxford universities.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0112/c90000-10194977.html,12,1,2023,"['party', 'house', 'speaker', 'mccarthy', 'majority', 'politics', 'trump', 'political', 'american', 'kevin', 'elected', 'representatives', 'republican', 'rebels', 'bitter', 'china', 'united', 'taking', 'mid', 'election']",0.3937103616080888
Mideast tourism market gears up to welcome back Chinese tourists - People's Daily Online,"Mideast tourism market gears up to welcome back Chinese tourists (Xinhua) 13:44, January 09, 2023TUNIS/CAIRO, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- China´s move to downgrade the management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B starting from Sunday has excited governmental officials and tourism industry players in the Middle East, who are gearing up to welcome back Chinese tourists absent for three years due to the pandemic.LONG-AWAITED RETURN OF CHINESE TOURISTSChina has continuously optimized its COVID-19 responses, the latest of which will be lifting restrictions on citizens' outbound trips as of Sunday. The move is warmly welcomed by tourism practitioners in the Middle East.""We are so happy to hear the good news,"" Amir Ben Aribia, general manager of the Tunisian travel company Tunisia Blue Sky, told Xinhua.With Chinese tourists accounting for 90 percent of the company´s business before the pandemic outbreak, Ben Aribia has been closely following the adjustment of China´s COVID-related policies.Karim Mohammed, a souvenir shop owner in the famous Khan El Khalili bazaar in Egypt´s capital of Cairo, said that he expected Chinese tourists to return to Egypt soon.As the Belt and Road cooperation runs through the Middle East region where more countries offer visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry to Chinese citizens, the number of Chinese arrivals has surged in the pre-pandemic years.In 2016, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) started to grant visas to Chinese visitors upon arrival. In 2017, over 764,000 Chinese tourists visited the UAE, representing a 41-percent increase year on year.According to the 2020 report of Dubai Tourism, the easing of the UAE visa rules in 2016 led to the doubling of the number of Chinese visitors to the Gulf country in four years.When Saudi Arabia announced the issuance of tourist visas to visitors from 49 countries in 2019, China topped the number of tourist visas issued by the kingdom.Chinese tourists used to come in groups, which helped boost his business significantly, Mohammed said.Halis Aydogan, an official of the Turkish company Pasha Balloon Tours, told Xinhua that in Cappadocia, famous for its hot air balloon tours, Chinese tourists accounted for nearly half of some 600,000 balloon trip takers in 2019.HUGE POTENTIAL FOR MIDDLE EASTDespite the rapid growth, China remains a tourism market with huge potential for the Middle East. Experts believe the return of Chinese tourists would have a positive impact on a wide range of sectors in the region.""Not only does a hotel stay benefit the hospitality industry, but visitor spending in retail and leisure activities boosts demand for employment and stimulates the wider economy,"" Ross Curran, an assistant professor at Edinburgh Business School at Heriot-Watt University Dubai, told The National, an English daily newspaper with headquarters in Abu Dhabi.Meanwhile, the return of Chinese tourists would strengthen cultural exchanges between China and the Mideast countries in the long run.Chinese tourists show more interest in the historical sites and natural landscapes, Ben Aribia said, adding that the Chinese travel style brings the industry a stable and handsome income.That is why Tunisia Blue Sky has focused on the Chinese market in recent years, he said.Abedulrazzak Abo Mohaisen, a Jordanian who owns a workshop selling his handcrafted traditional Arabic daggers near the historical Roman Theater of Amman, said he expected a prosperous season brought by the return of Chinese visitors.""I believe that good numbers of Chinese tourists will revive tourism in Jordan. China is a major country with an ancient civilization, and cooperation with it in this sector will be very promising,"" he said.Saudi Arabia´s Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said that he hopes more Chinese tourists would visit and learn about Saudi heritage, culture, and people.""China is one of Saudi Arabia´s main trade partners, and we have been enjoying Chinese culture and heritage for many years, especially the delicious food that can be found everywhere in Saudi Arabia. Now, we want the Chinese to come,"" the minister told Xinhua before the 116th World Tourism Organization Executive Council Meeting in Jeddah.PREPARATIONS FOR NEW TOURIST WAVEWith restrictions on Chinese citizens' outbound trips lifted, a surge in numbers in 2023 is expected. Analysts noted that the travel industry needs to remain flexible to respond to changing conditions.International tourism arrivals, up 60 percent in 2022, will rise by a further 30 percent in 2023, with Chinese tourists acting as a great impetus to the growth, according to the London-based Economist.For now, hoteliers and travel agents in the Middle East are making preparations for a new wave of Chinese tourists.""We sit and work with our friends ... to plan on receiving Chinese visitors and organizing new tours and destinations in the city,"" Serhan Kochan, a tour operator for the Ligarba Travel Agency in the largest Turkish city of Istanbul, told Xinhua.He said his teams are creating unique excursion tours to cover some newly restored or opened tourist destinations along the coast of the sea.Irfan Karsli, head of the Ligarba Travel Agency, said Chinese tour groups are expected to start visiting Türkiye in April and the arrivals of large numbers of Chinese tourists would help boost the country´s ailing economy.Elhamy Al-Zayyat, a tourism expert and former head of the Egyptian Tourism Federation, said that Egypt targets a 30-percent rise in tourists per year after China lifts overseas travel restrictions, but promotional campaigns alone are not enough.""We need interesting services and innovative measures so as to lure Chinese tourists and challenge other competing markets,"" he said.Al-Zayyat also hoped that Egypt would cooperate with Chinese travel agencies to attract more Chinese tourists by providing interesting projects.""Chinese tourists will be impressed when they return to Egypt, because Khan al-Khalili has undergone a comprehensive development process that increased its beauty while preserving the Islamic heritage nature of the place,"" said Mohammed Saleh, an owner of a traditional Egyptian food restaurant in the bazaar.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0109/c90000-10193495.html,9,1,2023,"['tourists', 'tourism', 'china', 'travel', 'middle', 'return', 'east', 'years', 'egypt', 'visitors', 'saudi', 'industry', 'expected', 'arabia', 'tourist', 'tours', 'al', 'market', 'covid', 'pandemic']",0.3478038470962998

""It shows that the emphasis China gives to that means that modernization does not discard the past; it adopts the past and carries the past forward.""""Modernization is congruent with the culture of China itself,"" Albrow said.The Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development, he said.Albrow explained that modernization means applying science and technology to human organizations.""On the back of the development of modern technologies, modernization allows countries to take their own culture forward,"" he said. ""Every country is able to develop modernity in the way that suits its own culture.""""China has given an example to the world of how you can have a culturally-led modernization program,"" he added.Albrow, author of the book China and the Shared Human Future: Exploring Common Values and Goals, said that as the world turns its attention to the ongoing ""two sessions"" held in Beijing, it´s important for China to demonstrate that ""democracy comes in many different forms"" and that ""China is moving forward all the time.""The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual meetings of the National People´s Congress, the country´s national legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.""The Chinese version of democracy is one which enlists the support of the whole population, through the efforts of the Communist Party of China to produce a coherent approach to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""China´s form of democracy is an evolving form of discussion and debate, but one which is built upon the consensus of society as a whole.""""It´s a profound kind of democracy and very different from the kinds which exist in so many Western countries, the kinds of democracies that exist, for instance, (in) the United Kingdom or the United States, ones which tend to produce disagreements"" and make it difficult for a country to take any single path into the future, despite its continual debate and discussion about how to go forward, according to Albrow.""Democracy is not a stable condition; democracy is something which is continually moving forward,"" he continued, adding that ""China is in a position now, in this particular 'two sessions', to take us forward again, with well-judged reforms of its own system.""Albrow is confident in the CPC´s resolve to further reforms that will remove institutional obstacles to fulfill Chinese modernization.

Simply put, their choice is between heat or eat.Many in the country had already been in a rather tight financial position before the cold weather set in, Dr. Keith Baker said.Last week was a particularly cold one across the UK, with snow, ice and fog warnings in several places. Dec. 12 was the coldest day in the UK since December 2010, the Met Office said.As a scholar, Baker has worked with groups seeking to help people faced with the dual problem of a cost-of-living crisis and high energy bills. ""People really are on the line between just and only just about surviving and being pushed into really quite deplorable situations.""Inflation has been running high in the UK since last winter, reaching successive new records. In November, the UK´s consumer price index (CPI) rose by 10.7 percent. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increased by 16.5 percent in that month.""We don't know how high some food prices are going to rise. Barely a day goes by before you see that the price of one type of food is going up, next day the price of another type of food is going up,"" Baker said, adding that this level of uncertainty is detrimental to mental health.Inflation is being driven mainly by soaring energy prices. In October, UK households paid 88.9 percent more on average for electricity, gas and other fuels than a year ago, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Domestic gas prices in October were more than double that a year earlier.People have suffered substantially with their bills going up, Baker said. ""Energy bills will go up to about 2,600 British pounds (3,146 U.S. dollars) on average, and I stress that´s average, rising again to 3,000 pounds as of April.""""We've now got to the point where charities are trying to get out warm clothing to people.""Public libraries and community centers across the UK have thrown open their doors to people eager to escape the cold in their homes, offering warm drinks and hot soup.Acknowledging that the government support offered by newly installed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt may go some way to help families on welfare benefits, Baker has called for more.""A lot of households are already in the position of no heat and less to eat, and I really wish politicians would get it through their heads that some householders are really in a dire situation.""

US-led West's pandemic trick won't succeed - People's Daily Online,"US-led West´s pandemic trick won't succeedBy Mahesh Pathak (China Daily) 10:44, January 19, 2023Luo Jie | China DailyRight from the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been stigmatized by some Western countries, especially the United States, with many people of Chinese origin becoming the target of hate crimes.Hate-mongers in some Western countries, the US in particular, used the pandemic as an excuse to target people of Asian, especially Chinese, origin. They blamed people of Asian origin for the spread of the novel coronavirus. Worse, previous US president Donald Trump played a key role in increasing racist attacks by labeling the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"".""People first"" has remained at the core of China´s COVID-19 response over the past three years, during which the virus mutated many times and the pandemic situation got from bad to worse before improving. Yet the worsening pandemic situation also spurred different governments and pharmaceutical companies to invest more resources and use more scientific minds to develop vaccines and prescribe the treatment for COVID-19 patients. As for China, the pandemic not only prompted it to develop COVID-19 vaccines but also provide free vaccination for all Chinese citizens.But with China lifting almost all anti-pandemic restrictions on Jan 8, some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, reintroduced compulsory pre-flight COVID-19 tests for Chinese visitors, while countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Italy, now require Chinese visitors to undergo COVID-19 tests on arrival and quarantine if they test positive.The World Health Organization has said that it is very concerned about reports of rising number of severe cases in China after the country abandoned the dynamic clearing COVID-19 policy.Most countries have not announced new entry requirements for Chinese visitors, and a select few have ruled them out entirely, including Poland and Bulgaria which refused to toe the European Union´s line on entry requirements for Chinese visitors.The US has made it mandatory for Chinese visitors to take an RT-PCR test less than 48 hours before boarding a flight and test negative to gain entry into the country from Jan 5. China fully opened its borders from Jan 8, welcoming visitors without mandatory quarantine and allowing Chinese citizens to travel abroad.At the Hong Kong airport, hundreds of people were recently seen waiting to check in for flights to cities on the Chinese mainland, but the arrivals hall was relatively quiet. Many of Hong Kong´s border checkpoints were fully opened, as were transportation halls and shuttered storefronts.Given the present situation, therefore, China may first normalize economic ties with some countries, including Belt and Road countries, before it does so with Western nations to establish a channel for the normal movement of people and goods.The Global North is also trying to reduce China´s expanding global presence in the fields of infrastructure and technology. For example, the G7 Summit in June 2022 launched a $600 billion fund to mobilize investment in global infrastructure projects as an answer to the Belt and Road Initiative. But the G7´s endeavor is a decade too late and short of billions of dollars, because the China-proposed initiative was launched in 2013 and completed or is working on projects worth more than $4 trillion.There are also presentation problems. The industrialized countries claim they are banding together to defend universal values, underpinning a liberal world order. But China and Russia argue that the industrialized countries are trying to rebuild a hierarchy based on imperialism and white supremacy. Opinion polls in the Global South show the arguments of Russia and China have found a receptive audience. Even within the Global North, many countries believe unilateral US actions are alienating some of their business partners. In fact, the US' restrictions on technology exports to China will deal another big blow to the biggest tech enterprises in the ROK, Japan and the EU.The Global North is also worried that China might end up controlling the technologies of the future and building what one senior US official said was ""a terrifying surveillance autocracy"" with a worldwide reach.To be sure, the pandemic has intensified the competition between China and the US, and the US has been badmouthing and stigmatizing China in the hope that it will help it emerge victorious in the competition. But that might not happen.The author is an independent expert in international relations based in Nepal.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0119/c90000-10198105.html,19,1,2023,"['china', 'countries', 'pandemic', 'covid', 'visitors', 'global', 'western', 'united', 'origin', 'situation', 'jan', 'including', 'entry', 'north', 'states', 'target', 'hate', 'asian', 'coronavirus', 'worse']",0.287411274911275
Chinese rescuers rush to find more quake survivors - People's Daily Online,"Chinese rescuers rush to find more quake survivors (China Daily) 08:26, February 13, 2023(Photo courtesy of China’s Ministry of Emergency Management)China´s official and civilian rescue teams worked against the clock over the weekend to find survivors trapped under rubble, following the Feb 6 earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria.By Sunday, the official rescue team from the Chinese mainland had saved five people and located eight bodies while surveying 49 collapsed buildings in Antakya, one of the worst-hit cities in Turkiye´s southern Hatay province.In a three-hour rescue operation on Friday, a woman was pulled to safety from ruins by the official team, more than 100 hours after the first quake, a magnitude 7.8 temblor, hit. About nine hours later, a second, magnitude 7.5, quake struck the region.The team was called to the site after their Turkish counterparts discovered signs of life while clearing a pile of rubble. During the operation, the Chinese rescuers squeezed a flexible endoscope camera through small gaps in the debris to survey the conditions beneath. They also worked with Turkish rescuers to break up the surface of rubble to gain access to the woman and extract her safely.On Saturday evening, with technical support from the Chinese team, Turkish rescuers successfully saved a man during a joint search mission in Antakya where survivors were found the previous day.The 82-member official Chinese team has been working closely with its international counterparts from Italy, the United Kingdom, Serbia, Slovakia and Oman, ensuring that search and rescue missions are well coordinated.Meanwhile, a 59-member team sent by the Hong Kong government pulled three survivors from six-meter-deep rubble in Hatay on Saturday.Yiu Men-yeung, head of the HK team, said that it was exciting to find the survivors six days after the earthquake. Rescuers will do their best to search for more people and won't give up hope, Yiu added.China´s civilian rescue teams also continued to search for survivors over the weekend. As of Friday morning, 15 civilian Chinese rescue teams, comprising 288 members, had made it to quake-hit regions in Turkiye.On Saturday, the Rescue Team of Ramunion helped locate seven people trapped in an apartment building in Iskenderun, Hatay, after 10 hours of searching. Unfortunately, they were all dead, the team´s command center said.The Ramunion team has been involved in search and rescue missions in four cities in Hatay since arriving in Turkiye on Wednesday. By Saturday night, the team had found seven survivors.Meanwhile, China also delivered on Saturday morning its first earthquake relief supplies to Turkiye, including tents and medical equipment, according to the China International Development Cooperation Agency.The death toll in Turkiye and Syria surpassed 33,000 on Sunday, AP reported.Zhao Mi, a Chinese national who has lived in Antakya since 2019, survived the earthquake. While receiving treatment at a hospital, she recalled the terrifying moment the quake struck early in the morning.She and her children were sleeping in separate bedrooms when the 15-story apartment building they had been living in collapsed on Monday, Chinese media reported on Saturday.""The building first started to shake violently. When it collapsed, I immediately curled up my body. I was buried in darkness and couldn't move,"" the 32-year-old said.She could hear her daughter, 9, and son, 13, calling for help and they were soon rescued from the rubble.Zhao was pulled from the ruins about 25 hours after the building collapsed. ""I used toilet tissue to soak up rainwater dripping down from the rubble and then squeezed the water into my mouth to survive. The water also kept me alert so I could call for help,"" she said.Zhao was being treated for multiple fractures in a hospital. Her daughter was in the intensive care unit of another hospital for multiple fractures and injuries to her organs.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0213/c90000-10206582.html,13,2,2023,"['team', 'rescue', 'survivors', 'china', 'rubble', 'turkiye', 'saturday', 'rescuers', 'quake', 'search', 'collapsed', 'hatay', 'hours', 'building', 'find', 'civilian', 'teams', 'antakya', 'hit', 'pulled']",0.23346560846560846

[Photo/Xinhua]Vice-Premier Liu He met with United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Zurich, Switzerland, on Wednesday, for talks that were seen as improving bilateral relations while finding ways for China and the US to work together on tackling global challenges.Both countries agreed to enhance communication on macroeconomic and financial issues, according to a joint statement released after the talks. The statement described the first face-to-face meeting between the two as ""substantive, candid and pragmatic"".The two sides also agreed to increase cooperation on green finance on a bilateral and a multilateral basis, such as within the frameworks of the United Nations, the G20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the statement said.Yellen was invited to visit China this year, and the two sides agreed that their economic and trade teams will maintain communication at all levels.The meeting was a follow-up to the one between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia, in November, during which both leaders pledged to increase communication.Christopher Bovis, a professor of international business law at the University of Hull in the United Kingdom, said, ""The significance of the meeting between the Chinese vice-premier and the US treasury secretary is not to be underestimated.""""Face-to-face communication, in diplomatic terms, usually indicates the gravitas of the situation amidst the big picture of international developments and the thematics of the 2023 Davos economic forum,"" he said.Bovis said he believes the talks set the agenda that not only will dominate the Davos proceedings, but also project the parameters of current and future cooperation between the US and China, the world´s two largest economies.In a speech on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum´s annual meeting in Davos, Liu urged world leaders to abandon the ""Cold War mentality"" and reaffirmed China´s commitment to international cooperation and all-around opening-up, adding that ""China´s door to the outside will only open wider"".",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0119/c90000-10197944.html,19,1,2023,"['china', 'united', 'davos', 'communication', 'face', 'meeting', 'cooperation', 'economic', 'liu', 'yellen', 'states', 'talks', 'agreed', 'statement', 'forum', 'international', 'substantive', 'candid', 'switzerland', 'washington']",0.3169753086419754
China a sunny spot amid global dark clouds - People's Daily Online,"China a sunny spot amid global dark cloudsBy Andrew K.P. Leung (China Daily) 16:19, January 13, 2023As 2023 begins, the world remains highly uncertain and fragile, with Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, saying she expects one-third of the world to be in recession.Energy and food inflationary repercussions because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict remain rampant. Cassandras are having a field day on China´s perceived doom and gloom, due to its decision to end the ""dynamic clearing"" pandemic prevention and control policy marked by increasing Omicron infections. Diplomatic rhetoric notwithstanding, there is no let up in the United States' anti-China semiconductor stranglehold, nor is there any easing of its no-holds-barred geopolitical encirclement.False perception of doom and gloomAs a matter of fact, Western media reports are full of images of stretched hospital wards, overflowing mortuaries and barren pharmacy shelves, a picture of panic and pandemonium.According to Nature, a prestigious science journal, 1 million people could die in China from the sudden surge in infections, barring re-imposition of preventive restrictions. Fears have arisen about the emergence of a new variant of the novel coronavirus or subvariants of the Omicron variant. China is sharing the latest data with the World Health Organization, and while welcoming Chinese tourists, many countries are requiring internationally-recognized non-infection proof before entry.So why do I think China is likely to be a comparatively sunny spot?First, much misunderstood and misrepresented, the strict prevention and control policy did not mandate zero cases in all circumstances. It was used as a strategy to ensure earliest possible detection, isolation, treatment and cure. As a result, it greatly minimized deaths and prevented contagion from province to province.According to Johns Hopkins University´s analysis updated on Dec 31, 2022, China´s COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 people stands at 1.2, compared with 331.65 for the US, 45.05 for Japan, and 38.46 for India.It´s very saddening that some senior citizens may die in the latest wave of infections, but it should be noted that there will be no significant change in China´s extremely low mortality rate compared with the overall international rate.In a way, China is a ""victim"" of its own success in shielding the vast majority of its population from the pandemic. As a consequence, ""herd immunity"" remains relatively low. While 90 percent of the population has received the first vaccination dose, only 76.6 percent of those aged 80 and above have got at least one dose, and only 40 percent have received a booster dose.Beijing is now scrambling to vaccinate up to 90 percent of those aged 80 or above by the end of January. It is also building a database of people living with chronic diseases to maximise the rate of successful outcomes.As the massive Chinese Lunar New Year migration starts (people returning home for Spring Festival family reunion), Beijing has asked prefecture and township officials to urgently fortify pandemic defenses, including better manning clinics, stocking medicines, medical equipment, and free ""medicine kits"", raising the public´s medical awareness, and using official information to counter rumours.As for some barren pharmacy shelves in some cities, they largely reflected public hysteria due to the sudden rise in infections among family members, friends and colleagues. There is a mad rush to stock up on fever medicines such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, prompting the authorities to take measures to increase the production of these two drugs by four times in a month to 202 million tablets and 190 million tablets respectively. But it should be noted that many cities have already withstood the infection peak and gradually returned to normal.With expert input, China, the same as other countries, has realized that the COVID-19 pandemic has become an endemic disease with a much lower mortality rate, albeit it is much more contagious now. In fact, most infected people get well after a week or so. As such, initial paranoia is slowly giving way to good-humoured acceptance of widespread but mild infections.Right time to pursue second centenary goalWith the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China already three months behind us, it´s time to recharge our batteries and make efforts to realize China´s centenary goal of becoming a modern socialist nation including achieving ""common prosperity"" by mid-century.Part and parcel of the trajectory is a surging middle-income group — expected to be 800 million strong by 2035 — a vast number of which came out in droves across China to celebrate the dawning of the New Year. With more than 400 million middle-income consumers at present, China is already the world´s second-largest consumer market. And since China is continuing to further open up while pivoting toward domestic consumption, it is set to become the world´s largest consumer market in the coming years.Many Chinese consumers are well-off enough to afford overseas travel, and the government has opened the borders to allow two-way flow of Chinese travellers, foreign visitors and university students.According to an August 2021 report by Georgetown University´s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology, Chinese universities are expected to produce more than 7.7 million STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates annually by 2025. That number will outstrip that of the US by more than three to one if international students are excluded. In this regard, China´s success in building its own Tiangong space station speaks volumes about its scientific and technological capabilities.Besides, despite US semiconductor restrictions, China is leapfrogging into next-generation photonic and quantum chips. Along with a head start in various aspects of 5G technology, big data and the internet of things, China is staying ahead of the game in harnessing the ""Fourth and Fifth Industrial Revolutions"". And given its ubiquitous digital economy aided by robotics and automation, aging demographics are not an insurmountable challenge for China.Pivotal position in global economyUS-led efforts at decoupling notwithstanding, China remains at the heart of the global supply and value chains, especially in the world´s largest trading bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which represents one-third of global GDP and a third of the world´s population. China´s pivotal position in the world economy is further entrenched with the massive Belt and Road Initiative, with railways, bridges, highways and ports linking up the region.Even when some Chinese cities were under lockdown in October last year, some media reports, using the IMF´s earlier estimate of only 4.4 percent growth, concluded that China would contribute 30 percent to global growth in 2023. Allowing for infection surges in the first quarter or so, the Economist Intelligence Unit has revised upward its forecast for China´s real GDP growth from 4.7 percent to 5.2 percent in 2023. This is in stark contrast to the IMF chief´s forecast of global recession.However, the next couple of months are likely to be crucial because China still needs to keep a close eye on the epidemic since it took new rules on Jan 8. With Beijing´s proven track record of massive mobilization of personnel and resources, the light of hope is right in front of us as President Xi said in his televised New Year speech.The author is an international and independent China strategist and is a former director-general of social welfare and Hong Kong´s official chief representative for the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Russia, Norway and Switzerland.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0113/c90000-10195875.html,13,1,2023,"['china', 'global', 'million', 'infections', 'rate', 'international', 'pandemic', 'remains', 'infection', 'university', 'mortality', 'population', 'dose', 'beijing', 'massive', 'cities', 'largest', 'technology', 'growth', 'sunny']",0.39142197646103905
Massive strikes to hit Britain during Christmas season - People's Daily Online,"Massive strikes to hit Britain during Christmas season (Xinhua) 10:13, December 17, 2022LONDON, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) faces weeks of massive strikes during the Christmas season by transport and postal workers, nurses, and border guards.A wave of industrial action began on Tuesday, with more than 40,000 members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) walking out for 48 hours. Three more weeks of disruption are set to follow.Britain´s National Railway said due to various industrial actions, there will be a reduced train service until Jan. 8, 2023, with ""significant disruption expected across the rail network.""The Communication Workers Union (CWU) also said there would be strikes on Dec. 23 and Dec. 24, some of the busiest days for pre-Christmas deliveries.Meanwhile, the Public and Commercial Service (PCS) union has announced that Civil Service industrial action in late December will impact Border Force services. Travelers who are planning to enter the UK during the proposed strike period may face longer waiting times at border controls.Nurses have also joined the list of striking workers.""Up to 100,000 nursing staff are taking part in strikes in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, and a further day of strike action is planned for Dec. 20,"" said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).Gemma Dean, a human resources expert and lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University´s business school told Xinhua in an interview: ""The industrial situation we're seeing at the moment, with a significant increase in strikes, has been something we haven't seen in the UK for a little while.""What we're seeing right now are groups of workers going on strike or taking forms of industrial action that typically haven't done so. For example, ambulance drivers and nurses. Some of these groups have never gone on strike, so it is surprising to see that, but it may be reflective of the depth of feeling that employees have now about their pay and their terms and conditions of employment,"" said Dean.The current high inflation rate in the UK and cost-of-living increases have put a lot of pressure on people, said Madeleine Stevens, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University.""After working through the pandemic the morale was an all-time high at one point, and then it was an all-time low,"" a nurse told Xinhua.""And now is the time to give the nurses what they and the rest of Britain´s National Health Service (NHS) deserve. After everything they've done, they work back-to-back shifts, no days off, for very little pay,"" the nurse said.Stevens told Xinhua: ""I think the wave of industrial action we see now is not only a roller coaster effect from the rail strikes and the Royal Mail, and then it´s kind of growing in momentum, but also with Christmas time coming people are feeling pressure and worries. It´s driven by fear, which is very unpleasant.""There could even be further consequences than the strikes, Stevens said. ""It could be more than just the public service sector that´s struggling with pay awards and the cost of living. It impacts every single one of us. So there is a risk, if the demand for pay goes up, that it will have further implications for the wider community,"" she said.""And perhaps a strategy to consider is to rather look at some of the causes that will benefit across the board, the nation across the board,"" Stevens suggested.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1217/c90000-10185233.html,17,12,2022,"['strikes', 'industrial', 'workers', 'action', 'service', 'christmas', 'nurses', 'strike', 'pay', 'stevens', 'britain', 'border', 'national', 'union', 'rail', 'massive', 'season', 'december', 'weeks', 'transport']",0.4848198198198198

Multinationals eye evolving Chinese market - People's Daily Online,"Multinationals eye evolving Chinese marketBy ZHONG NAN (China Daily) 09:55, January 06, 2023Visitors to a Shanghai trade fair are attracted by a cooker produced by Bosch. The German multinational engineering and technology group is building new plants in China. JIA TIANYONG/CHINA NEWS SERVICENation attracts companies with huge opportunities and opening-up measuresYann Bozec, a French citizen and president for the Asia-Pacific region at Tapestry Group, a luxury goods company based in the United States, has two new year wishes.He wants to add 100 stores across China by 2025 and deploy more resources to spur sales through digital channels and duty-free business at Hainan Free Trade Port in Hainan province.Bozec, who has lived in Shanghai for 15 years and manages sales for more than 360 stores owned by the group´s brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, said that as most Chinese customers are digitally connected, his company needs to adapt to changing trends in the country.""In addition to pushing business digitally, we plan to continue expanding our distribution, particularly in third- and fourth-tier cities, while looking for more opportunities in major city markets,"" said Bozec, who is also president and CEO of luxury design business Coach China.A long-term thriving market for numerous multinationals' global strategies, China has evolved from a large consumption market and low-cost manufacturing country to an important regional export base, an innovation center and a key part of the global supply chain.This transformation has been fueled by decades of growth, trade globalization and Chinese consumers' growing purchasing power.Wei Jianguo, vice-chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said that despite facing external uncertainties and disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China will remain attractive to multinationals this year, as its massive market and opening-up measures will boost business confidence despite globally subdued investment sentiment.""One of the key tasks for multinationals is to be clear about the positioning of the Chinese market in their global business map. For many of them, such as France´s L'Oreal Group and Germany´s BMW Group, China has become their second home market or even their largest global market,"" Wei said.Sang Baichuan, dean of the Institute of International Economy at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said many global companies have discovered that Chinese consumers and the business environment are constantly changing due to factors such as an industrial upgrading boom, changed business modes, and demand for personalized products.As a result, these companies have adopted localized business strategies and appointed more Chinese executives as heads of their branches in China, Sang said.In tandem with recognized brand awareness, sales channels and economy of scale, multinationals had a first-mover advantage after they entered China several decades ago. Although facing fierce competition from domestic rivals, they will remain competitive in this huge market as long as they adjust quickly, Sang added.Zhang Xiaoyu, president for China at Arkema, a French manufacturer of specialty materials, said, ""With China further optimizing its COVID-19 control policies and vowing to make greater efforts to maintain steady foreign investment growth, we remain confident and ready to contribute to the development of local industry.""Early last month, Bostik, a subsidiary of Arkema, announced a plan to increase its investment by 400 million yuan ($58 million) in new businesses and to develop new products in Shanghai.【1】【2】【3】【4】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0106/c90000-10192623.html,6,1,2023,"['china', 'business', 'market', 'multinationals', 'group', 'global', 'shanghai', 'trade', 'companies', 'bozec', 'president', 'sales', 'international', 'remain', 'investment', 'sang', 'huge', 'opportunities', 'opening', 'french']",0.3306632864852042

(Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa)Humans have paid a high price because of these extreme weather events, with lives lost to the natural disasters.LONDON, Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- From scorching sun and drying rivers to devastating floods, another year of extreme weather gripped Europe in 2022, warning about the impact of climate change and sending a cautionary note that more human efforts are needed for a greener future.""LIVE PICTURE OF A WARMING WORLD""When a cold snap gripped Northern Europe in mid-December and snow, a rare occurrence, blanketed London, memories of the extreme summer heat still lingered. In July, the United Kingdom (UK) recorded its highest ever temperature. Hungary this year also endured its hottest summer since 1901.Amid the scorching heatwaves, natural disasters ensued. A wildfire caused by a lightning strike in June became the worst ever recorded in Spain. Several parts of Italy also saw wildfires, including a massive one that burned over 850 hectares of land and forced more than 1,000 residents to evacuate.In late August, Europe was experiencing its worst drought in at least 500 years, with almost two-thirds of the continent in a state of alert or warning. Water levels of the river Drava in eastern Croatia dropped to a historic low.Photo taken on Aug. 31, 2022 shows a drought-affected farm field in Staffordshire, Britain. (Photo by Jon Super/Xinhua)Floods have posed another threat. A storm hit the northern Adriatic port of Rijeka in Croatia in September, with the downpour flooding the city center and damaging buildings. Intense rains early this month in Portugal also led to disturbances to road traffic and flooding at Lisbon Airport.With the higher frequency of extreme weather events came increasing concerns over climate change. Temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average over the past 30 years, the highest of any continent in the world, a report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) showed in early November.As a result, Alpine glaciers lost 30 meters in ice thickness from 1997 to 2021, and the Greenland ice sheet is melting and contributing to accelerating sea level rise, the report said.""Europe presents a live picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from impacts of extreme weather events,"" WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said.A car moves in flood water after heavy rain in Brod na Kupi, Croatia, Sept. 29, 2022. (Goran Kovacic/PIXSELL via Xinhua)HUGE LOSSESHumans have paid a high price because of these extreme weather events, with lives lost to the natural disasters. During the five heat periods this summer, the estimated excess mortality in England was 2,803 for those aged 65 and over, the highest since the introduction of a heatwave plan in 2004.In Spain, this summer was not only the hottest on record, but also the deadliest in 20 years, as thousands of people have died from heat-related causes on top of the high death toll associated with COVID-19.""Most at risk are the very young and the very old or those with a chronic illness that prevents them from hydrating themselves or those who are unable to avoid the heat,"" Emilio Salgado, senior specialist in the Emergency Department of Barcelona´s Hospital Clinic, told Xinhua.The deadliest extreme climate events in Europe are heatwaves, particularly in Western and Southern Europe, the WMO explained. ""The combination of climate change, urbanization and population ageing in the region creates, and will further exacerbate, vulnerability to heat,"" it said.A woman refreshes herself with the water from a fountain at Piazza del Popolo in Rome, Italy on Aug. 5, 2022. (Photo by Alberto Lingria/Xinhua)Pressure has been piling on the economy. Public transport was disrupted across the UK amid heatwaves. Severe droughts undermined supply chains on waterways in Germany. In France, wine production suffered in quantity and quality, while Italy saw agricultural production slashed.Climate-related events, including heatwaves, floods and storms, have caused over 145 billion euros (154.2 billion U.S. dollars) in economic losses in the European Union (EU) over the past decade, the bloc´s statistical office Eurostat said in late October.The highest total loss was recorded in 2017, reaching 27.9 billion euros, because of the heatwaves registered in Europe that dried the land and caused wildfires, Eurostat added.A thermometer shows 41 degrees Celsius in front of a building in Bucharest, capital of Romania, July 24, 2022. (Photo by Cristian Cristel/Xinhua)DOUBLE STANDARDSThe prolonged energy crisis has distracted Europe from its green goals, as many countries considered turning back to coal to secure energy supplies. Germany, Austria, Poland, the Netherlands and Greece were among the first to reopen coal power plants or take measures to support coal power.Europe´s thermal coal imports through November jumped by 36.2 percent from the same period in 2021 to roughly 83 million tonnes, a Reuters columnist quoted ship-tracking data from Kpler as saying in a December article.This summer, the European Parliament also voted in favor of plans to award a green investment label to nuclear and gas projects, sparking claims of ""greenwashing"" by some EU member states and environmental lobbyists.Photo taken on Sept. 10, 2022 shows a household gas stove in Haarlem, the Netherlands. (Photo by Sylvia Lederer/Xinhua)""European countries, which have been the chief beneficiaries of carbon pollution, are taking deliberate energy policy that clearly impinges on environmental protection aspirations. It is a demonstration of double standards,"" Kenya-based international relations scholar Cavince Adhere said.In early December, the UK government also approved the country´s first new coal mine in three decades, largely for steelmaking. Despite an official endorsement that the mine seeks to be net zero in its operations and contribute to local employment, criticism mounted over its lasting environmental impact.The coal mine will release some 250 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next 30 years, according to Myles Allen, professor of geosystem sciences at the University of Oxford.A train passes a thermal power plant in Berlin, Germany, Sept. 8, 2022. (Xinhua/Ren Pengfei)Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate change economics and policy at the University of Oxford, emphasized the difference between a short-term increase in fossil fuel use in response to the energy crisis, and new long-term investment in a coal mine.The decision to approve the mine sends a completely wrong message about the UK´s commitment to net zero, Fankhauser said. ""It looks hypocritical in the eyes of low-income countries, whose own fossil fuel ambitions we have repeatedly criticized.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1226/c90000-10188211.html,26,12,2022,"['europe', 'extreme', 'climate', 'events', 'coal', 'weather', 'change', 'summer', 'heat', 'heatwaves', 'mine', 'december', 'highest', 'years', 'energy', 'high', 'lost', 'natural', 'disasters', 'floods']",0.4517945233061511

Experts optimistic on overall price stability this year - People's Daily Online,"Experts optimistic on overall price stability this yearBy OUYANG SHIJIA (China Daily) 09:38, January 13, 2023Customers shop for Spring Festival decorations at a market in Taian, Shandong province, on Thursday. China´s consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, rose by 2 percent year-on-year in 2022, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. ZOU HONG/CHINA DAILYChina has favorable conditions and capabilities to maintain overall price stability in 2023 despite imported inflationary pressures and potential fluctuations in high international commodity prices, officials and experts said on Thursday.Compared with the soaring prices in major advanced economies, China´s inflation remains mild and controllable, leaving room for policy easing to bolster the economy amid headwinds and uncertainties, they said.China´s consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year in December, up from a 1.6 percent increase in November, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.Meanwhile, China´s producer price index, which gauges factory-gate prices, decreased by 0.7 percent year-on-year last month, after a 1.3 percent decline in November.Wan Jinsong, director of the National Development and Reform Commission´s Department of Price, said the country has solid foundations, as well as confidence and capabilities, to maintain overall price stability in 2023, given the sufficient supply of daily necessities, the stable supply of energy and an improved system for ensuring price and supply stability.Wan told a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that China´s overall price levels are generally stable as the country´s full-year consumer inflation rose by 2 percent year-on-year. In contrast, inflation in major advanced economies — the United States, the eurozone and the United Kingdom — as measured by CPI, was about 8 percent, above 8 percent and about 9 percent, respectively.""Unlike the rest of the world, China has continued to issue low inflation data due to weak domestic demand,"" said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, adding that the COVID-19 outbreaks severely curtailed economic activity in December, particularly in the services sector.Lu said his team expects CPI inflation to rise slightly to 2 percent year-on-year in January, mostly due to seasonal patterns, as the lunar New Year holiday takes place early this year compared with 2022.Meanwhile, PPI inflation will post a 0.5 percent year-on-year decline in January, mainly driven by the recent rise in some metal prices, he said.""Looking forward … we think inflation is not a major concern for China in 2023 and we expect the policy stance to remain accommodative,"" Lu said.A top government think tank forecast on Thursday that China´s consumer inflation will stay mild in 2023, cautioning that the risks of price increases beyond expectations still remain.The Center for Forecasting Science at the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates that China´s CPI will rise about 1.8 percent in 2023, while the PPI will decline by about 0.4 percent.Zhou Maohua, an analyst at China Everbright Bank, said the mild inflation levels will offer room for policymakers to intensify policy easing, and there is plenty of policy space to cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio — the proportion of money that lenders must hold as reserves — in the next few months.The latest data also offers the official snapshot of improved monetary conditions as China´s broad money supply, or M2, rose 11.8 percent year-on-year in December to 266.43 trillion yuan ($39.41 trillion), according to the People´s Bank of China, the country´s central bank.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0113/c90000-10195523.html,13,1,2023,"['china', 'inflation', 'price', 'thursday', 'stability', 'consumer', 'prices', 'policy', 'supply', 'january', 'index', 'rose', 'data', 'national', 'major', 'mild', 'december', 'decline', 'country', 'cpi']",0.34283085961657395
