China's newly-appointed Premier Li Qiang takes an oath during the National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 11, 2023.Greg Baker/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      China’s rubber-stamp legislature has appointed Li Qiang, a long-time aide of leader Xi Jinping, as premier, the man tasked with reviving the world’s second-largest economy after three years of zero-Covid restrictions.  The National People’s Congress endorsed Li in a largely ceremonial vote at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Saturday morning. Li got 2,936 votes, with three votes cast against him and eight abstained.  Li, 63, is one of the most trusted protégés of Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades. He will replace outgoing Premier Li Keqiang, who had been Xi’s second in command since 2013.  Traditionally, the premiership is an influential role in charge of the economy, although over the past decade, its power has been eroded by Xi, who has taken almost all decision-making into his own hands.  Even so, much of the new premier’s efforts are likely to be concentrated on trying to turn around the fortunes of the Chinese economy, which recently set a GDP growth target for this year of about 5% – the lowest in decades.

Ng Han Guan/APChina sets lowest GDP growth target in decades as Beijing tightens its beltThat will be no easy task: China is in the midst of a historic downturn for the all-important housing market, consumer spending is sluggish, and unemployment remains high among the youth. And local governments are saddled by debt.  Business confidence has plummeted following an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on the private sector and increased uncertainties about China’s future policy. Relations between the United States and China are at their lowest point in decades, leading to escalating tensions in technology and investment. Foreign investment in China has slumped.  Xi identified Li Qiang, a former Communist Party boss of Shanghai who presided over the city’s chaotic two-month lockdown, as the man to take on these challenges during a leadership reshuffle in October.  Born in the eastern province of Zhejiang, Li started his career as a worker at an irrigation pumping station. He received his undergraduate education in agricultural mechanization at a college in the city of Ningbo and then worked his way up through the provincial bureaucracy.  From left, Zhu Hexin, He Lifeng, Ding Xuexiang and Li Qiang.AP licensedMeet the 4 men tapped to run China's economy His career took off after he served as Xi’s de facto chief of staff when Xi was the party chief of Zhejiang province between 2002 and 2007.  Li is the first premier since the Mao era not to have previously worked at the State Council, China’s cabinet, as vice premier, analysts say.  It was Li’s personal ties with Xi that appear to have clinched his promotion over more qualified candidates, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said when Li was promoted last year.  But some analysts said his tenure in Shanghai, particularly before last year’s Covid lockdown, pointed to a pragmatic, pro-business style.  During Li’s time there, Tesla built its first gigafactory outside the United States in the city. Tesla has sole ownership of that factory, the first foreign automaker in China to wholly own its plant.  “China’s business environment should turn more friendly, at least, in the coming two years” under Li, who is likely to support private companies and foreign investors, Citi analysts said in a research report.  In 2019, Li also oversaw the launch of China’s Nasdaq-style stock market on the Shanghai stock exchange.

Micronesia's President David Panuelo at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, December 13, 2019.Noel Celis/Pool/Reuters/FILEHong KongCNN      The outgoing president of Micronesia has accused China of engaging in “political warfare” in the Pacific, in an explosive letter advocating for the the dissolution of diplomatic ties with Beijing.  In the 13-page letter, which CNN has obtained, David Panuelo alleges China is preparing to invade the self-ruled island of Taiwan, and has engaged in bribery, political interference and even “direct threats” to ensure the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) remains neutral in the event of war.  China dismissed the letter’s contents as “smears and accusations.”  “I would like to emphasize that China has always upheld the equality of all countries – no matter their size – and has always respected how Micronesia chooses its own development, based on its own circumstances,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Friday in a regular press briefing.   Panuelo, who has previously been critical of Beijing’s actions in the Pacific region, revealed he had considered switching diplomatic recognition to Taipei.  “China is seeking to ensure that, in the event of a war in our Blue Pacific continent between themselves and Taiwan, that the FSM is, at best, aligned with the PRC (China) instead of the United States, and, at worst, that the FSM chooses to ‘abstain’ altogether,” he wrote.  The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan as its own territory – despite having never governed it – and has refused to rule out the use of force to “reunify” it with mainland China.  Panuelo also accused China of “political warfare” in his country, which he claimed included overt activities – such as political alliances, economic measures and public propaganda – and clandestine acts such as “bribery, psychological warfare, and blackmail”.  “One of the reasons that China’s political warfare is successful in so many arenas is that we are bribed to be complicit, and bribed to be silent. That’s a heavy word, but it is an accurate description regardless,” he wrote in the letter.  CNN has reached out to Panuelo and Taiwan’s foreign ministry for comment.

Putin's war has not changed that, data showPanuelo, whose term in office is set to expire in two months after losing his seat in the recent general election, has been president of Micronesia since 2019.   He has previously spoken out on China’s growing influence in the South Pacific, including warning against Beijing’s proposal of a sweeping regional security deal with 10 Pacific Island nations.  Last May, in a separate letter to 22 Pacific leaders seen by CNN, Panuelo said the draft proposal was intended to shift Pacific Island nations with diplomatic ties to China “very close into Beijing’s orbit.”  He argued that in addition to impacting the sovereignty of Pacific Island nations, signing such an agreement could bring about a new “Cold War” amid tensions between China and the West.  China ultimately failed in its bid to strike the security pact with Pacific Island nations.  The release of Panuelo’s latest – and most explosive – letter comes amid heightened concern from regional powers over Beijing’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.  The Pacific Islands’ location, largely to the northeast of Australia, means the island nations have long been viewed by military strategists as a vital connecting thread between the US territory of Guam and US-allied Australia.  Both the US and Australia are wary of a China that has grown increasingly assertive in the South China Sea extending its reach further west into Pacific waters, including toward the FSM, an archipelago of more than 600 islands.   Meanwhile, the island nations themselves – typically more concerned about the ravages of climate change than geopolitics – have been wary of being viewed as pawns in a great power struggle.  China’s interest in building rapport with the Pacific Islands countries is not new.

CRISTINO/Pool via REUTERS     TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY     Mark R. Cristino/ReutersXi Jinping secures unprecedented third term as China's president in ceremonial voteIn the early 2000s, as the US was turning its attention toward perceived threats in the Middle East, a newly outward-looking China was starting on a path to become an economic and diplomatic partner for Pacific island countries.  A focal point of Beijing’s outreach was to win friends away from Taiwan, which is now only formally recognized by four of 14 South Pacific nations, after the Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched allegiance to China in 2019.  In recent years, as Beijing has pursued a more assertive foreign policy and expanded development funding globally in a bid to enhance its international sway, its visibility in the Pacific Islands, too, has grown.   China has backed widely publicized projects in some Pacific Island countries – a national sports stadium to host the Pacific Games in the Solomon Islands, highways in Papua New Guinea, bridges in Fiji – and sent high-level envoys to the region, including two visits from Chinese leader Xi Jinping, once in 2014 and again in 2018.   It’s also become a major trading partner for Pacific Island economies.

The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. CNN      With the shocking failure of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, I’m sure the lights are on late this weekend at the White House, Treasury, Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Darrell DuffieStanford UniversitySVB, the second largest US bank ever to go under, was hit by a garden-variety bank run accelerated by a high concentration of large uninsured deposits. Yes, there were failures of risk management and regulatory supervision. And there are likely some other banks whose balance sheets have been similarly weakened by the rapid increases in interest rates, which dramatically diminished the value of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. According to FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg last week, banks have yet to recognize about $620 billion of losses in market value caused by rising interest rates.   Despite the panic over SVB’s collapse, this situation isn’t likely to morph into a broader banking crisis. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the largest US banks have been forced by regulators to be much more resilient. They also rely far more heavily than SVB on retail depositors, who tend to have a greater share of their deposits covered by FDIC insurance and are less prone to run at the first sign of trouble.  Of more immediate concern is the potentially systemic impact this will have on the tech sector, which has already seen mass layoffs and investments shrivel up in recent months. Close to half of all listed US venture-backed tech and health care firms were SVB customers and many of these companies were racing to line up funds to make payroll in the aftermath of the collapse.  US President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the Homeland Security Department's 20th Anniversary ceremony at the Homeland Security Department in Washington, U.S., March 1, 2023. Leah Millis/ReutersOpinion: Is cutting the deficit by $3 trillion enough? Not even closeGiven US strategic technology objectives and the broader implications for national security, the government should intervene if a significant portion of these tech firms need cash to survive.   It’s possible that may not be necessary — if most of the affected tech depositors have sufficient alternative sources of cash or can be quickly restructured in bankruptcy and continue to bring their innovations to market, then the government doesn’t need to intervene with taxpayer-funded support.    If, however, a large fraction cannot survive, then it is in the US government’s own interests to step in. It can do that in a number of different ways. The SVB catastrophe could, for example, serve as a catalyst for the government to establish a new domestic industrial development bank, as proposed by Senator Chris Coons, which could provide bridge loans to the tech industry. For some tech startups, the Small Business Administration could step in with emergency loans, as was done when Covid hit in March 2020. California and the federal government each have a Technology Modernization Fund that could potentially provide grants to keep specific types of research and development alive. But these approaches may be too slow. Many tech firms that lost access to their SVB deposits may be unable to keep the lights on for long.   There are already signs that the government is taking swift action. The FDIC, the government agency charged with SVB’s workout and insuring some of its deposits, has said that insured depositors would have access to their deposits by Monday, and that it would pay uninsured depositors an “advance dividend within the next week.” Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook But plenty more may need to be done. The tech sector is an engine of economic growth and a key element of US national security, especially given the rivalry between the US and China. If the government decides that it needs to help the tech sector through this mess, then it will need to act quickly.

View more opinion at CNN.CNN      It was the handshake heard round the world. Indeed, the agreement between long-time foes Saudi Arabia and Iran to bury the hatchet and re-establish diplomatic relations after years of confrontation and religious hostility, must inevitably take a back seat to the venue and the peacemaker who brokered this landmark pact.  Suddenly, Chinese President Xi Jinping, in his first major initiative just hours after claiming an unprecedented third term in office, has shown his ability to play peacemaker for one of the most toxic relationships in a strategically critical and often unstable region. The mediator role is one that Xi has clearly lusted after for some time, most recently in his offer to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, viewed with the deepest skepticism by Ukraine and most of its western allies. Friday’s deal was an aggressive move by China, but it may pay off in spades.  China has secured its status as a close friend and reliable partner to two of the world’s leading oil producers. Iran is also prospectively the world’s newest nuclear-armed power, while the US has faithfully guaranteed Saudi Arabia’s security for generations. Until now.    Both are nations vital to China’s own strategic interests — particularly its need for reliable sources of oil as counterweights to Russian supplies that could prove increasingly problematic if the Ukraine conflict continues unabated. China has been importing oil at a pace of some 10 million barrels per day, according to official Chinese data in tons estimated in barrels by Reuters’ Asia Commodities and Energy Columnist Clyde Russell, a figure that is expected to surge this year as Covid lockdowns have lifted.  Last year, China purchased more Iranian crude oil than it did before a 2017 peak when there were no sanctions on Iranian oil exports, according to three tanker trackers monitored by Reuters. At the same time, China has found itself being forced to compete with rival India for cheap Russian crude oil. New, reliable sources from the Middle East could prove most attractive. In December, Xi paid his first visit to Saudi Arabia in nearly seven years and oil was at the top of the agenda.

Its people are not At the same time, China has long lusted after a firm strategic foothold in the Middle East and Gulf regions. Five years ago, it pressured Djibouti into allowing a Chinese naval facility that dominates the entrance to the Red Sea to be built on its shore, just up the coast from the major American facility of Camp Lemonnier. But a toehold on the Middle East mainland has so far eluded it, as Russia has expanded its own military facilities with air and naval facilities in Syria.  But any number of questions remain. How likely, now, is Saudi normalization of relations with Israel? In search of such a gesture, the Saudis have been negotiating with Brett McGurk, the National Security Council’s coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, and Amos Hochstein, the top White House aide for global energy. In January, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that, given a recent discovery of indigenous uranium reserves, the Kingdom intended to advance its plans to develop a front-end nuclear fuel-cycle, and was seeking US input (potentially a first step toward a nuclear weapon). The Saudis have also been anxious to receive pledges to resume arms transfers that had been blocked over its human rights record and refusal to back Ukraine in its war with Russia, and for increased security guarantees. A rapprochement with Iran, despite its ambition of destroying the state of Israel and Israel’s intention of pulverizing any Iranian nuclear weapons program, could be seen as a more feasible or appealing course of action for the Saudis.  At the same time, the proxy civil war in Yemen rages on, where Saudi-backed government forces have fought for more than eight years to a debilitating and bloody standoff with Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The United States has been especially anxious to bring a lasting end to hostilities. The first major initiative taken by President Joe Biden days after taking office was an announcement that Washington would no longer support the Saudi war effort there. Yet the war continued to grind on. This new China-brokered agreement is the first potential breakthrough for an end to hostilities — and without any American participation.  A winding down of American influence in the region has been clear for some time. Last July, Biden shared a much-publicized fist-bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, only to have it turned around as a slap in the face three months later when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) announced it would be slashing oil production by 2 million barrels per day — engineered, by most accounts, by Saudi Arabia and Russia to keep oil prices high. With Friday’s announcement in Beijing, Saudi Arabia appears to have thrown in its lot ever more defiantly with China and its close friend Russia. Saudi Arabia has never condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, nor has Russia condemned the Saudi proxy war in Yemen.  So, what should be the American position in all this? Clearly, any end to the hostilities or even a truce between the two principal and virulently opposed religious currents in Islam — the Sunnis (the majority in Saudia Arabia) and Shiites (the majority in Iran) — should be welcome news.

That Friday’s accord between Iran and Saudi Arabia was undertaken with the good offices of China is most disquieting but should not in any way distract from American efforts to contain China’s ambitious expansion. The big surprise is that China appears to have stepped in to fill the vacuum left by American vacillation in the Middle East. But on Monday, Biden is expected to announce a $100 billion deal with Great Britain to build a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia — a vital step toward countering China’s increasing dominance of the seas in the Pacific.  With this agreement, the stakes have only intensified. China, as well as Saudi Arabia and Iran, appear intent on only expanding their reach and power in their respective regions, making containment an increasingly appropriate goal for the United States.

China Daily/ReutersLondonCNN      When Saudi Arabia and Iran buried the hatchet in Beijing on Friday, it was a game-changing moment both for a Middle East shaped by their decades-old rivalry, and for China’s growing influence in the oil-rich region.   The announcement was surprising yet expected. The two regional powerhouses have been in talks to re-establish diplomatic relations for nearly two years. At times, negotiators seemed to drag their feet, the deep distrust between the two countries appearing immovable.   Iran’s talks with Saudi Arabia were unfolding at the same time as negotiations between Iran and the United States to revive the 2016 nuclear deal were faltering. The outcomes of both sets of Iran talks seemed interlinked – Riyadh and Washington have long walked in lockstep on foreign policy.  But a shift in regional alliances is afoot. Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the US has become strained in recent years, while China’s standing has risen. Unlike Washington, Beijing has shown an ability to transcend the many rivalries that criss-cross the Middle East. China has forged good diplomatic relations with countries across the region, driven by strengthening economic ties, without the Western lectures on human rights.

Parsi argues that the development should trigger a moment of introspection on Washington’s Middle East policy. “What should worry American decision-makers is if this becomes the new norm: the US becomes so deeply embroiled in the conflicts of our regional partners that our manoeuvrability evaporates and our past role as a peacemaker is completely ceded to China,” he added.

Saudi Press Agency//Reuters    End of a dark era Friday’s agreement could herald the end of a blood-drenched era in the Middle East. Riyadh and Tehran have been at ideological and military loggerheads since Iran’s Islamic Revolution installed an anti-Western, Shia theocracy in 1979.   Those tensions began to escalate into a region-wide proxy war after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq spiraled into civil conflict, with both Iran and Saudi Arabia vying for influence in the petrol-rich Arab country.   Armed conflict that pitted Saudi-backed militants against Iran-backed armed groups washed over much of the region in the decade and a half that followed.   In Yemen, a Saudi-led coalition military campaign to quash Iranian-backed rebels triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. In Syria, Iran supported President Bashar al-Assad as he brutalized his own people, only to find his forces facing off with rebels backed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. In Lebanon too, Iran and Saudi Arabia have backed different factions, contributing to a two-decade-long political crisis that has exacted a huge economic and security toll on the tiny eastern Mediterranean country.   Diplomatic relations were officially severed in 2016 when Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shia Saudi cleric Nimr al-Nimr, leading rioters in Tehran to torch the Saudi embassy.   But a slew of economic problems triggered by the pandemic and costly wars may have eroded the appetite for conflict, and Saudi and Iranian officials say they are eager to turn the page on that dark chapter.  The détente appears to go far beyond the resumption of diplomatic relations. Saudi and Iranian officials say they will also work to reimplement a decades-old security cooperation pact and revive an even older agreement on technology, and trade.   It’s a rare piece of good news for a region still reeling from their rivalry. How that plays out – and whether it can undo the havoc wreaked by the rivalry – remains to be seen.   But analysts say that China’s growing leverage in the region helped hedge both countries’ bets, changing a now-outdated political calculus that once made Western capitals the most likely venue for watershed regional accords.   “China is now the godfather of this agreement and given China’s strategic importance to Iran, that holds tremendous weight,” Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst familiar with the Saudi leadership’s thinking, told CNN.   “If Iran were to break this agreement, it will be hurting its ties to China that has put its full prestige into the ‘tripartite’ agreement.”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

General Li Shangfu at the opening ceremony of China's 19th Party Congress in 2017.Mark Schiefelbein/AP/FILECNN      China on Sunday appointed a US-sanctioned general as its new defense minister.   The country’s rubber-stamp legislature unanimously confirmed the appointment of General Li Shangfu, a veteran of the People’s Liberation Army’s modernization drive, during a session on Sunday.  Experts said the appointment would be closely watched by Washington given Li’s background, even though the post is viewed as largely diplomatic and ceremonial.  In 2018, the administration of former US President Donald Trump sanctioned Li and China’s Equipment Development Department – which he was in charge of at the time – for purchasing Russian weapons, including a Su-35 combat aircraft and a S-400 surface-to-air missile system.    His appointment was one of a series confirmed by China’s National People’s Congress during its Sunday sitting. Other senior appointments included four new vice premiers – Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing, and Liu Guozhong.   Following their nomination by the new premier Li Qiang, all four will serve as vice premiers on the State Council, the body responsible for reviving China’s economy after three years of strict zero-Covid restrictions.   The appointment of Li Shangfu as defense minister comes at a time of increasingly strained relations between Beijing and Washington.   Defense experts told Reuters that his appointment likely reflected a reward for his work in modernizing China’s military.  In 2016, Li was named deputy commander of the PLA’s then-new Strategic Support Force, an elite body tasked with accelerating the development of China’s space and cyber warfare capabilities. He was then appointed head of the Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC), China’s governing defense body, headed by the country’s leader Xi Jinping, Reuters reported.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies told Reuters.  “I think he has been elevated to this position because he’s delivered for Xi Jinping in key areas of modernisation,” Singapore-based security analyst Alexander Neill from Hawaii’s Pacific Forum think-tank told Reuters.   “This is someone who will have to hold their own in front of an international audience.”    With additional reporting by Reuters and previous reporting from CNN’s Nicole Gaouette and Marshall Cohen.

US Air Force When China shot down five U-2 spy planes at the height of the Cold War    			By Brad Lendon and Wayne Chang, CNN		  Updated  7:55 PM EST, Fri March 10, 2023    Link Copied!   A U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" in a hangar at Osan Air Base, South Korea, on Oct. 22, 2020. US Air ForceSeoul, South KoreaCNN      When a Chinese high-altitude balloon suspected of spying was spotted over the United States recently, the US Air Force responded by sending up a high-flying espionage asset of its own: the U-2 reconnaissance jet.   It was the Cold-War era spy plane that took the high-resolution photographs – not to mention its pilot’s selfie – that reportedly convinced Washington the Chinese balloon was gathering intelligence and not, as Beijing continues to insist, studying the weather.  In doing so, the plane played a key role in an event that sent tensions between the world’s two largest economies soaring, and shone an international spotlight on the methods the two governments use to keep tabs on each other.  Until now, most of the media’s focus has been on the balloon – specifically, how a vessel popularly seen as a relic of a bygone era of espionage could possibly remain relevant in the modern spy’s playbook. Yet to many military historians, it is the involvement of that other symbol of a bygone time, the U-2, that is far more telling.   The U-2 has a long and storied history when it comes to espionage battles between the US and China. In the 1960s and 1970s, at least five of them were shot down while on surveillance missions over China.  Those losses haven’t been as widely reported as might be expected – and for good reason. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which was responsible for all of America’s U-2s at the time the planes were shot down, has never officially explained what they were doing there.   Adding to the mystery was that the planes were being flown not by US pilots nor under a US flag, but by pilots from Taiwan who, in a striking parallel to today’s balloon saga, claimed to be involved in a weather research initiative.  A US Air Force pilot looks down at the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon from the cockpit of his U-2 spy plane on February 3, 2023.US Department of Defense    The Dragon Lady and Chinese nukesThat the CIA would be tight-lipped over what these American-built spy planes were doing is hardly surprising.   But the agency’s continued silence more than 50 years later – it did not respond to a CNN request for comment on this article – speaks volumes about just how sensitive the issue was both at the time and remains today.   The US government has a general rule of 25 years for automatic declassification of sensitive material. However, one of its often-cited reasons for ignoring this rule is in those cases where revealing the information would “cause serious harm to relations between the US and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the US.”  Contemporary accounts of what the planes were doing – by the Taiwan pilots who were shot down, retired US Air Force officers and military historians among them – leave little doubt as to why it would have caused a stir.  The planes – according to accounts by the pilots in a Taiwan-made documentary film and histories published on US government websites – had been transferred to Taiwan as part of a top-secret mission to snoop on Communist China’s growing military capabilities, including its nascent nuclear program, which was receiving help from the Soviet Union.  'Like walking on missiles': US airman recalls the horror of the Vietnam 'Christmas bombings' 50 years onThe newly developed U-2, nicknamed the Dragon Lady, appeared to offer the perfect vessel. The US had already used it to spy on the Soviet’s domestic nuclear program as its high-altitude capabilities – it was designed in the 1950s to reach “a staggering and unprecedented altitude of 70,000 feet,” in the words of its developer Lockheed – put it out of the range of antiaircraft missiles.  Or so the US had thought. In 1960, the Soviets shot down a CIA-operated U-2 and put its pilot Gary Powers on trial. Washington was forced to abandon its cover story (that Powers had been on a weather reconnaissance mission and had drifted into Soviet airspace after blacking out from oxygen depletion), admit the spy plane program, and barter for Powers to be returned in a prisoner swap.  “Since America didn’t want to have its own pilots shot down in a U-2 the way Gary Powers had been over the Soviet Union in 1960, which caused a major diplomatic incident, they turned to Taiwan, and Taiwan was all too willing to allow its pilots to be trained and to do a long series of overflights over mainland China,” Chris Pocock, author of “50 Years of the U-2,” explained in the 2018 documentary film “Lost Black Cats 35th Squadron.”  A mobile chase car pursues a U-2 Dragon Lady as it prepares to land at Beale Air Force Base in California in June 2015.US Air Force    The Black Cats and Detachment HLike the U-2, Taiwan – also known as the Republic of China (ROC) – seemed a perfect choice for the mission. The self-governing island to the east of the Chinese mainland was at odds with the Communist leadership in Beijing – as it remains today – and at that time in history had a mutual defense treaty with Washington.  That treaty has long since lapsed, but Taiwan remains a point of major tensions between China and the United States, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping vowing to bring it under the Communist Party’s control and Washington still obligated to provide it with the means to defend itself.  Today, the US sells F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan as part of that obligation. In the 1960s, Taiwan got the US-made U-2s.  The island’s military set up a squadron that would officially be known as the “Weather Reconnaissance and Research Section.”   But its members – pilots from Taiwan who had been trained in the US to fly U-2s – knew it by a different name: the “Black Cats.”   The author Pocock and Gary Powers Jr., the son of the pilot shot down by the Soviets and the co-founder of the Cold War Museum in Washington, DC, explained the thinking behind the squadron and its mission in the 2018 documentary film.The other CIA unit in Taiwan  Coinciding with the Black Cat Squadron, the Black Bat Squadron was formed under the cooperation of the Central Intelligence Agency and Taiwan’s air force, according to a Taiwan Defense Ministry website.While the Black Cats were in charge of high-altitude reconnaissance missions, the Black Bats conducted low-altitude reconnaissance and electronic intelligence gathering missions over mainland China from May 1956. It also operated in Vietnam in tandem with the US during the Vietnam War.Between 1952 to 1972, the Black Bats lost 15 aircraft and 148 lives, according to the website.“The Black Cats program was implemented because the American government needed to find out information over mainland China – what were their strengths and weaknesses, where were their military installations located, where were their submarine bases, what type of aircraft were they developing,” said Powers Jr.  Lloyd Leavitt, a retired US Air Force lieutenant general, described the mission as “a joint intelligence operation by the United States and the Republic of China.”    “American U-2s were painted with ROC insignia, ROC pilots were under the command of a ROC (Air Force) colonel, overflight missions were planned by Washington, and both countries were recipients of the intelligence gathered over the mainland,” Leavitt wrote in a 2010 personal history of the Cold War published by the Air Force Research Institute in Alabama.  One of the first men to fly the U-2 for Taiwan was Mike Hua, who was there when the first of the planes arrived at Taoyuan Air Base in Taiwan in early 1961.   “The cover story was that the ROC (air force) had purchased the aircraft, that bore the (Taiwanese) national insignia. … To avoid being confused with other air force organizations stationed in Taoyuan, the section became the 35th Squadron with the Black Cat as its insignia,” Hua wrote in a 2002 history of the unit for the magazine Air Force Historical Foundation.  At the Taiwan airbase, Americans worked with the Taiwan pilots, helping to maintain the aircraft and process the information. They were know as Detachment H, according to Hua.  “All US personnel were ostensibly employees of the Lockheed Aircraft Company,” Hua wrote.Code name: RazorThe ROC air force and US representatives inked an agreement on the operation, giving it the code name “Razor,” Hua wrote.  He described the intelligence gained by the flights as “tremendous” and said it was shared between Taipei and Washington.  “The missions covered the vast interior of the Chinese mainland, where almost no aerial photographs had ever been taken,” he wrote. “Each mission brought back an aerial photographic map of roughly 100 miles wide by 2,000 miles long, which revealed not only the precise location of a target, but also the activities on the ground.”  Other sensors on the spy planes gathered information on Chinese radar capabilities and more, he said.  Between January 1962 and May 1974, according to a history on Taiwan’s Defense Ministry’s website, the Black Cats flew 220 reconnaissance missions covering “more than 10 million square kilometers over 30 provinces in the Chinese mainland.”   When asked for further comment on the Black Cats, the ministry referred CNN to the published materials.  “The idea was that black cats go out at night, and the U-2 would usually launch in the darkness. Their cameras were the eyes, and it was very stealthy, quiet, and hard to get. And so combining the two stories, they became known as the Black Cats,” the author Pocock said in the documentary.  The squadron even had its own patch, reputedly drawn by one of its members, Lt. Col. Chen Huai-sheng, and inspired by a local establishment frequented by the pilots.  But the Black Cats, like Powers Sr. two years before, were about to find out their U-2s were not impervious to antiaircraft fire.   On September 9, 1962, Chen became the first U-2 pilot to be shot down by a People’s Liberation Army antiaircraft missile. His plane went down while on a mission over Nanchang, China.

It was a cat-and-mouse game, literally a black cat and mouse game between the routines from the flights from Taiwan and those air defense troops of the (Chinese) mainland, working out where the next flight would go.”  In July 1964, Lt. Col. Lee Nan-ping’s U-2 was shot down by a PLA SA-2 missile over Chenghai, China. According to the Taiwan Defense Ministry he was flying out of a US naval air station in the Philippines and trying to gain information on China’s supply routes to North Vietnam.  In September 1967, a PLA missile hit the U-2 being flown by Capt. Hwang Rung-pei over Jiaxin, China, and in May 1969, Maj. Chang Hsieh suffered a “flight control failure” over the Yellow Sea while reconnoitering the coast of Hebei province, China. No trace of his U-2 was ever found, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry.  A U-2 Dragon Lady, from Beale Air Force Base, lands at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, in 2017. US Air Force    Captured by the CommunistsTwo other Taiwanese U-2 pilots were shot down but survived, only to spend years in Communist captivity.  Maj. Robin Yeh was shot down in November 1963 over Jiujiang, Jiangxi province.   “The plane lost control when the explosion of the missile took out part of the left wing. The plane spiraled down. Lots of shrapnel flew into the plane and hit both of my legs,” Yeh, who died in 2016, recalled in “The Brave in the Upper Air: An Oral History of The Black Cat Squadron” published by Taiwan’s Defense Ministry.  He said that following his capture Chinese doctors removed 59 pieces of shrapnel from his legs, but couldn’t take it all out.  “It didn’t really affect my daily life, but during winter my legs would hurt, which affected my mobility. I guess this would be my lifelong memory,” Yeh said.  Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, pictured in 2022.Anupam/Adobe StockUncontacted tribes and an Indian military base. Did a 'spy' balloon snoop on the Andaman and Nicobar islands?Maj. Jack Chang’s U-2 was hit by a missile over Inner Mongolia in 1965. He, too, suffered dozens of shrapnel injuries and bailed out, landing on a snowy landscape.  “It was dark at the time, preventing me from seeking help anyway, so I had to wrap myself up tightly with the parachute to keep myself warm … After ten hours when dawn broke, I saw a village of yurts afar, so I dragged myself and sought help there. I collapsed as soon as I reached a bed,” he recalled in the oral history.  Neither Yeh nor Chang, who were assumed killed in action, would see Taiwan again for decades. The pilots were eventually released in 1982 into Hong Kong, which at the time was still a British colony.  However, the world into which they emerged had changed greatly in the intervening years. The US no longer had a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and had formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.  Though the Cold War US-Taiwan alliance was no longer, the CIA brought the two pilots to the US to live until they were finally allowed to return to Taiwan in 1990.  Members of the 5th Reconnaissance Squadron ""Black Cats"" work on a U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" at Osan Air Base on Oct. 22, 2020.US Air Force    No regretsIndeed, by the time of their release CIA control of the U-2 program had long since ceased. It had turned the planes over to the US Air Force in 1974, according to a US Air Force history.Two years later, the Air Force’s 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron and its U-2s moved into Osan Air Base in South Korea. Commander Lt. Col. David Young gave the location the “Black Cat” moniker.  Today, the unit is known as the 5th Reconnaissance Squadron.  But US U-2s continue to be involved in what might be characterized as “cat-and-mouse” activities and their activities continue to make waves occasionally in China. In 2020, Beijing accused the US of sending a U-2 into a no-fly zone to “trespass” on live-fire exercises being conducted by China below.  The US Pacific Air Forces confirmed to CNN at the time that the flight had taken place, but said it did not violate any rules.  Meanwhile, for those involved in the original Black Cats, there are few regrets – even for those who were captured.  Yeh told the documentary makers he had fond memories of life at 70,000 feet.  “We were literally up in the air. The view we had was also different; we had the bird’s eye view. Everything we saw was vast,” he said.  Chang too felt no bitterness.  “I love flying,” he said. “I didn’t die, so I have no regrets.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  USCrime + Justice    Energy + Environment    Extreme Weather    Space + ScienceWorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomPoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessTech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosMarketsPre-markets    After-Hours    Market Movers    Fear & Greed    World Markets    Investing    Markets Now    Before the Bell    NightcapOpinionPolitical Op-Eds    Social CommentaryHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsPro Football    College Football    Basketball    Baseball    Soccer    Olympics    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRAudio  CNN UnderscoredElectronics    Fashion    Beauty    Health & Fitness    Home    Reviews    Deals    Money    Gifts    Travel    Outdoors    Pets    CNN StoreCoupons  WeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

By Kathleen Magramo, CNN		  Updated  10:04 PM EST, Sat March 11, 2023    Link Copied!   The Penny's Bay Community Isolation Facility in Hong Kong on March 1, 2023.Noemi Cassanelli/CNNHong KongCNN      Behind the gleaming skyscrapers and multimillion-dollar homes that have made this city the world’s most expensive property market lies a far less attractive parallel reality: one of the world’s seemingly most intractable housing crises.  Welcome to Hong Kong, where the average home sells for well north of a million dollars – and even a parking space can go for close to a million – but where more than 200,000 people face waits of at least half a decade for subsidized public housing.   Where far below the billionaire’s row of The Peak and its ultra-exclusive properties that routinely change hands for hundreds of millions of dollars, one in five people live below the poverty line – defined in Hong Kong as 50% of the median monthly household income before welfare – and many call home a cramped subdivided unit or even a cage in a dilapidated tenement block.   The cause of the problem, according to the city’s government, is relatively simple: a chronic lack of supply that is unable to meet the demand of more than 7 million residents crammed into what are already some of the world’s most densely populated neighborhoods.   Housing “tops the agenda,” the city’s chief executive John Lee insisted in his maiden policy address in October, as he pledged to build 30,000 units in the next five years – a promise that follows an order by the central government in Beijing to prioritize the issue.  But critics have long been skeptical of the local government’s reliance on land premiums, sales and taxes, which account for roughly 20% of its annual revenues. Critics say this income stream provides an incentive for it to keep supply tight, limiting what can be done to solve the problem.   CNN asked the Hong Kong government whether its revenue from land sales and premiums affects its housing policy. The Development Bureau replied that, “The government is firmly committed to maintaining a steady and sustained land supply through a multi-pronged approach to meet the housing and socio-economic development needs of the community.”   Units at Penny's Bay Community Isolation Facility sit empty on March 1, 2023.Noemi Cassanelli/CNNWhile that debate rages, the abrupt recent unraveling of the city’s harsh anti-Covid measures has thrown a curveball into the mix that – according to those same critics – offers a litmus test as to the government’s determination to solve the problem.   Many are now calling on the authorities to repurpose the vast Covid quarantine camps the city built during the pandemic to isolate hundreds of thousands of people and which currently lie empty and unused.  As Paul Zimmerman, a councilor in Hong Kong’s southern district and co-founder of the urban-planning advocacy group Designing Hong Kong, put it: “Now the question is: what to do with them?” Covid hangover and a litmus testThe answer to that question may be less straightforward than it at first seems.  The camps were one of Hong Kong’s more controversial anti-Covid measures – alongside the world’s longest mask mandate and compulsory hotel isolation periods of up to three weeks – and were opposed at the time of their construction not only among those who decried what they saw as draconian quarantine requirements.  The camps also raised the hackles of government critics who said their speedy and expensive construction gave the lie to the narrative that Hong Kong’s housing problem was simply unsolvable.  Hong Kong authorities have not revealed to the public how much the network of quarantine facilities cost. But its total spending bill on the pandemic in the past three years has run to $76 billion (HK$600 billion), according to the city’s financial secretary. CNN has reached out to the Chief Executive’s office, Security Bureau, Health Bureau and Development Bureau about the costs of building and running these quarantine camps.Inside a Hong Kong government quarantine centerSophie Jeong/CNNNegative Covid test, no close contact: How I ended up at a Hong Kong government quarantine campPublic housing plans are usually subject to years of red tape, but in the case of the quarantine camps the government managed to suddenly “find” around 80 hectares of land and build 40,000 pre-fabricated metal units in a matter of months.   Brian Wong, of the local think tank Liber Research Community, is among those who question why the government can’t take a similarly speedy approach and bypass red tape to solve what it has itself acknowledged is an urgent housing crisis.  Wong and others argue the government’s alleged reliance on land revenue is at risk of turning housing into “a structural problem” that cannot be “meaningfully solved.”  “Even if the government wants to make land affordable, they won’t do that because there’s too much at stake,” said Wong, who is critical of what he sees as official indecision and inaction that he says comes at the expense of the city’s poorest people.  He sees the vacant camps as offering a litmus test of the government’s determination to act and has called for the units to be repurposed into social housing, arguing that it would be “very embarrassed if those containers are left vacant or wasted.”   CNN has asked the Hong Kong government what it plans to do with the former quarantine camps. It said it would announce its plans “after a decision is made.”Small, but still desirableOnly three out of the eight purpose-built quarantine and isolation camps have actually been used; the remaining five were put on stand-by as vaccination rates rose and infection numbers dipped.  The largest and perhaps most infamous of the camps is Penny’s Bay, a site next to Hong Kong’s Disneyland, where more than 270,000 people stayed in nearly 10,000 units during its 958 days of operation that ended on March 1. A second is located next to the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and a third near a shipping container port. The rest are dotted along the city’s northern outskirts near the border with mainland China.  Measuring around 200 square feet, each unit is roughly the size of a car parking space and contains a simple toilet, shower and bed. Only some have kitchens.   Still, while the units are spartan, many argue they could still offer an attractive temporary solution for those who cannot afford the city’s high rents. In Hong Kong, according to data compiled by property agency Centaline, even “nano-flats” measuring 215 square feet have recently sold for as much as $445,000 – equivalent to more than $2,000 per square foot.   Francis Law, who was sent to Penny’s Bay in late 2022, said that while simple, the facilities were adequate to meet a person’s basic needs and would offer an attractive temporary option to those on public housing lists.   “If the government rents the units out for around HK$2,000 to HK$3,000 per month [$254 to $382] and arranges a bus route to the nearest train station, I think it would attract a lot of applicants, even if it’s far flung from the main central business district,” he told CNN.   While some of the camps have been built on land owned by local tycoons and loaned to the government, some argue that as the units are modular and relatively easily dismantled they could be moved to more permanent locations – if the government were so inclined.  A temporary isolation facility near to the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal in Hong Kong on April 6, 2022.Yan Zhao/AFP/Getty Images/File“We obviously have land in Hong Kong, we have a lot of rural areas…but what we do not have land that is readily available for residential or commercial development,” said Ryan Ip, vice-president and co-head of research at the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank.   “The key is whether the government actually expedites its procedures.”Getting creativeOthers have more creative suggestions, drawing inspiration from how some of the units were temporarily repurposed during lulls in the pandemic.  At one point, some of the units in Penny’s Bay were used to hold a university entrance exam for secondary school students who were close contacts of infected cases; at another time, the camp hosted a small election polling station.  Hong Kong-based architect Marco Siu is part of a group calling for the blocks at Penny’s Bay to be turned into a temporary health and wellness center, arguing that this would require only a minimal redesign and give authorities the option of reopening it should another outbreak happen.  Zimmerman, of Designing Hong Kong, said the land next to Disneyland could be used to expand the theme park or be repurposed into a new town.  Under Secretary for Security, Michael Cheuk, at the closing ceremony of the Penny's Bay Community Isolation Facility on March 1, 2023.Noemi Cassanelli/CNNWhether the government will heed any of these suggestions remains to be seen. It has so far been tight-lipped on its intentions.  A spokesperson told CNN that, “Detailed analysis and study will be conducted with relevant government bureaux and departments. Future plans and arrangements will be announced after a decision is made.”  However, a Development Bureau spokesperson added that the units at Penny’s Bay and Kai Tak were “structurally designed for a life cycle of 50 years” and confirmed that they are designed to be “dismantled, transported and reused in other locations.”  In a separate statement, the Development Bureau said the city was committed to a “steady and sustained” supply of land.  “To assume a leading role in land supply, the government has committed itself to a robust land supply strategy to meet demand and build up the land reserve through a multi-pronged approach, including, for example, the development of two strategic growth areas, namely the new supply of over 3,000 hectares of developable land in the Northern Metropolis and the reclamation of 1,000 hectares off Kau Yi Chau (island); and the expedition of the pace of urban renewal.  “As announced in the 2023-24 Budget, in respect of land for private housing alone, we will secure land of a scale which nearly doubles that of the previous five-year period for the production of no less than 72,000 private housing units in the coming five years, and make the land available to the market through the annual Land Sale Programs and railway property developments.”  Still, anyone who watched the closing ceremony for Penny’s Bay earlier this month would have been disappointed if they were hoping for a glimpse into what its future might hold.  As its gates closed, a band played “Auld Lang Syne” and Michael Cheuk, the Undersecretary for Security, placed a giant cut-out padlock on its bars.  “Penny’s Bay quarantine camp has accomplished its mission,” Cheuk told the crowd.  Those same words were plastered on a banner hung across its shuttered gates.

The Xi'an Bell Tower, pictured in December 2021 as the city conducted a citywide disinfection to prevent the spread of Covid.Li Wenbo/VCG/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      A Chinese city has sparked a backlash on social media after saying it would consider the use of lockdowns in the event of an influenza outbreak.  The city of Xi’an – a tourism hotspot in Shaanxi province that is home to the famous terracotta warriors – revealed an emergency response plan this week that would enable it to shut schools, businesses and “other crowded places” in the event of a severe flu epidemic.  That prompted a mixture of anxiety and anger on China’s social media websites among many users who said the plan sounded uncomfortably similar to some of the strict zero-Covid measures China had implemented throughout the pandemic and which have only recently been abandoned.  “Vaccinate the public rather than using such time to create a sense of panic,” one user wrote on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter.  “How will people not panic given that Xi’an’s proposal to suspend work and business activities were issued without clear instruction on the national level to classify the disease?” asked another.  While cases of Covid in China are falling, there has been a spike in flu cases across the country and some pharmacies are struggling to meet demand for flu remedies.

Rather, it outlines how the city of almost 13 million people would respond to any future outbreak based on four levels of severity.  At the first and highest level, it says, “the city can lock down infected areas, carry out traffic quarantines and suspend production and business activities. Shopping malls, theaters, libraries, museums, tourist attractions and other crowded places will also be closed.”  “At this emergency level, schools and nurseries at all levels would be shut down and be made responsible for tracking students’ and infants’ health conditions.”  The backlash comes as the central government in Beijing has emphasized the need to open the country back up following the removal of all Covid restrictions in January.  Throughout the pandemic, China had enforced some of the world’s most severe Covid restrictions, including lockdowns that stretched into months in some cities. It was also one of the last countries in the world to end measures such as mass testing and strict border quarantine periods, even amid growing evidence of the damage being done to its economy.  Xi’an itself was subject to a draconian lockdown between December 2021 and January 2022, with 13 million residents confined to their homes for weeks on end – and many left short of food and other essential supplies. Access to medical services was also affected. In an incident that shocked and angered the nation, a heavily pregnant woman was turned away from a hospital on New Year’s Day because she didn’t have a valid Covid-19 test, and suffered a miscarriage after she was finally admitted two hours later.

Cang Hai/Costfoto/Future Publishing/Getty ImgesShortly before China removed its pandemic era restrictions the country had been rocked by a series of demonstrations against its zero-Covid policy.  Memories of being confined to their homes and of panic buying that in some areas led to food shortages remain fresh in people’s minds and the idea of a return to Covid-style measures appears to have hit a nerve.  However, some voices called for calm.   Epidemiologist Ben Cowling, from the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, said he saw the rationale of the move.   “I think it’s quite rational to make contingency plans. I wouldn’t expect a lockdown to be needed for flu, but presumably there are different response levels,” he said.  One user on Weibo expressed a similar sentiment: “It is merely the revelation of a proposal, not putting it in place. It is quite normal to take precautions given this wave of flu is coming at us very strong.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

US President Joe Biden (L) and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (R) pictured in Jeddah on July 16, 2022.Mandel Ngan/Pool/AFP/Getty Images/FILEWashingtonCNN      Saudi Arabia is looking to the United States for security guarantees and help with its civilian nuclear program as a condition for normalizing relations with Israel, according to people familiar with the matter, setting up a critical decision that could reshape the political situation in the Middle East.   The discussions are ongoing, and it wasn’t clear precisely what the terms of any agreement might look like, if it ever comes to pass.   Ramping up security guarantees for Saudi Arabia would likely face stiff resistance from some members of Congress, who have called on the Biden administration to downgrade Washington’s relationship with Riyadh.   Still, President Joe Biden has placed importance on normalizing ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, as has Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who believe better relations between the two nations could help increase security in the Middle East. Israel and Saudi Arabia have been cultivating unofficial ties for several years, though remain without official diplomatic relations.  “The better the relations between Israel and their Arab neighbors, the better for everybody,” Biden said Friday at the end of a speech about the economy.   Israel has already secured diplomatic agreements with other Arab nations, including Morocco, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The Abraham Accords were a signature achievement of the Trump administration and Biden has vowed to build upon them, particularly as Iran’s nuclear program advances.   A spokesman for the US National Security Council declined to confirm Saudi Arabia was seeking security guarantees from the US, which were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.Instead, John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the NSC, pointed to accomplishments Biden secured when he visited Israel and Saudi Arabia over the summer.  “The President’s trip to the region accomplished a lot,” said Kirby, citing an agreement on contested Red Sea islands and a recent announcement by Oman it would allow Israeli overflights.  “We’re going to keep that diplomacy going,” he said.   The State Department did not reply to a request for comment. The Israeli Embassy in Washington had no comment.

Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty ImagesArchrivals Iran and Saudia Arabia agree to end years of hostilities in deal mediated by China  The consequences of a US-brokered agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia could be widespread. It would throw into doubt the future of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has seen renewed violence in recent weeks under Israel’s right-wing government.   US officials also believe normalizing relations would provide heft to a regional counterweight against Iran, which has advanced its nuclear enrichment over the last year.  Last year, Biden promised Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences” after the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil cartel unexpectedly announced it would cut production, though the Biden administration has no plans to take proactive steps to punish – let alone significantly reorient its posture toward – the oil-rich Middle East kingdom.  On Friday, Saudi Arabia and Iran announced that they had agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of hostility, in a deal between regional archrivals that could have wide-ranging implications for the Middle East.  Riyadh and Tehran plan to reopen their embassies in an agreement mediated by China, a joint statement by Saudi Arabia and Iran said on Friday.  Kirby said Saudi officials had kept the White House informed on the talks as they progressed. But he downplayed Beijing’s role in brokering the agreement, saying the roadmap to reestablishing ties also included talks in Iraq and Oman.

Sign up here.Abu Dhabi, UAECNN      Saudi Arabia and Iran announced on Friday that they had agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of hostility, in a deal between the regional archrivals that could have wide-ranging implications for the Middle East.   Riyadh and Tehran plan to reopen their embassies within two months in an agreement mediated by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran said in a joint statement after talks in Beijing on Friday.    They also plan to reimplement a security pact signed 22 years ago under which both parties agreed to cooperate on terrorism, drug-smuggling and money-laundering, as well as reviving a trade and technology deal from 1998.   Friday’s announcement is also a diplomatic victory for China in a Gulf region that has long been considered part of the US’ domain of influence. It comes as the Biden administration tries to notch its own win in the Middle East by trying to broker a normalization pact between Israel and Saudi Arabia.   Talks had been ongoing since March 6 in Beijing between Iranian national security chief Ali Shamkhani, Saudi national security council adviser Mosaed Bin Mohammad Al-Aiban and China’s top diplomat Wang Yi, according to Iranian state media.   Video of the signing ceremony aired by Iranian media showed officials seated around tables on opposite sides with the Saudi Arabian, Iranian and Chinese flags around them.

In an apparent push back to American influence, Wang said that “the world is not limited to the Ukraine issue” while emphasizing that the fate of the Middle East should be determined by the people of the Middle East.   “The foreign ministers of the two countries will meet each other to implement this decision and make necessary arrangements for the exchange of ambassadors,” the joint statement said. “The two sides agree to respect the sovereignty and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.”     Saudi Arabia and Iran had previously held talks aimed at reconciliation in Oman and Iraq.   Riyadh severed ties with Tehran in 2016 after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in the Iranian capital following the execution of a Shi’ite cleric in Saudi Arabia. Since then, they have fought a proxy war that has embroiled a number of neighboring countries, bringing the region ever closer to war.   In Yemen, the two countries have supported opposite sides of a civil war that has been described by the United Nations as one the world’s worst humanitarian crises. From there, the Houthi rebels have fired missiles at both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, targeting oil infrastructure that is vital to their economies.    Saudi Arabia has however been engaged in direct talks with the Houthis, and an unofficial ceasefire appears to be holding.   In a speech prior to the signing of the agreement with his Iranian counterpart, Saudi Arabia’s Al-Aiban called for non-interference in the sovereignty of states to be a “fundamental pillar for the development of relations.”  “We value what we have reached and we hope that we will continue the constructive dialogue, in accordance with the pillars and foundations included in the agreement,” he said.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian hailed the deal and said Tehran would step up its diplomatic efforts in the region.    “Iran and Saudi Arabia relations returning to normal makes the two countries, the region and the Muslim world stronger,” Amir-Abdollahian tweeted on Friday.   Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated on the global stage. Talks to revive Iran’s 2015 nuclear pact with world powers are frozen and relations with Western states have faced further strains due to the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on protests that started in September.   Iran’s main international ally Russia is preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, while China, its other ally, has lately been courting Tehran’s archrival Saudi Arabia.

In December, Chinese President Xi Jinping was welcomed in Riyadh in an extravagant ceremony as part of a visit that brought together 14 Arab heads of state. That was just months after a relatively low-key meeting with US President Joe Biden, whose relationship with Saudi Arabia has been frosty.“China’s role as a broker is striking, and could foreshadow a bolder diplomatic position,” said Sanam Vakil, a senior research fellow for the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House think-tank in London.    “But we should be cautious in overstating Beijing’s intentions. This is more about China’s interests in the region. China has brought together two key actors – regional and economic actors –  for the purpose of reducing regional tensions and facilitating greater economic engagement with both.”   Xiaofei Xu, Shawn Deng and Abbas Al Lawati contributed to this report.

US President Joe Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Friday, March 3, 2023. Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesCNN      President Joe Biden hoped to ease a serious source of tension with Europe when he met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the White House on Friday.  The dispute is technical but highly contentious. It comes at a moment – a year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – when unity between the US and its European allies is already being tested.  The quarrel centers on a provision of Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act that offered tax credits for electric vehicles. The law specifies in order to qualify for the credit, the vehicles must source a percentage of the material for their batteries from North America or countries with a free trade agreement with the US – which the EU does not.  The law has infuriated some of the United States’ top allies, like the EU, who say their countries are being penalized. The timing is inopportune, as Biden works to maintain transatlantic unity as the war in Ukraine enters a second year.  In their talks in the Oval Office on Friday, Biden and von der Leyen discussed the matter and announced a new set of negotiations that, if successful, would allow European companies to benefit from the Biden law and reduce both US and EU dependence on China.  “We have agreed that we will start work now with the clear goal: The goal is to have an agreement on critical raw materials that have been sourced or processed in the European Union, that these strategic supply chains are able to access the American market as if they had been sourced in the United States,” von der Leyen said outside the White House after the meeting concluded.  The two leaders also discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, including plans to deepen cooperation on enforcing sanctions against Russia and third-party countries who are supporting Moscow’s invasion. That could soon include China, which US officials have warned is considering providing lethal aid to Russia.  Yet it is the transatlantic economic issues that formed the center of the talks, particularly the disagreement over Biden’s climate law, which European officials have slammed as protectionist.   The agreement the two leaders announced centered on the critical minerals that are necessary for electric vehicle batteries, perhaps unlocking for Europe some of the Inflation Reduction Act’s benefits.  “I look forward to talking about all that with you,” Biden said at the meeting got underway in the Oval Office.   “We’re driving new investments to create clean energy industries and jobs and make sure we have supply chains available to both our continents,” Biden said as the meeting got underway in the Oval Office. “That idea underpins our Inflation Reduction Act, and it lies at the heart of the your green deal industrial plan for the EU, and so I hope we can talk about that today.”  If not resolved, the issue could potentially spiral into competing subsidies that neither side wants, and add to strains caused by the war in Ukraine.  “What we want to do is maximize the amount of deployment, maximize the speed of that deployment, and do so in a way that builds each of our respective industrial bases. That isn’t going to happen if our incentives and their incentives are misaligned, and compete with one another in a zero sum way,” a senior US administration official said ahead of the meeting.  After Biden signed the law last year, European allies reacted harshly, setting off a scramble within the administration to resolve the issues while not angering members of Congress who supported the Made-in-America aspects of the law.  Among the top proponents of the measure: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat whose support is critical for the White House on a number of issues.  Biden’s meeting Friday won’t completely resolve the matter, according to officials, but instead launch a process of arriving at a type of trade agreement that would meet the law’s requirements and allow European companies to help supply battery materials – like lithium and nickel – for electric vehicles.  US officials have been in similar discussions with counterparts from the United Kingdom and Japan to assuage those nations’ similar concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act.  It’s unclear how long the process might take.  “The goal here is to ensure that as we make our investments, as Europe make its investments, that our approaches are communicated, that we’re communicating with one another on our approaches so that we maximize the deployment of clean energy technology over time, and not that those incentives compete with one another,” the official said.

SVB Financial Group    (SIVB), which is partnered with nearly half of all venture-backed tech and health care companies in the United States, was forced to raise capital after it sold part of its portfolio of US Treasuries at a loss to cover a rapid decline in customer deposits.   The Nasdaq exchange suspended trading in SVB shares at 8.35 a.m. ET Friday after they fell 49% in premarket trading. Stocks in the company cratered 60% on Thursday.  “Lots of banks hold large portfolios of bonds and rising interest rates make these less valuable — the SVB situation is a reminder that many institutions are sitting on large unrealized losses on their fixed-income holdings,” commented Russ Mould, investment director at UK broker AJ Bell.  Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.9% in early trading, while London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100    (UKX) index slid 1.4%.   The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big European banks, including those in the United Kingdom, sank by more than 4% Friday morning before recovering slightly.  Shares in banking giant HSBC    (HSBC) tumbled 4.5% Friday. The shares of Barclays    (BCS) were down 3.6%, Deutsche Bank    (DB) 6.8% and Italy’s Unicredit     (UNCFF)4%.   In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng     (HSNGY)led losses in the region, sinking 3%, while China’s Shanghai and Korea’s Kospi fell 1.4% and 1% respectively.  Asian markets have also been pressured this week because China has failed to announce any major economic stimulus during its National People’s Congress.   Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei ended Friday down 1.7% as the country’s central bank decided to keep its ultra-low interest rates unchanged.    US stocks dipped in pre-market trading, before recovering to post modest gains by 9.07 a.m. ET.Fall from graceThe losses come after US bank stocks logged the largest falls in nearly three years on Thursday. The KBW Bank Index, which tracks 24 leading US banks, fell 7.7%, its biggest drop in almost three years.  The Dow closed lower by 543 points, or 1.7%, Thursday. The S&P 500 fell by 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.1%.  The selloff is a sharp turnaround for the global banking sector, which, until Thursday, had enjoyed surging stock valuations since last fall.   On one hand, high interest rates have been a boon for banks, helping them make heftier returns on loans to households and businesses, and as savers deposit more of their money into savings accounts.  But, on the other, some large banks that had scooped up expensive Treasuries and other bonds when interest rates were very low, are sitting on losses as borrowing costs have risen and bond prices have gone down.   Banks heavily exposed to the tech sector, like SVB, are particularly at risk as cash-hungry startups withdraw their deposits.

Germany shootingSeven people were killed during a mass shooting on Thursday at a Jehovah’s Witnesses Kingdom Hall in the German city of Hamburg in what the country’s leader denounced as a “brutal act of violence.” The alleged perpetrator also died in the incident, Hamburg police said. There is “no confirmed information on the motive for the crime,” police said in a statement. As the investigation remains ongoing, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has led politicians in denouncing the murder spree in the northern German city. “Several members of a Jehovah community fell victim to a brutal act of violence last night. My thoughts are with them and their loved ones,” he wrote on Twitter today.2. Mexico kidnappingA week after the kidnapping of four Americans in Mexico, investigators are still working to piece together how and why the abduction unfolded. This comes after a cartel apologized for carrying out what one victim’s father has called “a senseless crime” that left two Americans and one Mexican woman dead. The Gulf Cartel, which is believed to be responsible for the kidnapping, also issued an alleged apology letter and handed over five of its members to local authorities. The tight-knit group of friends had traveled from South Carolina to Matamoros so that one of them could undergo a medical procedure – but they were violently intercepted by gunmen who fired into their vehicle, loaded them into the back of a truck and took them away.   Video Ad FeedbackFriend of Americans kidnapped in Mexico recounts the moments before they went missing    06:35   - Source:CNN    3. Biden’s BudgetPresident Joe Biden released his annual budget Thursday, outlining his policy priorities for the year ahead. Biden’s 2024 budget mostly rehashed the president’s earlier proposals to expand the social safety net and to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations. He wants to restore the expanded child tax credit and make permanent enhanced Obamacare subsidies. And he wants to provide universal free preschool, make college more affordable and establish a national paid family and medical leave program. However, the proposed budget has no chance of making it through the Republican-controlled House. It could still frame upcoming political battles on Capitol Hill, where the GOP has yet to unveil its own spending plan.

The reappointment of Xi, China’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, was largely seen as a formality after the 69-year-old secured a norm-shattering third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party last fall. In 2018, China’s legislature abolished presidential term limits in a ceremonial vote, effectively allowing Xi to rule for life. Nevertheless, his reappointment as head of state officially completes his transition into a second decade in power.

Gun lawsA federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a Florida law that raised the minimum age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21. The law was initially passed after 17 people were killed in a shooting by a 19-year-old at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. The 3-0 ruling from the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals comes as age-based restrictions are shaping up to become a flashpoint in the legal battles over gun access since the Supreme Court last year laid out a new test for determining a gun restriction’s constitutionality. But the ruling may also be short-lived after Republican lawmakers in Florida this week introduced a bill that would lower the minimum age required to buy a firearm in the state from 21 back to 18.BREAKFAST BROWSEJimmy Fallon pranks judges on ‘The Voice’The comedian shocked the judges with an unexpected performance of Michael McDonald’s “I Keep Forgettin’.” Watch the video here.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping takes his oath while securing a historic third term as president, during a ceremonial vote in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Friday.Mark R. Cristino/ReutersHong KongCNN      Xi Jinping’s unprecedented third term as China’s president was officially endorsed by the country’s political elite on Friday, solidifying his control and making him the longest-serving head of state of Communist China since its founding in 1949.  Xi was reappointed Friday as president for another five years by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in a ceremonial vote in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People – a highly choreographed exercise in political theater meant to demonstrate the legitimacy and unity of the ruling elite.  He received a unanimous 2,952 votes followed by a standing ovation.   The reappointment of Xi, China’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, was largely seen as a formality, after the 69-year-old secured a norm-shattering third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party last fall.  In China, the presidency – or “state chairman” in Chinese – is a largely ceremonial title. Real power resides in the positions of head of the party and military, two key roles that Xi also holds and was reappointed to at a key Communist Party congress in October.  Nevertheless, his reappointment as head of state officially completes his transition into a second decade in power.   And it comes amid a broader reshuffle of leadership roles in the central government, or the State Council, and other state organizations that further increases Xi’s already firm grasp on the levers of power.  Li Qiang, one of Xi’s most trusted protégés, is expected to be chosen China’s premier on Saturday.   Traditionally, the premiership is an influential role in charge of the economy, although over the past decade, its power has been severely eroded by Xi, who has taken almost all decision-making into his own hands.   On Friday, the National People’s Congress (NPC) also appointed other key state leaders, including Zhao Leji as the body’s head and Han Zheng as the country’s vice-president.  The newly appointed leaders all took a public oath of allegiance to the Chinese constitution inside the Great Hall of the People.  The NPC also approved a sweeping plan to reform institutions under the State Council, including the formation of a financial regulatory body and national data bureau and a revamp of its science and technology ministry.  The overhaul is seen as a further step by Xi to strengthen Communist Party control over key areas of policymaking.Challenges aheadWhile Xi has secured a firm grip on power, he faces a myriad of challenges both at home and abroad.  The Chinese economy is struggling to recover from three years of harsh zero-Covid restrictions, investor confidence is waning, and a demographic crisis is looming as the country registered its first population decline in six decades.  China is also facing a series of diplomatic headwinds from Washington and other Western capitals, as relations plummeted in recent years over Beijing’s human rights record, military build-up, handling of Covid and growing partnership with Russia.  In unusually direct remarks Monday, Xi accused the US of leading a campaign to suppress China and causing its serious domestic woes.  “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,” Xi told a group of government advisers representing private businesses on the sidelines of the NPC meeting.  On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Xi on his extended term, according to Russian state media.   “I am confident that working together, we will ensure the further growth of fruitful Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields,” Putin said.  Putin also noted that Russia highly appreciated Xi’s personal contribution “to strengthening relations of comprehensive cooperation and strategic interaction” between Moscow and Beijing, TASS said.Xi has now entered new historical territory. No Chinese leader had held the title of head of state for more than 10 years, including Communist China’s founding father, Chairman Mao Zedong.   Liu Shaoqi, who took over as state chairman from Mao in 1959, was sacked in 1968 and persecuted to death a year later during Mao’s tumultuous Cultural Revolution.  After Mao’s death, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping introduced presidential term limits in China’s constitution in 1982 to avoid the kind of chaos and catastrophe seen under Mao’s life-long rule.   Deng also led institutional reforms to bring a greater separation of positions and functions between the party and the state.  However, those efforts have been severely undermined by Xi, who greatly expanded the party’s hold on power – and his own grip over the party.  In 2018, China’s legislature abolished presidential term limits in a ceremonial vote, effectively allowing Xi to rule for life.    CNN’s Sandi Sidhu contributed to this report.

London fears for its future as companies defect to Wall Street    			By Hanna Ziady, CNN		  Updated  7:20 AM EST, Fri March 10, 2023    Link Copied!   A FTSE share index board in the atrium of the London Stock Exchange Group's offices in London, UK, on Friday, August 12, 2022.Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesLondonCNN      London is used to punching well above its weight in global financial markets.   For years, the London Stock Exchange attracted an outsized share of investor capital relative to the size of the UK economy, reflecting the international nature of its listed companies.  In 2000, UK-listed equities made up 11% of the MSCI World Index — which tracks more than 1,500 companies that account for the vast majority of the global stock market by value — according to Citigroup. Fast-forward 23 years and the UK market now represents just 4%, the bank’s chief global equity strategist wrote in the Financial Times.  Investors have been drawn to faster-growing markets in other parts of the world, such as China and India, and to big tech IPOs on Wall Street. Meanwhile, UK pensions funds have slashed their exposure to local stocks in the search of more certain returns on government bonds.  Then came Brexit and years of political turmoil that undermined London’s status as the king of European finance, and battered Britain’s standing in the eyes of investors.  The combined effect has weighed heavily on the FTSE 100    (UKX), which, despite a recent hot streak, has trailed the gains in benchmark exchanges in the European Union and the United States since the global financial crisis.    A general view of the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England in London, UK, on February 2, 2023. Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThese stocks have been shunned for years. Now investors love themFears for London’s future resurfaced over the past week after chipmaker ARM, the crown jewel of the UK tech sector, said it would hold its IPO on Wall Street, and CRH    (CRH), the world’s largest building materials supplier, said it would moving its primary listing to the United States. Shell, London’s largest listed company, has also reportedly considered relocating. The health of London’s markets is vital to the UK economy, hence the growing sense of alarm.  Taken together, the company moves feel like “a vote of no confidence in the investment environment here in the UK,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at stockbroker CMC Markets UK.   London is still a major international financial center. Some $3.8 trillion of daily foreign exchange trades are transacted there — more than in New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo combined. And 70% of global secondary bond market trading happens in the city, according to the London Stock Exchange.   Outside of the United States and China, London also raised the most money, through IPOs and follow-on deals, in 2021. And Britain remained the world’s leading exporter of financial services that year.  Still, there is plenty of evidence that London can’t be complacent about its future. France is now home to Europe’s largest stock market by value — its CAC All-Share Index is worth €3.1 trillion ($3.3 trillion), compared with London’s FTSE All-Share index at £2.4 trillion ($2.9 trillion).  ARM’s headquarters and operations will remain in Britain and the company, owned by Japan’s Softbank, said it intended to consider a subsequent UK listing “in due course.”   Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right, shake hands after a press conference at Windsor Guildhall, Windsor, England, Monday Feb. 27, 2023. The U.K. and the European Union ended years of wrangling and acrimony on Monday, sealing a deal to resolve their thorny post-Brexit trade dispute over Northern Ireland. Dan Kitwood/Pool/APBrexit slammed the UK economy. The new Northern Ireland deal gives it hopeBut its decision to list in New York is clearly part of a trend. Ferguson    (FERGY), a UK-based plumbing equipment supplier, moved its primary listing from London to New York last year. Software group WANdisco and online sports betting company Flutter    (PDYPF), which owns FanDuel, are also exploring US listings, in addition to their UK listings. Flutter    (PDYPF) said it believed a US listing would provide “access to much deeper capital markets, and to new US domestic investors.”  The value gap between the two markets is stark. The MSCI United Kingdom Index, which tracks 80 of the biggest UK-listed companies, now trades at a nearly 40% discount to the 625-strong US MSCI Index, according to researchers at Citi.   The steady erosion of London’s position as a financial center has prompted the UK government and regulators to embark on a program of reforms designed to reboot UK finance.   Dubbed the “Edinburgh Reforms,” they amount to the most significant overhaul of Britain’s financial services policy in two decades and span banking, asset management, insurance and capital markets.   The ARM decision “demonstrates the need for the UK to make rapid progress in its regulatory and market reform agenda,” London Stock Exchange CEO Julia Hoggett said in a statement.   “We are working with regulators, government and wider market participants to ensure UK capital markets provide the best possible funding environment for UK and global companies.”Fighting for its futureLondon’s markets matter a great deal to the wider UK economy.   They are integral to Britain’s sprawling financial services sector, which contributes more than 8% to UK GDP and is the source of roughly 10% of tax revenue, according to PwC.   More than 1 million people work in the industry, with another 1.2 million people employed in related professional services, such as law, auditing and public relations.  Beyond the jobs they create and the tax they generate, financial markets also channel capital into companies to fund future growth.   The loss of ARM — which was a constituent of the FTSE 100 before it was bought by Softbank in 2016 — suggests that without a more vibrant stock market, Britain risks losing the best of its homegrown companies to the United States. The bigger worry is that where listings go, jobs and investment inevitably follow.  In other words, to safeguard its future, London needs to reinvigorate its stock markets.  The city needs to be seen as the place to be for businesses wanting to grow and raise capital, said Alasdair Haynes, the CEO of Aquis Exchange, an upstart rival to the London Stock Exchange and the CBOE.  “We’re brilliant at start-up capital… When it comes to scale-up capital, we are absolutely rubbish,” Haynes told CNN.  The key is to change regulation to make it easier for smaller companies to list and for the public to invest in them ahead of an IPO. “It doesn’t mean lowering standards. It means rules should be proportionate and appropriate for the size of a business,” Haynes said.  London has plenty of potential. It is home to 100 tech “unicorns” — companies valued at more than $1 billion, says the City of London Corporation. That’s more than in the rest of Europe combined. It is also the third biggest fintech hub in the world.   Those “unicorns” should be listing in London “at an earlier stage,” Haynes argues, “rather than growing through private equity and being sold off to Nasdaq.”  Hoggett of the London Stock Exchange puts it this way: “London needs to be young, scrappy and hungry.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Camp toy store pleads for help after Silicon Valley Bank collapse    Mar 11, 2023  Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •VideoSNL’s take on the Oscars Preshow    Mar 12, 2023  •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, introduced legislation that would block tax credits for electric vehicle batteries produced using Chinese technology, saying it would “significantly restrict the eligibility of IRA tax credits and prevent Chinese companies from benefiting.”  Ford said in response to Rubio that “making those batteries here at home is much better than continuing to rely exclusively on foreign imports, like other auto companies do. A wholly owned Ford subsidiary alone will build, own and operate this plant. No other entity will get US tax dollars for this project.”  Last month, Rubio asked the Biden administration to review Ford’s deal to use technology from CATL.  Rubio called for an immediate Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review of the licensing agreement between Ford and CATL.  Rubio said the deal “will only deepen US reliance on the Chinese Communist Party for battery tech, and is likely designed to make the factory eligible for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits.”  CFIUS is a US Treasury-led interagency panel that reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security.  Treasury declined to comment, but Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said last month the Ford deal will “bringing advanced manufacturing capabilities from overseas to the United States is key to our competitiveness, will stimulate our economy, and create good-paying American jobs.”  Ford has said the plant would create 2,500 jobs and begin producing lower cost and faster recharging lithium-iron-phosphate batteries in 2026.  The $430 billion IRA imposes restrictions on battery sourcing and is designed to wean the United States off the Chinese supply chain for electric vehicles (EVs). The IRA will eventually bar credits if any EV battery components were manufactured by a “foreign entity of concern,” in a provision aimed at China.

Chinese troops attend the opening ceremony of the 'Peace Mission 2021' joint counter-terrorism military exercise held in Russia in September 2021.Li Chun/China News Service/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      Chinese state-owned defense firms have maintained trade relationships with sanctioned Russian defense companies during the past year, even as many of the world’s leading economies cut ties with Moscow and the companies driving its continued assault on Ukraine.     Customs records reviewed by CNN show key companies within both countries’ vast military-industrial complexes have continued their years-long relationships, despite the horror Moscow has unleashed in Europe.   putin firma ley suspension new start lkl jose levy_00015214.pngvideo    Putin says Russia's economy is strong. Biden disagrees. Here's the realityRecords show that throughout 2022, through at least mid-November, Beijing-based defense contractor Poly Technologies sent at least a dozen shipments – including helicopter parts and air-to-ground radio equipment – to a state-backed Russian firm sanctioned by the US for its connection to leader Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.   Poly Technology’s long-term trade partner – Ulan Ude Aviation Plant, a purveyor of military-grade helicopters – also continued to send parts and several helicopters to the Beijing-based company last year, trade data show.   Most of the helicopter parts included in the shipments to Russia were labeled for use in the multipurpose Mi-171E helicopter, designed for transport and search and rescue. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China began importing this model of chopper from Russia more than 10 years ago.    Three shipments from Poly Technologies were labeled as including products for the operation or service of the Russian-made Mi-171SH, a military transport helicopter that can be equipped with weapons and has been used in Moscow’s operations in Ukraine.    There is no evidence that any of the goods exchanged are directly feeding Russia’s war.  CNNvideo    National security adviser warns China about sending weapons to RussiaThe customs records came from two data sets. The first was provided by trade data firm Import Genius, whose information is collated by secondary sources from official Russian customs and shipment records.    Washington-based think tank C4ADS, which collates official customs records aggregated from multiple third-party providers, provided the second set.    CNN has not independently verified the data, which may provide a partial but not complete picture of the trade.   Military and security experts say the parts sent from the Chinese firm to Russia are fairly basic equipment for Russian-designed aircraft that could be part of existing contracts and standard business relationships between the companies.    But last year’s trade underscores enduring ties between key players in the state-backed defense sectors on both sides – relationships that had strengthened over the past decade as Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping developed their strategic alignment.    Experts say such well-established networks could be leveraged if Beijing were to provide direct, lethal aid for the Kremlin’s war effort.    Western leaders in recent weeks have warned China is considering that step. Beijing has denied this, derided the warning as a “smear,” and repeatedly defended its “normal” trade with Russia and rejected what it calls “unilateral” sanctions against Moscow.

Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    Evolving partnership Beijing and Moscow’s military ties have evolved dramatically since the height of the Cold War – a period marked by mutual hostility and ideological divergence.    While some frictions remain, the two authoritarian neighbors have grown close, especially under Putin and Xi, who together declared a “no limits” partnership just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.   That includes a growing security relationship.   Following the fall of the Soviet Union, a robust, but decidedly one-way weapons trade flourished in which Russia marketed its superior weaponry to China.   More recently, the rapid modernization of China’s military has begun to shift that dynamic.   In 2021, Putin boasted that the two countries were “developing together certain high-tech types of weapons,” according to Russian state media, and lauded their joint military exercises – which have also expanded in scope and geographic range.

Those are being integrated into an “an increasingly sophisticated supply chain,” according to Alex Gabuev, a senior fellow at the international think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.     Then came the Ukraine war.    So far, China has stepped carefully around sweeping Western penalties targeting those supporting Russia – although 10 Chinese companies have been hit by US restrictions related to the war.    But a major question for Western officials is whether existing defense relationships could be used by China to supply lethal aid for the Kremlin’s war effort, which is widely believed to be running low on ammunition and arms.   Last month CNN reported that US intelligence officials believe the Chinese government is considering sending drones and ammunition to Russia.   On March 7, China’s new foreign minister Qin Gang said that China “has not provided weapons to either side” of Russia’s war, and denounced US concerns in the matter as hypocritical.    Observers of Chinese foreign affairs say its leaders are well aware of the reputational and economic damage if it is perceived to be backing Moscow militarily – and many are skeptical Beijing would take such a step to aid a nuclear-armed Russia at this time.   “Russia is losing this war in general terms … but it’s not a loss that would lead to Putin’s demise and democratization of Russia, so I don’t see reasons for China now to do more than they are doing,” said Gabuev.

China is also not alone in continuing procurement from a Russia at war.   When asked by CNN about the shipments from China to sanctioned Russian firms, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was “unaware of the situation,” and that China “stand(s) firmly on the side of dialogue and peace.”    The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.    But on February 27 its spokesman said Russia saw “no need to comment further” on claims that Russia asked China for military equipment which he said had already been refuted by Beijing.

China Poly Group did not respond to a request for comment.  The company’s trade partner Ulan Ude Aviation Plant, a subsidiary of top state-owned manufacturer Russian Helicopters, which makes the widely used Mi-8/17 series helicopters long integral to Russian military transport, also did not respond to a request for comment.   Two other key companies appear in the customs data – China’s AVIC International Holding, controlled by state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, and Russia’s United Engine Corporation (UEC), which is part of state-owned defense giant Rostec.   Their trade involved Russian-designed jet engine parts, many of which were labeled for an engine used in Chinese fighter jets.    Shipments from AVIC International to UEC made through July last year were listed as contractual obligations under warranty, and export records show UEC shipping parts for the same engine model to China including as recently as December, according to data from Import Genius.   AVIC International and UEC did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously referenced shipments made from Poly Technologies and AVIC International Holding to Russian partners.

But China may not be too concerned about the transactions shown in the trade data reviewed by CNN, according to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.    “This type of export has to be approved by the government. But given the nature of these parts and the fact that (Poly Technologies) has been under US sanction since 2013, the government may not see the need not to approve,” she said.

Sun said it was no surprise Russia would continue fulfilling contracts for Chinese-purchased equipment, but warned goods going the opposite direction could be “reimported by Russia to supply their war attrition.”   It’s also unlikely that the full picture will ever be revealed.   “Neither China nor Russia wants Western intelligence to be aware of the depth and breadth of their strategic alignment,” said Alexander Korolev, a senior lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales in Australia.   If China were to supply lethal aid, Korolev added, “everything would be done to cover this up.”   “And one way to cover it up is to make it look as if it’s just a part of regular, long-term military technical cooperation – rather than a response to the war.”     CNN’s Beijing bureau and Josh Pennington contributed reporting.

President Joe Biden says his budget will reduce deficits by nearly $3 trillion over a decade.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesCNN      President Joe Biden released his annual budget Thursday, outlining his policy priorities for the year ahead.  Make no mistake, the proposed budget has no chance of making it through the Republican-controlled House. But Biden’s plan will frame upcoming political battles on Capitol Hill, where the GOP has yet to unveil its own spending plan.   Biden’s budget comes out after the US hit the debt ceiling, a cap set by Congress, earlier this year. The Treasury Department is now taking extraordinary measures to allow the government to keep paying its bills. But the country could start to default on its obligations over the summer if Congress doesn’t address the debt ceiling before then. Republicans are calling for some spending cuts in exchange for voting to raise the cap, while the White House does not want to negotiate on resolving the debt limit drama.  Interactive: The $31.4 trillion debt dilemmaMany of the provisions in the budget rehash the president’s earlier proposals to expand the social safety net and to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations. He wants to restore the expanded child tax credit and make permanent enhanced Obamacare subsidies, both enacted in the American Rescue Plan in 2021. And he wants to provide universal free preschool, make college more affordable and establish a national paid family and medical leave program, which did not make it into prior packages when the Democrats controlled Congress over the past two years.  Biden’s spending plan also calls for shoring up Medicare and capping the price of insulin for all Americans.  The administration says these proposed policies will result in a nearly $3 trillion reduction in the deficits – the difference between what the government spends and its revenue – over the next decade. Here’s what’s in Biden’s budget proposalPlace a minimum tax on billionaires: The budget includes a 25% minimum tax on all the income of the wealthiest .01% of Americans, including their appreciated assets. It would hit those with a net worth of more than $100 million. Prior efforts to add this type of tax were not successful.  Increase the corporate tax rate: Biden wants to increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate set by the GOP tax cut package in 2017. The budget would also reduce incentives for multinational businesses to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and raise the tax rate on their foreign earnings to 21% from 10.5%. And it would hike the stock buybacks tax enacted last year to 4%, from 1%.  Repealing Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy: Biden’s budget would scrap some tax cuts for certain individuals that were put in place by the Republican’s 2017 tax law.   Biden’s plan would raise the top tax rate to 39.6% from 37%. This would impact single filers making more than $400,000 a year and married couples making more than $450,000 per year, according to the administration.   It also proposes taxing capital gains at the same rate as wage income for those earning more than $1 million, as well as closing the carried interest loophole that allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains – thus lowering their tax rate.  The Biden administration has previously had trouble getting support for these provisions from some Democrats.   Restore the enhanced child tax credit: The budget calls for reviving the expanded child tax credit, which was in place for 2021. It would beef up the credit to $3,600 per child for those under age 6 and $3,000 for older children. It would permanently make the credit fully refundable so more low-income families would qualify.   Improve Medicare’s finances: Biden wants to shore up Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund, known as Part A, by raising taxes on those earning more than $400,000 a year and by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for even more drugs.  Medicare, which covers more than 65 million senior citizens and people with disabilities, will only be able to fully pay scheduled benefits until 2028, according to the most recent forecast by its trustees. Biden’s proposal would extend Medicare’s solvency by 25 years or more, according to the White House.  The plan would increase the net investment income tax rate on earned and unearned income above $400,000 to 5%, up from 3.8%. Also, it would be levied on the owners of certain pass-through firms who include business income on their personal tax returns and aren’t currently subject to the tax.  In addition, the measure would dedicate the revenue from the tax, which was created by the Affordable Care Act, to Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund.  Also, the proposal would build on the Inflation Reduction Act, which congressional Democrats passed last summer, by allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation sooner after they launch. And it would extend the law’s requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation to commercial health insurance.  $35 insulin for all Americans: The budget also calls for capping the price of insulin at $35 a month for everyone. The Inflation Reduction Act limited the price of each insulin prescription to $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries as of this year.  Democrats had hoped to extend the provision to those with private insurance as part of last year’s package, but congressional Republicans blocked the measure.  Reduce prescription drug costs for seniors: The budget proposes to limit Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket costs for generic drugs used for certain chronic conditions to no more than $2. Seniors’ costs would also drop if Medicare expanded its drug price negotiations.  Make enhanced Obamacare subsidies permanent: Biden wants to continue the more generous Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire after 2025. The temporary enhancement has beefed up the premium subsidy and allowed more middle-class folks to qualify. The proposal would also provide Medicaid-like coverage to those in states that have not expanded the public health insurance program for low-income Americans.  Increase food security: The budget would provide more than $15 billion to allow more states and schools to provide free school meals to an additional 9 million children.  Reduce maternal mortality: Biden would provide $471 million to reduce maternal mortality rates and expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities. It would also require all states to provide continuous Medicaid postpartum coverage for 12 months, instead of 60 days.  Lower Medicaid spending: The budget would require private insurance companies that provide Medicaid coverage to pay back some money when they charge the program far more than they actually spend on patient care. And it would give the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate additional, supplemental Medicaid drug rebates on behalf of states.  Make college more affordable: The spending plan calls for a $500 increase to the maximum Pell grant, which is awarded to roughly 7 million college students from the lowest-income families annually. Currently, the maximum Pell grant is $7,395 for the 2023-2024 school year. Congress has increased the maximum amount by $900 over the past two years, but the grant historically covered a larger share of the cost of college than it does now.   Biden’s budget would also provide $500 million for a new grant program to help make two years of community college free. And it asks Congress for a $620 million increase in funding for the Office of Federal Student Aid, which processes financial aid forms and helps service student loans. The office did not receive a funding increase this year, despite likely having to support borrowers with restarting payment this summer after a three-year pause.  Universal preschool and affordable child care: The budget would provide funding for a new federal-state partnership program that would provide universal, free preschool. The spending plan would also increase funding for existing federal early care and education programs.   Provide paid family and medical leave: Biden’s budget would establish a national paid family and medical leave program. It would provide 12 weeks of leave for eligible employees to take time off to care for and bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill loved one, heal from their own serious illness, address circumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment, or find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, according to the administration.  Congress provided for some paid sick leave during the Covid-19 pandemic, but lawmakers let the benefit expire in 2021.Address climate change: The spending plan calls for billions of dollars of investment to help address climate change.   For example, money would go toward creating clean-energy jobs and cutting energy bills for families, funding climate research and helping communities become strengthen their infrastructure to withstand floods, wildfires, storms and drought brought on by climate change.  The investments would also help achieve Biden’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% by 2030.  Military defense and support for Ukraine: The proposed budget would provide the US Department of Defense with a 3.2% increase in funding over this year’s level, with an emphasis on countering China and assisting Ukraine.   It would also deliver more than $6 billion, through both the Departments of Defense and State, to Ukraine and other European allies to help fight against Russian aggression.

Victoria Gray is pictured here at the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing in London on Monday. The Royal SocietySign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.LondonCNN      For most of her life, Victoria Gray, a 37-year-old mother of four from Mississippi, had experienced excruciating bouts of pain.   Born with the blood disorder sickle cell disease, lengthy hospital stays and debilitating fatigue disrupted her childhood, forcing her to quit pursuing a college nursing degree and take potent and addictive painkillers.  “The pain I would feel in my body was like being struck by lightning and hit by a freight train all at once,” she said this week at the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing in London.  In 2019, she received an experimental treatment for the inherited disease that used the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, which allowed doctors to make very precise changes to her DNA. While the procedure itself was grueling and took seven to eight months to fully recover from, she said it has transformed her life.  “The feeling is amazing. I really feel that I’m cured now,” Gray said. “Because I no longer have to face the battles that I faced on a day-to-day (basis). I came from having to have an in-home caregiver to help me take baths, clean my house and care for my children. Now I do all those things on my own.”   She’s now able to enjoy a life she once felt was passing her by. She holds down a full-time job as a Walmart cashier, and she’s able to attend her children’s football games and cheerleading events and enjoy family outings. “The life I felt I was just existing in I’m now thriving in,” she said.  Gray shared her experience with doctors, scientists, patient advocates and bioethicists who gathered in London for the human genome editing summit, at which participants reported on advances made in the field and debated the thorny ethical issues posed by the cutting-edge technology.    “I’m here really to be a light because there’s mixed feelings about gene editing. And I think people can see the positive result of it. You know that a person who was once suffering in life, was miserable, now is able to be a part of life and enjoy it,” Gray told CNN.   He Jiankui presents a slide during a speech at the 2018 international summit on human genome editing in Hong Kong, China.Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Baby scandal lingersGray’s uplifting story, which received a standing ovation from the audience, stood in contrast to a presentation made the last time the conference was held, in Hong Kong in 2018, when Chinese doctor He Jiankui stunned his peers and the world with the revelation that he had created the world’s first gene-edited babies.   The two girls grew from embryos He had modified using CRISPR-Cas9, which he said would make them resistant to HIV. His work was widely condemned by the scientific community, which decried the experiment as medically unnecessary and ethically irresponsible. He received a three-year jail sentence in 2019. Questions about the baby scandal still linger more than four years later, and after being recently released from prison, He is reportedly seeking to continue his work. China has tightened its regulation of experimental biomedical research since 2018, but it hasn’t gone far enough, said Joy Zhang, a medical sociologist at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom.   “Ethical governance in practice is still confined to traditional medical, scientific, as well as educational, establishments. The new measures fail to directly address how privately funded research and other … ventures will be monitored,” Zhang said at the conference.  Ethically questionable experimental research isn’t an issue confined to China, said Robin Lovell-Badge, head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who chaired the 2018 Hong Kong conference session in which He attempted to defend his work.    “(He Jiankui) is not the only concern in this area. One of our big concerns I always have is the possibility that there will be rogue companies, rogue scientists setting up to do genome editing in an inappropriate way,” Lovell-Badge said on Monday at the conference.   Gray shared her story at Monday's conference.The Royal Society    Hopes and fears around gene editingWhile the CRISPR baby scandal tarnished the technology’s reputation, CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques have made a major impact on biomedical research,  and two scientists behind the tool — Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna — won a Nobel prize for their work in 2020. “Clinical trial results demonstrate that CRISPR is safe, and it’s effective for treating and curing human disease — an extraordinary advance given the technology is only 10 years old,” Doudna said at the conference in a video address. “It’s important with a powerful technology like this to grapple with the challenges of responsible use.”  In addition to the sickle cell trial that includes Gray, clinical trials are also underway to test the safety of gene editing in treating several other conditions, including a related blood disorder called beta thalassemia; leber congenital amaurosis, which is a form of inherited childhood blindness; blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma; type 1 diabetes; and HIV/AIDS.  DNA acts as a instruction manual for life on our planet, and CRISPR-Cas9 can target sites in plant and animal cells using guide RNA to get the Cas-9 enzyme to a more precise spot on a strand of DNA. This allows scientists to change DNA by knocking out a particular gene or inserting new genetic material at a predetermined site in the strand.   People with sickle cell disease have abnormal hemoglobin in red blood cells that can cause them to get hard and sticky, clogging blood flow in small vessels.   In the trial that Gray was part of, doctors increased the production of a different kind of hemoglobin, known as fetal hemoglobin, which makes it harder for cells to sickle and stick together. The process is invasive and involves removing premature cells from the bone marrow and modifying them — by using CRISPR-Cas9 in the lab — to eventually produce fetal hemoglobin. The patient has to undergo a round of chemotherapy before receiving the gene-edited cells to ensure the body doesn’t reject them.  The conference also shed light on new, more sophisticated gene-editing techniques, such as prime editing and base editing, which recently was used to modify immune cells and successfully treat a teen with treatment-resistant leukemia. These next generation techniques will allow humans “to have some say in the sequence of our genomes so we are no longer so beholden to the misspellings in our DNA,” said David Liu, the Richard Merkin professor and director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies in Healthcare at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University.  The gene therapy trials currently underway involve treating people who were born with a certain disease or condition by altering non-reproductive cells in what’s known as somatic gene editing.  The next frontier — many would say red line — is heritable gene editing: altering the genetic material in human sperm, eggs or embryos so that it can be safely passed onto the next generation. The goal would be to prevent babies from inheriting genetic diseases.  A researcher handles a petri dish while observing a CRISPR/Cas9 process through a stereomicroscope at the Max-Delbrueck-Centre for Molecular Medicine in 2018.Gregor Fischer/picture alliance/Getty Images“It’s a very different set of ethical trade-offs when you’re not a treating disease in an existing individual but you’re in fact preventing an individual yet to be born from suffering from a disease. That’s a very different set of considerations,” said George Daley, Caroline Shields Walker Professor of Medicine and dean of the faculty of medicine at Harvard Medical School.  In a statement released at the end of the conference, the organizers said “heritable human genome editing remains unacceptable at this time.”  They added that public discussion and policy debates should continue and were important for resolving whether this technology should be used. CRISPR access and equityThe hope offered by gene therapy is creating fresh ethical storms — primarily over who gets access to such treatments. The therapy Gray received, which is expected to soon receive regulatory approval, is likely to cost more than $2 million per person, putting it out of reach for many who need it in the United States and in low-income countries.   “If we want to be serious about equitable access to these kinds of therapies, we have to start talking early on about ways to develop them and make them available and make them cost effective and sustainable,” said Alta Charo, the Warren P. Knowles Professor Emerita of Law and Bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.   Researchers want to develop CRISPR therapies that can be delivered though an injection rather than the  chemotherapy and invasive bone marrow transplant Gray went through.   Worldwide, more than 300,000 children are born with sickle cell disease every year, over 75% of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, where screening programs and treatment options are limited. Even relatively affordable drugs to treat sickle cell disease, such as hydroxyurea, don’t reach everyone who needs them in India, said Gautam Dongre, the secretary of the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Organizations in India and father of two children with sickle cell disease.  “After 40 years if these drugs aren’t reachable for the common people, then what about gene therapy?” Dongre asked at the conference.  Julie Makani, an associate professor in the department of haematology and blood transfusion at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences in Tanzania, said more genomic research should take place in Africa.   “The ultimate thing for me, particularly as a physician scientist, is not just discovery, but also seeing the application of knowledge…into (an) improvement in health,” Makani said.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesCNN      The US and its allies have blocked or seized more than $58 billion worth of assets owned or controlled by sanctioned Russians in the past year as Western governments continue to dial up the pressure over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint statement from a multinational sanctions enforcement task force.   The Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force held its sixth multilateral deputies meeting Thursday morning to discuss the group’s continued work and pledge to “redouble” their efforts to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates. The task force is a joint effort between the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, the UK and the European Commission.   “REPO will redouble efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unjust war, countering Russian efforts to undermine, circumvent, or evade REPO’s collective sanctions,” according to a joint statement released following the meeting and obtained first by CNN.   “As Russia’s war of aggression continues, REPO members remain determined in their commitment to impose steep costs on Russia.  REPO will continue to identify, locate, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russians, with the aim of depriving the Kremlin of the funds it needs to fight its illegal war,” it continues.   The task force, which was formed last March, is also taking further steps to crack down on sanctions evasion as the US and its allies work to seal the cracks in a sanctions regime that has weakened but not crippled the Russian economy.   Following Thursday’s meeting, REPO also issued a joint global advisory to help the private sector spot and prevent common sanctions evasion methods, like using family members to maintain access to sanctioned assets, creating complex ownership structures and using third party jurisdictions and false trade information to ship controlled goods, including those that support the Kremlin’s war machine.   “This advisory will contribute to effective sanctions implementation across REPO Task Force members’ jurisdictions by preventing the undermining of financial sanctions, export controls, and other restrictive measures designed and implemented in response to Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine,” the note says.   The US was represented Thursday by Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Marshall Miller, the principal associate deputy attorney general, according to a US Treasury Department official.  The task force has blocked financial assets and seized luxury yachts, high-end real estate and even priceless art, with US officials recovering a possible Fabergé egg from one Russian oligarch’s seized yacht last summer.  But while the task force has generated splashy headlines over the past year by seizing the yachts and homes of Russia’s ultra-rich, a US Treasury official told CNN that REPO provides the governments involved a valuable and streamlined mechanism to apply many of the same tools and best practices for the broader effort to crackdown on sanctions evasion.Over one year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden administration officials are focusing on how to plug the gaps on sanctions evasion, a problem that runs the gamut of adversaries like China and allies like Turkey, India and the United Arab Emirates.   “We will engage companies, banks, regulators, and service providers in a series of jurisdictions we assess are wittingly or unwittingly providing assistance to Russia. This is a broad campaign on which we are working closely with allies and partners,” Elizabeth Rosenberg, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, said last week at the Association of Women in International Trade.   The latest crackdown started in earnest in February on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when the Biden administration announced sanctions for “over 200 individuals and entities, including both Russian and third-country actors across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East that are supporting Russia’s war effort.” Those sanctions were imposed in partnership with the G7 and other allies.  Also on Thursday, the US issued a slew of sanctions against companies involved in a “shadow banking” network established to evade sanctions, as well as entities that are part of a separate China-based network to supply critical parts for Iran’s unmanned aerial vehicle program, which it exports to Russia for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  The US Treasury issued two sets of sanctions as part of its continued efforts to crack down on sanctions evasion networks and undermine efforts to support the Kremlin’s war machine and fund the Iranian regime as both countries forge closer ties.   The first set of sanctions targets 39 companies that make up a “significant ‘shadow banking’” system that helps sanctioned Iranian oil and gas companies access the international financial system and move billions of dollars, according to the Treasury.  The second set of sanctions issued today designate a network of five China-based companies and one employee who support Iran’s UAV procurement network and are responsible for the sale and shipment of “thousands of aerospace components,” according to the Treasury.

Win McNamee/Getty ImagesCNN      A sweeping cybersecurity breach of congressional members’ private information was more extensive than previously known and affects not only House lawmakers and their staff but also Senate employees.  The Senate sergeant-at-arms alerted Senate staff about the breach Thursday in an email obtained by CNN.  The compromised data is “extensive,” and includes sensitive data such as Social Security numbers, home addresses and information on Senate employees’ health insurance plans, the sergeant-at-arms said in the email, which urged Senate staff to freeze their family credit to guard against fraud.  Law enforcement gave the sergeant-at-arms a list of Senate employees whose data was stolen, the email said, and the sergeant-at-arms was contacting those employees so they could protect themselves from fraud.  Hundreds of US House members and staff also had their personally identifiable information stolen in the breach, which affected a DC health insurance service, CNN reported Wednesday.  Punchbowl News first reported on the sergeant-at-arms’ email.  The revelation that Senate staff also had their data stolen will only increase pressure from Capitol Hill on DC Health Link, the affected insurance service, to provide a full accounting of how the breach occurred.  DC Health Link said Wednesday it had “initiated a comprehensive investigation” of the incident and is working with law enforcement. The FBI is involved in the investigation, the bureau said.  It’s unclear how the data was accessed or who was responsible for the breach, but it immediately raised concerns among lawmakers that they could become the victims of identity theft, as many other Americans have in recent years.   House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have written a letter to DC Health Link expressing their concern over the breach, McCarthy previously told CNN.  Others were less alarmed.  “I can’t get all that worked up about this, honestly,” a Senate staffer told CNN Thursday night.  China “got all my data already in the OPM hack,” the staffer added, referring to the 2014-2015 breach of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised millions of US government personnel records. US officials have blamed Chinese hackers for the breach, a charge Beijing denied.   On a popular cybercrime forum this week, someone claimed to have sold the data belonging to DC Health Link. The advertisement for the stolen data, which CNN reviewed, claimed the leak affected 170,000 people and included Social Security numbers.  CNN was unable to independently verify those claims.

Ex-Goldman banker sentenced to 10 years prison in 1MDB corruption case    			By Reuters  Updated  7:02 PM EST, Thu March 9, 2023    Link Copied!   Ex-Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng and his lawyer Marc Agnifilo leave the federal court in New York, U.S., May 6, 2019.Jeenah Moon/ReutersFormer Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Thursday, after he was convicted of helping loot billions of dollars from Malaysia’s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund.  A jury in Brooklyn federal court last April found Ng, Goldman’s former head of investment banking in Malaysia, guilty of helping his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from the fund, launder the proceeds and bribe government officials to win business.  The charges stem from some $6.5 billion in bonds that Goldman helped 1MDB, which was founded to finance development projects in Malaysia, sell in 2012 and 2013.  U.S. prosecutors said $4.5 billion of that sum was embezzled by officials, bankers and their associates, in one of the biggest scandals in Wall Street history.  Funds were used to buy high-end real estate, jewelry and artwork, and finance the Hollywood film, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” according to the Department of Justice.  U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, who imposed the sentence, said Ng and his co-defendants “effectively stole money” meant for infrastructure and economic development projects to aid the Malaysian people.  “There is a critical need to deter crimes of pure greed like this one,” Brodie said.  The 1MDB scandal also rocked Malaysian politics. Former Prime Minister Najib Razak is serving a 12-year prison sentence after being convicted by a Malaysian court of receiving $10 million from a former 1MDB unit.  Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing.  In a filing last week, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn urged Brodie to sentence Ng to 15 years in prison, calling him a “deeply corrupt banker” and arguing a stiff sentence was necessary to dissuade other financial professionals from bribing officials to win business.  “Foreign corruption undermines the public’s confidence in international markets and institutions,” prosecutors wrote. “It destroys people’s faith in their leaders and it is deeply unfair to everybody else who plays by the rules.”  In his own sentencing request on Feb. 25, Ng asked that he be given no prison time and be allowed to return to Malaysia. He spent six months in a Malaysian prison before waiving his right to contest extradition to the United States in 2018.  Ng had pleaded not guilty and argued that $35 million in kickback payments he was accused of receiving was actually a return on an investment his wife had made.  Leissner had been Goldman’s Southeast Asia chief. He pleaded guilty and testified against Ng as part of a cooperation agreement. He has not yet been sentenced.  Jho Low, a Malaysian financier and suspected mastermind of the scheme, was indicted alongside Ng in 2018 but remains at large. Malaysian officials have said Low is in China, which Beijing denies.  In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay $2.9 billion and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge.

Read more opinion articles on CNN.CNN      In an attempt to weaken US diplomatic and military influence, Russian President Vladimir Putin has waged a propaganda war to convince other countries that the United States is engaging in a “purposeful, conscious US strategy to destabilize and make chaotic the situation in [Taiwan] and the world.”   Mary E. Lovely Peterson Institute for International EconomicsKatheryn RussPeterson Institute for International EconomicsChinese President Xi Jinping has lined up with Putin on that score, and the US military has warned that China’s parallel campaign of disinformation is intended to create “doubt amongst our allies and partners in the reliability of the United States.”  The Republican majority in the House would be doing Beijing and Moscow’s work for them if they refuse to raise the debt ceiling, sowing irreparable doubt among even our closest allies not just about US financial commitments, but about any promises we have made to other countries.  US Treasury bonds are IOUs to people who have lent the US money. Since the national debt hit its limit in January, the US Treasury has been taking extraordinary measures to cover these bond payments, but is quickly running out of options. If Congress doesn’t lift the debt ceiling, the US could default sometime between July and September, and possibly even sooner.   There are few things that undermine people’s confidence in a partner’s stability and goodwill more than getting stiffed. US bonds have been the world’s premier safe asset for decades, largely due to our reliable repayments, allowing us to borrow from domestic and overseas investors at highly favorable terms even at times of national crisis, such as the 2008 global financial crisis or the recent Covid-19 pandemic.  Even if the United States finds some way to “prioritize” paying allies first, defaulting on any of this debt would undermine the confidence of any country or investor who holds US bonds.    Moreover, our allies account for the majority of externally held US Treasuries. It’s a who’s who of our closest allies in the Pacific, including Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. Also among them are countries of key geostrategic importance in our competition with China, including India, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.   Together, these countries hold roughly $2 trillion in US Treasuries. Other key allies — Australia, Canada, France, Great Britain and Germany — hold more than $1 trillion in US Treasury securities. Stiffing them would irreparably undermine the trust essential to military and diplomatic coordination around the world, putting our national security at risk.  Defaulting on this debt would also weaken our greatest weapon in the new era of unconventional warfare: the ability to freeze large portions of rogue states’ economies through sanctions.

(Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)MANDEL NGAN/AFP/AFP via Getty ImagesOpinion: Hypocrisy to the max on debt ceilingUS sanctions are powerful because of the dominant position of the dollar in the global economy. Global markets price key commodities like oil in dollars, and international payments flow through a global banking system that depends on access to US dollars for transactions.     All of this is at risk if we default. Fear of not getting repaid on time makes US Treasury securities less attractive as a way to hold foreign reserves, reducing the global demand for dollars. This weakening of official dollar purchases would likely increase volatility in the dollar’s value against other currencies and decrease liquidity, prompting investors to reduce their holdings of dollars in any form.   Loss of confidence would filter into other transactions, including the use of the dollar to price contracts for cross-border loans or imports and exports.   In short, failure to raise the debt limit would weaken our national security because it is precisely the world’s trust and confidence that the United States government will pay its debts in full and on time that helps keep the dollar as the world’s dominant currency.  The danger of a US default goes well beyond global finance. Undermining trust in the US would set back any efforts to make our supply chains more secure and resilient. Stronger partnerships with Europe and countries in the Indo-Pacific are central to American efforts to reduce reliance on China for critical supplies.

The current weaponization of US debt obligations by House Republicans is rightly seen by our allies and foes as a major test of the credibility of all of America’s commitments.  As competition for economic alliances heats up around the globe, any congressional delay in raising the US debt limit plays directly into Xi’s and Putin’s hands. The responsible way to control growth in the national debt is by raising taxes and cutting spending in a process of budget negotiations based on good faith. That some in Congress are holding the debt limit hostage to bypass the hard work of budget negotiations creates a national security threat where none should exist.

Europe joins the US in its chip war with China    			By Juliana Liu and Wayne Chang, CNN		  Published  7:11 AM EST, Thu March 9, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackUS Amb. to Japan urges China to 'respect' other countries in the region    02:36   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      Europe’s biggest producer of advanced chipmaking technology has joined the United States in its escalating standoff with China.  The Netherlands announced Wednesday, via a letter from its trade minister to parliament, that new restrictions on overseas sales of semiconductor technology were needed to protect national security.  While the letter didn’t name ASML Holdings, Europe’s biggest tech firm, the curbs will affect the Dutch company, which is a key supplier to global chipmakers, including those in China.   The announcement marks the first public move by the Dutch government toward adopting rules, advocated by Washington, to restrict China’s chipmaking industry.   Japan has also been involved in three-way discussions with the Netherlands and the United States, a source familiar with the talks told CNN. Reuters reported that Tokyo is expected to issue an update on its policies on chip equipment exports as soon as this week.  Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, takes part in a deliberation with his fellow deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu Province, at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress NPC in Beijing, capital of China, March 5, 2023. Li Xueren/Xinhua/Getty ImagesXi Jinping hits out at US as he urges China's private firms to 'fight' alongside Communist PartyChina said Thursday it “firmly opposes” the Netherlands’ upcoming curbs, which come just months after the United States restricted sales of some semiconductor machinery to Beijing. For those measures to really bite, Washington needs other important suppliers, located in the Netherlands and Japan, to join.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning accused “certain countries” of “coercing and inducing other countries to take export restriction measures against China at the expense of their allies’ interests.”  She didn’t name the United States, but Chinese officials often use the term “certain countries” or “some countries” when making critical comments about Washington.  “We hope the Netherlands won’t follow some countries in abusing export control measures,” Mao said. “China will take all necessary countermeasures to protect our legitimate rights and interests.”  This week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping hit out at the United States with unusually direct comments as he called on China’s private companies to “fight” alongside the Communist Party at a time of mounting challenges. He accused Western countries led by the United States of trying to “contain” and “suppress” China.   Beijing has set a target for China to become a global leader in a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence, 5G wireless technology and quantum computing.Intensifying competitionIn October, those plans came up against a major obstacle when the Biden administration banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license. It also restricted the ability of American citizens to provide support for the development or production of chips at certain manufacturing facilities in China.  Chips are vital for everything from smartphones and self-driving cars to advanced computing and weapons manufacturing.

Customers such as TSMC, Samsung    (SSNLF) and China’s SMIC use the Dutch company’s equipment to mass-produce microchips.   “These new export controls focus on advanced chip manufacturing technology, including the most advanced deposition and immersion lithography tools,” ASML said in a statement. “Due to these upcoming regulations, ASML will need to apply for export licenses for shipment of the most advanced immersion … systems.”  It added that it didn’t expect the upcoming measures to have a material effect on its 2023 financial outlook. The company has mainly sold “mature” products to China.European battlegroundThe announcement of the Netherlands’ export restrictions, the details of which are expected to be confirmed before the summer, isn’t the first time the US-China tech rivalry spilled over into Europe.   Two European semiconductor deals ran into trouble last year over links with Beijing, in a sign of concern spreading in the West over potential Chinese control of critical infrastructure.

Both transactions were hit by national security concerns, and had involved acquisitions by Chinese-owned companies.  In the United Kingdom, Nexperia, a Dutch subsidiary of Shanghai-listed semiconductor maker Wingtech, was told by the government to sell at least 86% of its stake in Newport Wafer Fab, more than a year after taking control of the factory. Staffers have since protested the decision, saying it puts nearly 600 jobs at risk.  In Germany, the economic ministry barred Elmos Semiconductor, an automotive chipmaker, from selling its factory in the city of Dortmund to Silex, a Swedish subsidiary of China’s Sai Microelectronics.  The failed deals illustrate how, at a time of escalating US-China tensions, Europe is also under growing pressure to act, particularly as officials face US calls for key sectors to be kept out of Chinese control.  — CNN’s Laura He and Michelle Toh contributed to this report RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Camp toy store pleads for help after Silicon Valley Bank collapse    Mar 11, 2023  Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

The nation's newest and most advanced nuclear-powered attack submarine and the lead ship of its class, PCU Virginia returns to the General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard on July 30, 2004. General Dynamics Electric Boat/US NavyCNN      Australia plans to purchase at least four nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines from the United States, three sources familiar with the matter said, part of an emerging defense partnership widely viewed as a bid to counter China’s military ambitions in the Pacific.  Delivery of the submarines isn’t likely for years, potentially into the 2030s, but the expected announcement will act as a demonstration of progress by the AUKUS grouping, comprised of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese addressed the plan, which Reuters first reported, at a news event in Ahmedabad, India, on Wednesday.  While he did not provide details of the plan, he emphasized that his country will retain “absolute sovereignty” when it comes to control of nuclear-powered submarines acquired through the AUKUS partnership.   Asked by a journalist whether “Australia will retain full operational control of submarines, or could they be commanded by Americans,” Albanese said: “Australia will retain absolutely our sovereignty, our absolute sovereignty, 100%.”   The Virginia-class is the latest fast attack submarine in the Navy, intended to replace the aging fleet of Los Angeles-class submarines. Unlike the ballistic missile submarines, which are part of the US nuclear arsenal, fast attack submarines can employ a number of different weapons, including torpedoes and cruise missiles. The submarines can also carry special operations forces and carry out intelligence and reconnaissance missions.  Australia is also expected to work with the United Kingdom on developing a new class of nuclear-powered submarine, which could include US parts, the sources said, as the three countries move ahead with the defense partnership.  President Joe Biden will host the prime ministers of Australia and the United Kingdom in California next week to discuss the next steps in the partnership.  After announcing the AUKUS partnership in 2021, officials from the three countries have been working through plans to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, including legal issues in transferring classified technology and how to train Australian sailors on the submarines.  As part of the announcement, US submarines are likely to increase their visits to Australian ports in the coming years, before the eventual delivery of the new Australian submarines.  In purchasing US Virginia-class submarines while also developing submarines based on a British model, both the US and UK’s industrial bases will stand to benefit.  The AUKUS partnership is meant as a way to increase security in the Pacific region amid escalating tensions with China.  In San Diego on Monday, Biden is expected to discuss the plan with Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Both will be visiting the United States for the first time since assuming their roles. San Diego hosts a large US naval presence, including submarines, for the Pacific Fleet.  Negotiations have been ongoing for more than a year on the nuclear-powered submarines, which caused consternation when they were announced because it scuttled Australia’s plans to purchase conventional submarines from France.  Biden at the time called the rollout of the AUKUS submarine plan “clumsy.”  This story has been updated with additional information.   CNN’s Angus Watson contributed to this report.

Actor Donnie Yen walks to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, before the opening meeting of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on March 4, 2023.VCG/Visual China Group/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      A petition calling for the removal of martial arts star Donnie Yen as a presenter at this year’s Oscar ceremony due to his connections to China’s ruling Communist Party has garnered tens of thousands of signatures.   The 59-year-old actor, best known for his role in ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’ and the hugely popular ‘Ip Man’ franchise, has long been a controversial figure among sections within his native Hong Kong, owing to his apparent criticism of the city’s pro-democracy movement.  Describing Yen as a “supporter of the Chinese Communist regime,” the online petition points to several statements it claims ought to disqualify Yen from involvement in the 95th Academy Awards, which will be held on March 13.  One example listed was a profile published last week in GQ, in which Yen discussed the large and occasionally violent pro-democracy demonstrations that gripped Hong Kong throughout 2019.  “It wasn’t a protest, okay, it was a riot,” Yen told GQ of the demonstrations, which were ultimately suppressed by mass arrests and the introduction of a sweeping national security law by Beijing.  Hong Kong’s government and police, as well as authorities and state media in mainland China, also refer to the demonstrations as “riots,” a phrase pro-democracy supporters reject.  The petition claims Yen’s GQ remarks “not only violate the spirit of freedom of speech but also deny the rights of the people of Hong Kong to fight for their freedom and democracy.”   BEIJING, CHINA - JULY 24: People wear protective masks as they watch a movie in 3D at a theatre on the first day they were permitted to open on July 24, 2020 in Beijing, China.

Here's what changedThe Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied accusations the national security law has stifled  political opposition and criminalized dissent. Instead, it says the law has restored stability to the city after the tumult of the 2019 demonstrations.  The petition was created Saturday by “a group of people from Hong Kong,” according to the details provided, and has since gained more than 84,000 signatures.   “If the Oscars Committee continues to invite such a person as a guest presenter, it will damage the image and reputation of the film industry and cause serious harm to human rights and moral values,” the petition reads.  Last weekend, Yen was seen in attendance at a key Communist Party meeting in Beijing as part of an advisory body on arts and culture.   Speaking to press at the event, Yen said more Chinese action movies were needed to “become the pride of China” and “tell the story of China,” according to state-run Global Times.   The Oscars has not publicly commented on the petition. CNN has reached out to the Oscars for comment.  When contacted by CNN, Yen’s representative declined to provide a statement.  It’s not the first time Yen has attracted controversy among pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong. He was previously criticized after performing next to Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2017, an event Yen called a “great honor,” and for celebrating Hong Kong’s return “to motherland China” in 2020 on the anniversary of the city’s handover.   These incidents prompted many in Hong Kong to call for the boycotts of his recent films – “Ip Man 4” in 2019, and “Mulan” in 2020.  Yen seemed to acknowledge his critics in the GQ interview, saying: “A lot of people might not be happy for what I’m saying, but I’m speaking from my own experience.”  He is set to present the Oscars ceremony alongside other prominent actors and performers including Riz Ahmed, Emily Blunt, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson.

Video Ad Feedback'Impossible to intercept': This is Russia's new deadly weapon    02:42   - Source:CNNCNN      A Russian bomber fired three hypersonic missiles at the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Monday night, Ukrainian officials said, as part of a barrage that leveled a number of civilian targets including hotels and a shopping mall.   It is not the first time Moscow has deployed its Kinzhal hypersonic missile during its invasion, but it does appear to be a relatively rare occurrence.   Russia said it used Kinzhal missiles Ukraine in mid-March – a claim later confirmed by US officials to CNN – in the first known use of the weapon in combat.  In March, US President Joe Biden confirmed Russia’s use of the Kinzhal missile, describing it as “a consequential weapon … it’s almost impossible to stop it. There’s a reason they’re using it.”  Biden’s defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has downplayed the effectiveness of the missile, telling CBS in March that he “would not see it as a game-changer.”  And the UK defense ministry has previously said the Kinzhal missile is really just an air-launched version of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), which Russia has used repeatedly in its war on Ukraine.  Here’s what to know. Why the fear and hype about hypersonic missiles?First, it’s important to understand the term.   Essentially, all ballistic missiles are hypersonic – which means they travel at least five times the speed of sound. Almost any warhead released from a rocket miles in the atmosphere will reach this speed heading to its target. It is not a new technology.  What military powers – including Russia, China, the United States and North Korea – are working on now is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). An HGV is a highly maneuverable payload that can theoretically fly at hypersonic speed while adjusting course and altitude to fly under radar detection and around missile defenses.  An HGV is the weapon that’s almost impossible to stop. And Russia is thought to have an HGV in its arsenal, the Avangard system, which Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 called “practically invulnerable” to Western air defenses.  A Russian Air Force MiG-31K jet carries a high-precision hypersonic aero-ballistic missile Kh-47M2 Kinzhal during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia on May 9, 2018.Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP/FILEBut the Kinzhal, as a variant of the Iskander SRBM, is not an HGV. While it does have limited maneuverability like the Iskander, its main advantage is that it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions, according to a report last year from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  “The MiG-31K can strike from unpredictable directions and could avoid interception attempts altogether. The flying carrier vehicle might also be more survivable than the road-mobile Iskander system,” the report said.  The same report also noted that the ground-launched Iskander proved vulnerable to missile defense systems during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, during which Azeri forces intercepted an Armenian Iskander.  “This suggests that claims of the Kinzhal’s invulnerability to missile defense systems may also be somewhat exaggerated,” the report said.Does Ukraine have missile defenses?The United States and its NATO allies are already sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense.  According to a senior US official in March, these additional systems included the Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems.  NATO member Slovakia has also sent more modern S-300 missile defense batteries to Ukraine.   In April, the United Kingdom promised £100 million ($123 million) worth of high-grade military equipment, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. Weeks later, Germany said it would supply 50 anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine.   And the US is preparing a mammoth $40 billion aid package that would include additional anti-aircraft capabilities for the Ukrainian military. Why did Putin use the Kinzhal missile?Use in Ukraine marks the combat debut for Russia’s Kinzhal system.  “On March 18, the Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse of missiles and aviation ammunition of Ukrainian troops in the village of Delyatin, Ivano-Frankivsk region,” Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.  (220202) -- WASHINGTON, Feb. 2, 2022 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrives to attend a closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., the United States, on Feb. 2, 2022. The United States will deploy additional troops to Europe, the Defense Department announced Wednesday, citing tensions on Ukraine's borders. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua) (Photo by Xinhua/Sipa USA)Ting Shen/Xinhua/Sipa USAPentagon urges CEOs of largest defense companies to accelerate hypersonic weapons development as US lags behind ChinaUS officials later confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine and were able to track the launches in real time.  The launches in March were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message to the West about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN.  At that point, the war on the ground in Ukraine had become something of a stalemate. Russia may have been looking for victories it could tout.    The UK defense ministry said at the time that Moscow probably deployed the Kinzhal to “detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign.” Austin, the US defense secretary, used similar language in his CBS interview in March, saying Putin was”trying to reestablish some momentum.”  By the end of March, the US assessed that Russian forces were running low on air-launched cruise missiles, according to a US defense official, who said there were indications that Russia was trying to preserve that inventory as part of its declining stocks of precision guided munitions.    Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that virtually all ballistic missiles -- not missiles in general -- are hypersonic.  CNN’s Brad Lendon wrote and reported from Seoul.

Dutch to restrict semiconductor tech exports to China, joining US effort    			By Reuters  Published  8:49 PM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   The ASML Holding NV global headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, on Friday, October 14, 2022. Peter Boer/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileAmsterdam/WashingtonReuters      The Netherlands’ government on Wednesday said it plans new restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to protect national security, joining the US effort to curb chip exports to China.  The announcement marked the first concrete move by the Dutch, who oversee essential chipmaking technology, toward adopting rules urged by Washington to hobble China’s chipmaking industry and slow its military advances.  The US in October imposed sweeping export restrictions on shipments of American chipmaking tools to China, but for the restrictions to be effective it needs other key suppliers in the Netherlands and Japan, who produce key chipmaking technology, to agree. The allied countries have been in talks on the matter for months.  ASML Holding logo is seen at company's headquarters in Eindhoven, Netherlands, January 23, 2019.Eva Plevier/ReutersASML says 'rules are being finalized' on chip export controls to ChinaDutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher announced the decision in a letter to parliament, saying the restrictions will be introduced before the summer.  Her letter did not name China, a key Dutch trading partner, nor did it name ASML Holding    (ASML), Europe’s largest tech firm and a major supplier to semiconductor manufacturers, but both will be affected. It specified one technology that will be impacted is “DUV” lithography systems, the second-most advanced machines that ASML sells to computer chip manufacturers.  “Because the Netherlands considers it necessary on national security grounds to get this technology into oversight with the greatest of speed, the Cabinet will introduce a national control list,” the letter said.  A White House representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Commercial impactASML said in a response it expects to have to apply for licenses to export the most advanced segment among its DUV machines, but that would not impact its 2023 financial guidance.  ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, multimillion dollar machines that use powerful lasers to create the minute circuitry of computer chips.  The company expects sales in China to remain about flat at 2.2 billion euros in 2023, implying relative shrinkage as the company expects overall sales to grow by 25%. Major ASML customers such as TSMC and Intel    (INTC) are engaged in capacity expansions.  ASML has never sold its most advanced “EUV” machines to customers in China, and the bulk of its “DUV” sales in China go to relatively less advanced chipmakers. Its biggest South Korean customers, Samsung    (SSNLF) and SK Hynix both have significant manufacturing capacity in China.  The Dutch announcement leaves major questions unanswered, including whether ASML will be able to service the more than 8 billion euros worth of DUV machines it has sold to customers in China since 2014.  Schreinemacher said the Dutch government had decided on measures “as carefully and precisely as possible … to avoid unnecessary disruption of value chains.”  “It is for companies of importance to know what they are facing and to have time to adjust to new rules,” she wrote.  Japan is expected to issue an update on its chip equipment export policies as soon as this week.

Sign up here.Hong KongCNN      After three years of largely self-imposed isolation on the global stage, China is aiming to up its diplomatic offensive and win back lost ground – all while hardening its public stance toward its superpower rival, the United States.   Qin Gang, Beijing’s new foreign minister, on Tuesday declared that “China’s diplomacy has pressed the ‘accelerator button,’” citing the country’s recovery from the pandemic and its resumption of international exchanges.  That outreach will be boosted by a 12.2% increase in the Chinese government’s budget for diplomatic expenditure this year. It’s a drastic jump from the zero-Covid era that saw China’s borders mostly shut: In 2020, China slashed its diplomacy budget by 11.8%, before a mild 2.4% increase in 2022.    This year’s budget, pegged at 54.84 billion yuan (about $8 billion), remains below the pre-pandemic peak, but experts say it marks a significant increase for China to resume and expand its diplomatic engagement with the world. In comparison, in the US, the requested 2023 budget for “international affairs” listed on the State Department’s website was $67 billion.  And the money will be used not only to fund diplomatic trips. According to China’s Ministry of Finance, the umbrella term “diplomatic expenditure” covers a wide range of areas, from budgets for the Foreign Ministry, Chinese embassies and consulates, to China’s participation in international organizations, foreign aid and external propaganda.  Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, noted that China is likely to increase its spending on propaganda efforts targeting foreign audiences to service Beijing’s diplomatic interests – including through Chinese social media apps.  “For example, they try to extend influence in different countries, such as Singapore and Malaysia, through WeChat, targeting those who speak the Chinese language,” Wu said.  Experts also question whether some of the increase is due to the debt stress and repayment problems faced by countries under Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s signature overseas development initiative, known as the Belt and Road.

Yue Yuewei/Xinhua/Getty Images“Even if the interest and principal repayment is suspended, it still creates a large hole,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.   This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road, and Chinese leaders will likely travel the world to talk up its successes, Sun said. “That usually means more diplomatic expenditures such as aid and gift packages,” she said.  China is set to host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year, after a long delay due to the pandemic. It will also host the first in-person summit between Xi and leaders from five Central Asian countries.  “China wishes to catch up and do more to make up for the lost time and opportunities,” Sun said.  And China has a lot of catching up to do, at least in terms of stabilizing relations with developed countries.  Global surveys by the Pew Research Center have shown that public opinion toward China in advanced economies has turned “precipitously more negative” since 2017, due to concerns about Beijing’s human rights record and military buildup in the South China Sea, with the most dramatic declines between 2019 and 2020.   Since the pandemic, opinions have only deteriorated further, partly due to perceptions that China had mishandled the initial Covid outbreak in Wuhan, according to a Pew survey published last year.Sharpening rhetoric toward the USA notable shift in China’s diplomatic endeavors is a more forceful approach in publicly pushing back against the US – from the very top of the Chinese leadership.  In unusually direct remarks Monday, Xi accused the US of leading a campaign to suppress China and causing its serious domestic woes.  “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,” Xi told a group of government advisers representing private businesses on the sidelines of an annual legislative meeting in Beijing.  China’s top leader usually avoids directly attacking the US in public even as bilateral relations have deteriorated sharply. He generally refers only to “Western countries” or “some developed nations” when making critical comments about Washington.  Xi’s blunt rebuke of US policy was echoed Tuesday by Qin, the foreign minister, who said US competition with China is in fact all about “containment and suppression” and “a zero-sum game of life and death.”  “If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” Qin warned.  To longtime observers of Chinese politics, the sharpened rhetoric rings alarm bells for already tense US-China relations, with no off-ramp in sight for deescalation.  “It sure feels like the (Chinese) side has decided to level up in responding much more forcefully to what it sees as unfair US accusations and actions,” wrote Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter.  Now that Xi – the most powerful Chinese leader in decades – has lashed out at the US directly, China’s entire officialdom and propaganda machine are expected to take note and rigorously follow.   Temperatures are not likely to cool in Washington, either, given the consensus across the aisle to be tough on China and hardening American public perceptions. According to a Gallup poll released Tuesday, a record-low 15% of Americans view China favorably in 2023, a 5% fall from last year and a 38% decrease since 2018. More than eight in 10 US adults now hold a negative opinion of China, the poll said.  “Expect US-China to get worse faster,” Bishop wrote. “I fear we are entering into a much more dangerous period in US-China relations.”  Chinese leader Xi Jinping attends a session during the G20 Summit in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on November 16, 2022. Willy Kurniawan/AFP/Getty Images/File    ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy? Since late last year, some observers have noted Beijing’s softening tone on foreign affairs as it upped its diplomacy with Western governments, following Xi’s flurry of meetings with Western leaders at the G20 summit in Indonesia.  The demotion of combative foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian and the promotion of Qin – a measured former ambassador to the US – to foreign minister had been seen by some as a signal China was moving away from “wolf warrior” diplomacy, the aggressive style adopted by Beijing’s envoys in recent years.  When asked about that perceived shift Tuesday, Qin criticized “wolf warrior” diplomacy as a “narrative trap.”  “Those who coined the term and set the trap either know little about China and its diplomacy, or have a hidden agenda in disregard of facts,” Qin said. “In China’s diplomacy, there is no shortage of goodwill and kindness. But if faced with jackals or wolves, Chinese diplomats would have no choice but to confront them head-on and protect our motherland.”  To Sun, the expert at Stimson Center, the tone of Qin’s remarks did not come as a surprise – it simply aligns with China’s established lines on foreign policy, she said. “I think it is assertive and spiky, but not as aggressive as wolf warrior diplomacy was.”  Wu, the expert in Singapore, meanwhile, said he hadn’t observed much of a mellowing in Beijing’s diplomatic outreach. “Qin Gang may be a bit softer than Wang Yi,” he said, referring to Qin’s predecessor who was recently promoted as Xi’s top foreign policy adviser.   “But Wang is the No.1 official in diplomacy. They are still following Xi’s instruction to show their ‘fighting spirits’ – to go out proactively to fight hostile forces against China.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.CNN      Three years after the Covid-19 pandemic changed the lives of all Americans, we are witnessing a retrospective questioning of whether masks—and mask mandates—decrease the risk of Covid-19 spread.   dr kent sepkowitzTo try to clarify the issue, the venerable Cochrane Library led a meta-analysis of available data. Meta-analysis often is used to try to help reconcile conflicting evidence, though the approach has its doubters.  The premise is that, using a strict approach to determine which previous studies are clear enough for inclusion, experts can cobble together the results from years of work done by different investigators and published in different journals. Then, using the bigger statistical punch provided by the many, they can find a significant conclusion not evident in the few.  Cochrane’s study-of-studies, combined with its prestige, has re-animated the pens of a troupe of anti-mask-mandaters including current New York Times columnist Bret Stephens and former New York Times reporter John Tierney.  The “money quote” comes from an interview that esteemed data scientist Dr. Tom Jefferson, the lead author of the Cochrane study, gave in an interview: “There is just no evidence that (masks) make any difference, full stop.” If his statement were an accurate reflection of what the article found, the launching of a thousand op-eds would be understandable.  But this emphatically is not the conclusion of the twelve authors, of which Jefferson was just one voice. The actual Cochrane article concludes something directly at odds with Jefferson’s statement: “The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement, and relatively low adherence with the interventions during the studies hampers drawing firm conclusions… The low to moderate certainty of evidence (in favor of masks) means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and that the true effect may be different from the observed estimate of the effect,” the article notes.    In plain English, this, at least to me as a veteran reader of these types of reviews, translates to: The primary studies are not strong enough for us to say much of anything except that we may be wrong no matter what we say.   A healthcare worker prepares a dose of the Moderna Covid-19 at the Brooklyn Children's Museum vaccination site, serving children six months to 5-Years old, in the Brooklyn borough of New York, US, on Thursday, June 23, 2022. Covid-19 vaccines for children under 5 years old were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday, a welcome relief to parents of the last age group to become eligible for shots. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesNew York City to end vaccine mandate for city workers this weekA lead author such as Jefferson is of course free to speak his mind but, at least in the interview, he apparently did not distinguish his personal view from the consensus view of the authors. There may be a back-story to this: A professor at Oxford University, Jefferson seems to long have had his doubts about masks, writing articles in The Spectator and other journals to air out his sometimes curmudgeonly views.  Given their awareness of his strong personal opinions on the topic, the Cochrane Library, in the section of the recent meta-analysis called “Authors’ Declarations of Interest” writes the following: “TJ (Tom Jefferson): reports declaring an opinion on the topic of the review in articles for popular media. TJ is an Editor at the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections group but was not involved in the editorial process for this review. See full statement here: https://restoringtrials.org/competing-interests-tom-jefferson/.”  Though half of the 12 authors were “not involved in the editorial process,” for this particular article, the additional characterization by Cochrane of Jefferson, the opinionated citizen (“declaring an opinion on the topic … for popular media”), is quite unusual for the medical literature.   Furthermore, several meticulous experts active on social media have unpacked every square inch of the article to reveal many possible flaws in the analysis itself that may have blunted evidence of mask efficacy. This sort of back and forth adopts the tone of “my expert is bigger than your expert” and never leads to any resolution of differences.  Personalities and spokespeople aside, there may be an even larger issue at play here. I have long found the meta-analyses of public health studies such as masking to be uniquely challenging. Meta-analysis seems better suited to randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing this drug to that. The uncertainties in public health studies seem too great for the bigger data of a meta-analysis to overcome.

(Photo by Hector RETAMAL / AFP) (Photo by HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images)HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/AFP via Getty ImagesOpinion: What went right and wrong on CovidFor example, for masking trials, those randomized to wearing a mask or not wearing a mask cannot be blinded: A person in the unmasked arm may have snuck a mask on here and there or conversely, the masked group may have spent a day or two, or ten, unmasked. This introduces enormous and irreducible uncertainty regarding just what is happening.  Plus, focus on this particular meta-analysis—and it alone—is misguided. Other meta-analyses by experts found a “significant protective effect” from masks.  And perhaps most important of all, we have witnessed masks at work over the last three years. Yes, this is anathema to the purists who require evidence, not observation, but how else can we explain the unprecedented low (almost zero) rates of  influenza in the 2020-2021 respiratory season other than by close adherence by the many to the protective measures taken to prevent disease transmission.   Despite all the current kerfuffle, I doubt anyone will change their mind about the issue. Maskers like me will continue to believe and the anti-maskers, though perhaps walking a little taller for a moment, will continue to blame masks for everything from childhood development delays to crashing economies to a dulling of the public sensitivity to the ever-encroaching State that will, when completed, supposedly deprive everyone of all freedoms.  More alarming than the mask debate is to note that this seems to be the latest in a disturbing trend of those with a political ax to grind revisiting the three-year history of the pandemic in a way that needlessly casts doubt or misdirects attention.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Already this year, we have heard that one US agency finds weak evidence that the viral strain that overwhelmed the world was released from a lab in China; we hear ever more about how vaccines are causing a global increase in deaths albeit from a discredited source and we see more focus on the profit motive as an explanation for how the pandemic played out.   Of course, we must look back to learn from our mistakes and make our response to the inevitable next pandemic more effective. Much of the current discussion though seems to involve different groups trying to gain the upper hand of a much larger political—not scientific—debate. And the only thing we can learn from this type of proxy war is this: Everyone who is focused on the politics or media hype of the issue, at the expense of the actual science behind the public health policies, should kindly shut up.

Chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., makes an opening statement during the Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats in Hart Building on Wednesday, March 8, 2023. From left are, FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Gen. Paul Nakasone, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, CIA Director William J.Burns, and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott D.Berrier. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/APCNN      US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to press Taiwan and try to undercut US influence in the coming years as he begins a third term as president.  While Beijing has stepped up its public criticism of the US, Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the intelligence community assesses that China still believes it “benefits most by preventing a spiraling of tensions and by preserving stability in its relationship with the United States.”  Haines and the other top intelligence officials – CIA Director William Burns, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier and NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone – testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday at the panel’s annual public worldwide threats hearing.  Haines ticked through the global challenges the US faces – from China and Russia to Iran and North Korea – along with the risks related to cyber and technology as well as authoritarian governments.   China was among the top concerns for senators at the hearing, where Haines and the other intelligence chiefs were pressed on everything from China’s global ambitions to the risks of TikTok and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China.  Russia’s war in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s long-term intentions were another key issue, as Haines warned that Putin could be digging in for the long haul because the Russian military cannot make territorial gains.Russia probably does not want conflict with US and NATO, intel chiefs sayThe US intelligence community believes that Russia “probably does not want a direct military conflict with US and NATO forces, but there is potential for that to occur,” according to the unclassified annual threat assessment report of the intelligence community issued on Wednesday that US intelligence leaders testified about.   “Russian leaders thus far have avoided taking actions that would broaden the Ukraine conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders, but the risk for escalation remains significant,” the report says.   Haines said in her testimony that the Ukraine conflict has become a “grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage,” but said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to carry on, possibly for years.  “We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favor, and that prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia’s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,” Haines said.  Haines explained that Russia will likely be unable to sustain even its currently modest level of offensive operations in Ukraine without an additional mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources.  “They may fully shift to holding and defending the territories they now occupy,” said Haines  Haines called Putin’s “nuclear saber-rattling” an attempt to “deter the West from providing additional support to Ukraine.”  “He probably will still remain confident that Russia can eventually militarily defeat Ukraine and wants to prevent Western support from tipping the balance and forcing a conflict with NATO,” she said.  Still, as Russia deals with “extensive damage” from its war in Ukraine, Moscow will grow more dependent on its nuclear, cyber and space capabilities, the US intelligence agencies said in their report.  Heavy losses on the battlefield in Ukraine “have degraded Moscow’s ground- and air-based conventional capabilities and increased its reliance on nuclear weapons,” the report added.Senators concerned about China and Tik-Tok, Covid origins investigationSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence panel, argued that TikTok presents “a substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didn’t face in the past.”  The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, Wray told the panel Wednesday.   Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Rubio on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait.  “The most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something that’s very sacred in our country — the difference between the private sector and public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,” Wray said.  Rubio and Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, also pressed the intelligence leaders on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in light of a new Energy Department assessment, made with low confidence, that the pandemic likely was the result of a lab leak in Wuhan.   Haines said the intelligence community is still seeking to collect additional information to determine the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic but reiterated there’s no consensus at this point among US intelligence agencies.  “There’s a broad consensus in the intelligence community that the outbreak is not the result of a bioweapon or genetic engineering. What there isn’t a consensus on is whether or not it’s a lab leak, essentially as Director Wray indicated, or natural exposure to an infected animal,” Haines said.  Collins, a proponent of the lab leak theory, argued that the two theories should not carry the same weight.  “I just don’t understand why you continue to maintain on behalf of the intelligence community that these are two equally plausible explanations. They simply are not,” Collins said.Committee has ‘unfinished business’ on classified documentsSenate Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said that the committee still had “unfinished business” with the investigation into the handling of classified documents, reiterating that the committee still needed to see the documents taken from the offices and homes of President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.   “I think I speak for everyone on both sides of the aisle on this committee, we still have unfinished business regarding the classified documents that we need to see in order for this intelligence committee to effectively oversee its job on intelligence oversights,” said Warner during his opening remarks at the committee’s annual worldwide threats hearing.  Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, asked Haines and Wray why they hadn’t personally looked at all of the classified documents that were found. They responded they had both reviewed some but not all of the documents.   Wray said that he had gone through a “fairly meticulous listing” of all the documents with “detailed information about the contents,” while noting the FBI had teams experienced with mishandling of classified documents cases.   At the end of Wednesday’s public hearing, both Warner and Rubio pressed the intelligence chiefs to give the committee access to the classified documents so they could conduct proper oversight of the intelligence community’s damage assessment on the mishandling of the classified material.  “How can we possibly conduct oversight over whether you’ve assigned the proper risk assessment and over whether the mitigation is appropriate – how can we possibly do that if we don’t know what we’re talking about?” Rubio said. “A special counsel cannot have veto authority over Congress’ ability to do its job. It just can’t happen. It won’t happen. And so it will change the nature of the relationship between this committee.”Intel community says racially motivated extremists are most lethal threatTransnational racially and ethnically motivated extremists, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists,”remain the most lethal threat to US persons and interests,” the intelligence community said in its new report.  The report says this largely “decentralized movement” poses “a significant threat to a number of US allies and partners through attacks and propaganda that espouses violence.”  “These actors increasingly seek to sow social divisions, support fascist-style governments, and attack government institutions. The transnational and loose structure of RMVE organizations challenges local security services and creates a resilience against disruptions,” the report states, referring to racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist groups.   The report also raises concern that a prolonged conflict in Ukraine could provide foreign racially and ethnically motivated extremists “with opportunities to gain access to battlefield experience and weapons.”  Cotton questioned Haines skeptically about the assessment, arguing that deaths from fentanyl were more lethal in the US. Haines responded that while fentanyl caused more deaths, the report was in relation to terrorism threats.   “But in the context of terrorism, your conclusion is that racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists are a more lethal threat to Americans than ISIS or Al Qaeda or Hezbollah?” Cotton asked.  Haines noted that past reports had made the same assessment, as racially and ethnically motivated extremists were similarly listed as the most lethal threat to US persons and interests in the 2022 version of the intelligence community report.  “It simply is a question of how many people, how many US persons are killed or wounded as a consequence of attacks,” Haines said.  “I find this astonishing,” Cotton said at the end of his questioning.  This story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.

Gen. Laura Richardson speaks during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, March 8.House Armed Services CommitteeCNN      Senior US generals issued stark warnings to lawmakers about what they described as an “aggressive” expansion of Chinese influence in South America and the Caribbean encroaching on American interests in the region.  “The [People’s Republic of China] has the capability and intent to eschew international norms, advance its brand of authoritarianism, and amass power and influence at the expense of these democracies,” Gen. Laura Richardson, commander of US Southern Command, said on Wednesday. “The PRC has expanded its ability to extract resources, establish port, manipulate governments through predatory investment practices, and build potential dual-use space facilities — the most space facilities in any combatant command region.”   Indeed, Richardson and Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of US Northern Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that China’s expansion has included increased work on the Belt and Road Initiative, a massive international infrastructure project that seeks to expand Chinese influence around the world, as well as “economic coercion” in the Bahamas and “investment” on South American projects.  “We’ve got to pay more attention to this region,” Richardson said. “The proximity matters. They are on the 20-yard line of our homeland. We are in a neighborhood, these are our neighbors, and we have got to pay attention to them.”  American officials have voiced similar concerns about Chinese activities in other regions of the world including Africa as Beijing looks to compete with Washington not just militarily but also economically and in terms of soft power.

W DIA Director General Paul Nakasone National Security Agency NSATom Williams/CQ Roll Call/APUS intel chiefs say China likely to press Taiwan and seek to undercut USIn the Caribbean, China is “very aggressive” in the Bahamas, VanHerck said, where they have built the largest embassy in the world complete with an ambassador who “uses the information space to undermine us each and every day.”   He added that the US has not had a permanent ambassador to the Bahamas since 2011, and appointing one would “vastly help.”  VanHerck also noted that there is “significant” investment from China in Mexico, and that 80% of Mexico’s telecommunications is provided by Chinese companies.  Richardson added that while the US also has a “lot of investment” in South America, the US does not advertise it enough. And while many of those countries will seek contracts for big projects, she said, they only see “PRC and Chinese bidders,” which makes them feel they’ve “got no choice” but to work with China.  At the same time, however, Richardson said China’s investments do not actually benefit countries in the region and claimed Beijing is “taking advantage” of South American nations by pushing them into a “debt trap associated with the multiple loans” they provide.

VCG/Getty ImagesTikTok could be a valuable tool for China if it invades Taiwan, FBI director says“They don’t invest in the country, the extract … they bring their own workers, Chinese laborers, to the country and build these high-rise apartments. So the investing, you don’t see the investment in the country,” she said.  The hearing comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China, following the shootdown of a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina last month, and reports that China is considering assisting Russia in its war against Ukraine.  Chinese officials have denied claims that they are considering providing lethal military aid to Russia, but US officials have maintained that China would face “real costs” if they went forward with the support.  China has also denied that the balloon shot down off the US coast into the Atlantic Ocean was a surveillance balloon. But on Wednesday, VanHerck said the event displayed “one of the ways our competitors target us each and every day.”   “Candidly, the internal discord of this event just showed one of the ways our competitors target us each and every day in the information space,” VanHerck said, “and they’re becoming increasingly adept at driving wedges between the American people.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

IMF chief: Ukraine war will have ‘devastating’ consequences for Russia’s economy    			By Julia Horowitz, CNN		  Updated  7:27 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad Feedback'We don't see global recession': IMF chief on 2023 economic outlook    02:12   - Source:CNN Business    LondonCNN      The International Monetary Fund has drawn criticism for forecasting that Russia will see stronger economic growth this year than either the United Kingdom or Germany, despite rising pressure from Western sanctions.   But Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that the economic outlook for Russia beyond 2023 is “quite devastating.”  “When you take our projections over a medium term, what they mean is Russia[’s economy] shrinking by at least 7%,” Georgieva said in an interview that aired Wednesday.   In January, the IMF projected that Russia’s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from both the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Economists at those groups have penciled in contractions of 3.3% and 5.6% in 2023, respectively.  Even Russia’s own central bank, which extended emergency capital controls for another six months on Monday, has said gross domestic product might contract by 1% this year.  A man walks past commercial premises put up for rent and sale in Moscow on February 10, 2023. - Real estate analysts say the housing market in Russia has been on a rollercoaster ride since Russians panicked when sanctions over the country's military action in Ukraine hit and then adjusted to their new reality. First, prices spiked as home-owners sought to secure their savings when the penalties hit. Then they dropped as tens of thousands Russians opposed to the conflict and worried for their futures up and left. President Putin insists Russia is weathering the Western sanctions. A home-grown brand has replaced McDonald's and supermarkets are offering Russian-made drinks to replace foreign brands like Coca Cola, which left Russia last year. Still, Russia's economy is facing mounting problems as the West -- one year into the conflict -- is building on its sanctions program with a 10th EU package looming. Hundreds of foreign companies have exited, leaving behind emptying shopping malls, while inflation, which stands at around 12 percent, has undermined the purchasing power of Russian wages. Natalia Koleniskova/AFP/Getty ImagesRussia's economy is hurting despite Putin's blusterJeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor, wrote in Fortune magazine Monday that the “IMF has been asleep at the switch” and parroting propaganda from Russian President Vladimir Putin.  “With respect to Russia, it is naively echoing Putin’s own invented GDP forecasts, in effect, canonizing and legitimating these economic myths with no verification,” said Sonnenfeld and two colleagues, Stephen Roach and Steven Tian.  Sonnenfeld has kept a list of Western companies curtailing operations in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine one year ago and has called for firms to exit the country.  Georgieva told CNN that Russia’s economy would suffer over time as workers emigrated and access to technology was cut off, and as sanctions on its vast energy industry took a toll.  “This year what we reflect on is that Russia has managed to direct some of [its] oil sales beyond the markets of the European Union,” she said, referring to Russia’s success in rerouting crude shipments to China and India. “That is not going to be a lasting impact for the Russian economy.”   “We don’t see Russia in any way benefiting from what they have caused to Ukraine and to themselves.”  Following Europe’s recent import bans on seaborne Russian crude and oil products, Moscow’s finances have shown signs of strain. On Monday, the Russian government reported a budget deficit of 2.58 trillion rubles ($34 billion) for January and February, compared with a surplus of 415 billion ($5.5 billion) rubles in the same period in 2022. It said oil and gas revenues had fallen 46% year-over-year.Inflation fight continuesMeanwhile, the US and European economies have proven surprisingly resilient, Georgieva said. She pointed to the strength of their job markets and Europe’s swift action to limit reliance on Russian energy.  “All of this contributes positively to our prospects for growth,” Georgieva said. “We don’t see [a] global recession in the cards for this year.”  That won’t prevent a global slowdown, however, as central banks continue their campaigns to bring inflation down from the highest levels in decades. The IMF expects world economic output, which grew 3.4% in 2022, to rise 2.9% in 2023.  Yet according to Georgieva, it’s essential policymakers don’t ease up on interest rate hikes prematurely, lest prices soar again.  “Stay the course,” Georgieva advised Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.   The Fed slowed the pace of rate hikes last month, but Powell indicated in testimony to Congress Tuesday that the central bank may need to turn hawkish again.  “The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell said. The Fed “would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes” if necessary, he added.  — Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.

FloodsAs many parts of California attempt to recover from colossal amounts of snow that trapped mountain communities, more than 16 million people are now under flood watches ahead of a storm set to drench the state Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain. The places that will be impacted – mostly across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento – have already been dealt layers of snow from the previous brutal storms. In response to the ominous forecast, many residents in the region have been urged to prepare at least two weeks of essentials ahead of the likely flooding. The impending atmospheric river event won’t be the first this year to lash California. Late last year and into the new year, multiple rounds of heavy rains from atmospheric rivers soaked entire neighborhoods and unleashed mudslides that killed at least 18 people.2. Mexico kidnappingTwo of the four Americans who authorities say were kidnapped in Mexico last week have been found dead, officials said Tuesday. The other two were found alive. The group of friends traveled from South Carolina so one of them – a mother of six – could undergo a medical procedure across the border, but they never made it to the appointment. The discovery of the Americans’ whereabouts comes days after the four were targeted by a Mexican cartel that likely mistook them for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official said. Their abduction highlights the ongoing violence that has plagued some Mexican cities during the long-running Mexican drug war as well as the growing business of “medical tourism.”3. Covid-19The US is planning to relax Covid-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, a source told CNN. In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijing’s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases. Those restrictions will be relaxed this week, the source said, citing a decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths – and more data surrounding the variants that were circulating in China. The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a program that surveys travelers on details around new variants. 4. MarijuanaVoters in Oklahoma will reject a ballot measure that would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state for adults ages 21 and older, CNN projects. The measure in Tuesday’s special election would have allowed for possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the growth of up to six marijuana plants. If it had passed, there would also have been a 15% tax on sales of recreational marijuana in the state. Supporters of the measure argued it would bring in new tax revenue, but critics said it would negatively impact communities. It was one of several ballot measures on cannabis use that has been considered by voters in recent months. Similar measures in November failed in Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota, while voters in Maryland and Missouri passed measures for recreational cannabis use.5. TikTokA dozen senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Tuesday expanding President Joe Biden’s legal authority to ban TikTok nationwide, marking the latest in a string of congressional proposals threatening the social media platform’s future in the country. The legislation specifically aims to give the government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk. The proposed law takes a wide-ranging approach to fears that companies with ties to China could be pressured by that country’s government into handing over Americans’ data. The legislation has “sparked a lot of interest” from other senators beyond the 12 co-sponsors and among some members of the House in both parties, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said.BREAKFAST BROWSEWhat to know about Holi, the festival of colors  Millions of people in India and around the world are celebrating Holi this week.

The German sportswear maker said Wednesday that it would face an operating loss of €700 million ($736 million) this year— its first in 31 years — because of a potential €500 million ($527 million) hit related to unsold Yeezy stock, and the cost of a strategic review.   Shares in Adidas    (ADDDF) fell 2.2% Wednesday morning after it published its 2022 results and outlook for 2023.   The company broke off its lucrative nine-year partnership with Yeezy designer Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, in October.   Adidas said last month that its annual revenue could plunge by €1.2 billion ($1.27 billion) this year as a direct result of the split, which came after Ye made a series of antisemitic remarks.  The rupture knocked around €600 million ($633 million) off the company’s fourth-quarter revenue, Adidas said Wednesday.   But the controversy has appeared to fuel demand for Yeezy sneakers through other sellers. Last week, John Mocadlo, chief executive of Impossible Kicks, a large online reseller of high-end sneakers and clothing, said demand for the shoes had surged 30% since around last October.   Adidas could perform better this year if it “repurposes” some of its Yeezy products, the company said without elaborating. ‘Year of transition’The gloomy outlook for Adidas follows what Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer called a “disappointing year” for the German giant.  “We definitely did not perform as we should have performed,” he said when presenting the company’s results Wednesday.   Its operating profit fell 66% year-over-year to €669 million ($705 million).    While the company’s global sales grew 1% last year, it saw a 36% annual sales decline in China — its biggest single market — due partly to the nation’s now-ditched zero-Covid policy.   Adidas is hoping this year will mark a turning point.   “2023 will be a year of transition to set the base to again be a growing and profitable company,” Chief Executive Officer Bjørn Gulden said in a statement last month.  “I am convinced that over time we will make Adidas shine again. But we need some time.”  — Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.

Video Ad Feedback'I wish I did look like this': See user reactions to viral, new beauty filter    01:15   - Source:CNN BusinessNew YorkCNN      The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the short-form video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday.   Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the panel’s ranking member, on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait.  “The most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something that’s very sacred in our country —the difference between the private sector and public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,” Wray told Rubio in the hearing.   Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate panel, argued that TikTok presents “a substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didn’t face in the past.”  Wray’s comments come a day after Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the US National Security Agency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he worried TikTok could censor videos to shape public opinion in a way that threatens US national security interests.  It’s the latest in a full-court press from US officials to sound the alarm about TikTok’s alleged security risks as Congress weighs giving the Biden administration more authority to address the alleged threat posed by the platform, up to and including banning the app in the United States  TikTok CEO Shou Chew said this week that the Chinese government has “never asked us for US user data” and the company would not provide it if the government did ask. Chew also said that “misinformation and propaganda has no place on our platform, and our users do not expect that.”  The company has taken voluntary steps to wall off US user data from the rest of its global organization, including by hosting that data on servers operated by the US tech giant Oracle. The company is also negotiating a possible agreement with the Biden administration that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under certain conditions.  In a statement this week, a TikTok spokesperson said a US government ban would stifle American speech and would be “a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.”  – CNN’s Brian Fung and Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles on CNN.CNN      Last summer, I became a somewhat infamous figure on TikTok when a video I posted pitching myself to be on “Saturday Night Live” went viral — but not in the way I’d hoped. At first I was mocked en masse and parodied, but the conversation quickly veered into vitriol and outright venom, resulting in a lengthy bullying campaign that included calls for me to kill myself.  Jake NovakBradford RogneTikTok has been at the center of the national conversation as of late, with lawmakers proposing a nationwide ban on the popular video-sharing app over fears that the China-based company may be harvesting American users’ private data.   But as an online creator, I believe that the real, undeniable problem with social media is that harassment and hatred can spread on platforms like TikTok on an enormous scale with alarming speed — and it severely imperils the mental health of creators and everyday users alike.   It’s incumbent on social media companies to strengthen their content moderation practices to limit this behavior, and to ensure they do, the federal government should mandate more effective procedures to curtail the way hate can rapidly escalate online.  In the wake of the “SNL” post, my notifications were inundated with cruel comments and snide videos, from calls to action for users to bully me off the platform, to suggestions that I had not been bullied enough as a child. And when they’d had their fill on TikTok, these trolls found me on Instagram and YouTube — and even my inactive Twitter — and bombarded me with more nasty comments, tweets and videos. Altogether, the content made about me swiftly amassed millions of views and likes.   I immediately stopped posting on social media, and when my absence was noticed, the commentary changed to flippant musings wondering if the negative attention had caused me to kill myself, spawning the hashtag #RIPJakeNovak. Some users, perhaps emboldened by the hashtag, emailed me directly to tell me I should end my life if I hadn’t already.  This was my reality for months — all because of a video I posted that people thought wasn’t funny.  Elva Etienne/Moment RF/Getty ImagesOpinion: This may be the only way to stop social media from harming our kidsSocial media creators are all too aware that the platforms that give them their creative outlet, and in many cases their livelihood, can turn hostile on them at any moment. Horror stories of users being mercilessly hectored and doxxed — where identifying information like physical addresses is published on the internet, usually maliciously — are far too common. And recently, there has been an uptick in swatting, where individuals falsely accuse someone of a made-up crime with the goal of sending armed police to their home, a prank that can turn fatal.  My version of this came when users discovered I worked as a performer at Disneyland and began coming there to film me and post the videos on TikTok. The captions often referenced the fact that I was alive, usually with bemusement or faux relief. But on the other side of the lens, I grew to fear more than what these people were saying about me.   Several of my coworkers received a message on Instagram that seemed to threaten my life, which meant that each video of me “in the wild” was not just a potential source of humiliation, but a beacon letting the entire internet — including those who wished me harm — know my location in real-time. Yet there was no recourse to be taken: I was in a public position that allowed, even encouraged, anyone who wanted to film me at will. I was alone and exposed and scared.  But I still had to go to work. Every performance, my anxiety was through the roof, wondering if that person who shouted my name was just being a harmless jerk or planned to follow me in the parking lot. That fear stayed with me outside of my workplace, too: at restaurants, grocery stores, the car wash. I slept on friends’ couches because I was afraid someone might have found my home address. I couldn’t be sure how far it would go.  Is the Chinese government using TikTok to invade Americans’ privacy for political gain? Who knows. Are Americans using social media to harass their fellow Americans? You betcha.  TikTok’s community guidelines pledge intolerance for users being “shamed, bullied, or harassed,” acknowledging that such content “can cause severe psychological distress.” The platform claims to take down videos for harassment — many before they’re even reported — and that is a good start. Some harassing comments and videos about me have indeed been removed in recent months. But that wasn’t before they got to me — and potentially influenced the creation of other harassing comments and videos.  I did not reach out to any social media platforms to report the bullying I received; even if I had, it was so widespread that I wouldn’t have known where to start. Instead, in the interest of preventing that disturbing hashtag from coming true, I deleted all social apps from my phone. I have yet to reinstall them.  The US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2023. Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesOpinion: The Supreme Court could end social media companies' charadeI’m aware that as an entertainer — and an internet creator, especially — I am subject to people having and sharing opinions about me and my work. But what started as discussion about me turned into pointed attacks toward me. The former is discourse, which is very much within the scope of acceptable behavior toward a public figure; the latter is harassment, which is very much not.  But not all who experience cyberbullying are internet personalities who have opened themselves up to public critiques. Many targets are everyday users who find themselves unwillingly thrust into an antagonizing spotlight, and the effects can be devastating.   A 2018 review of 26 independent studies that were published between 1996 and 2017 (TikTok was released in September 2016) found that adults and young people are more than 2.5 times as likely to attempt suicide when they’ve faced online bullying, and the CDC says that levels of sadness and thoughts of suicide among teen girls have “increased dramatically” over the past decade. The same 2021 study notes that 16% of high school students surveyed by the CDC said that they had been “electronically bullied” through social media or over text in the past year.   We saw a tragic convergence of this just last month, when 14-year-old Adriana Kuch died by suicide two days after a clip of her being assaulted at her New Jersey high school was shared on TikTok. She told her father before she died that she didn’t want to be “that girl who gets beat up on video and made fun of.”  Social media companies are not without the tools to address the persecution that can proliferate on their platforms, yet they seem to not use them as well as they should.   Some sites reportedly utilize a form of “shadow-banning,” when the reach of a post is inhibited for community violations, but the practice is famously opaque and algorithms can misinterpret allowed content as verboten. Companies like Meta, parent of Facebook and Instagram, employ scores of human moderators who screen content around the clock, yet the moderators say they have made judgment mistakes due to confusing and constantly changing policies. Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council, which advised on issues including suicide prevention and mental health, was disbanded late last year. It doesn’t take much to understand why stories like mine — and many far more heartbreaking — pervade the online zeitgeist.  Perhaps unexpectedly, I don’t want TikTok to be banned — in fact, I hope it won’t be. I loved being a creator: the grind of making videos all the time, the challenge to push myself in new directions on a dime, the thrill of watching strangers around the world connect with a song I wrote minutes after filming it in my bedroom. I loved seeing the work fellow creators would make and feeling inspired by it. I miss TikTok. Before it was terrifying, it was exhilarating.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook That was the promise of social media: a place where we can go to talk and share and laugh and think and come together. These are digital spaces where everyone is purported to feel welcome, yet I and so many others continue to flee them for fear of our physical safety. These platforms have had close to two decades to deliver on their promise and have failed again and again. Perhaps it is time to stop hoping that they will.   Senator Marco Rubio said recently that “The federal government has yet to take a single meaningful action to protect American users from the threat of TikTok.” But if legislation to ban the app because of Chinese privacy concerns passes, that statement will still hold true. Even if TikTok disappears from American life altogether, online hate and bullying will persist on other platforms until the government mandates stronger, broader and more efficient content moderation on social media specifically designed to protect us from harassment.  To the potential chagrin of those whose posts cheered it, my story thankfully did not end with suicide. But it’s all too clear that the next victim’s tale could have a much more lethal conclusion — in fact, it already did.  Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: Call or text 988.

US senators unveil bipartisan bill empowering Biden to ban TikTok and other services    			By Brian Fung, CNN		  Updated  3:45 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackCybersecurity expert talks TikTok concerns    06:13   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      A dozen US senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Tuesday expanding President Joe Biden’s legal authority to ban TikTok nationwide, marking the latest in a string of congressional proposals threatening the social media platform’s future in the United States.  The legislation, called the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act, does not target TikTok specifically for a ban. But it aims to give the US government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk.  Adobe StockHouse panel votes to advance bill empowering Biden to ban TikTokThe proposed law takes a wide-ranging approach to fears that companies with ties to China could be pressured by that country’s government into handing over Americans’ sensitive personal information or communications records. In the case of TikTok, lawmakers have said China’s national security laws could force TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to provide access to TikTok’s US user data.   TikTok CEO Shou Chew said this week the company has never received such a request from the Chinese government and would never comply with one. The company has taken voluntary steps to wall off US user data from the rest of its global organization, including by hosting that data on servers operated by the US tech giant Oracle. The company is also negotiating a possible agreement with the Biden administration that could allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under certain conditions.   In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said a US government ban would stifle American speech and would be “a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.”  But that has not stopped many policymakers from seeking tougher measures against the company.   Last week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced a bill that would require the Biden administration to issue a nationwide TikTok ban if an assessment of the platform found potential risks to US user data — risks that multiple administration officials have already said exist.   Another bill led by Sen. Marco Rubio would ban transactions by social media companies based in or under the “substantial influence” of countries considered US foreign adversaries.  Tuesday’s bill, unveiled by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner and South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune, is less prescriptive — granting the Commerce Department wide discretion to identify, and then to mitigate, perceived risks stemming from technology produced by companies with ties to foreign adversaries including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela.   The bill specifically directs the Secretary of Commerce to “identify, deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise mitigate” national security risks associated with technology linked to those countries. It enables the Commerce Secretary to negotiate, enter into, impose and enforce “any mitigation measure” in response.   That latitude would reflect an entirely new authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce, not authority derived from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.   The legislation would cover a broad range of technologies in addition to social media, Warner said, including artificial intelligence, financial technology services, quantum computing and e-commerce. The bill’s text also prioritizes technology in satellite and mobile networks, cloud services and storage, internet infrastructure providers, home internet gear, commercial and personal drones, video games and payment apps, among others.   Under the bill, the US government would also be required to declassify and share evidence gathered by the intelligence community to substantiate allegations that a given company or product poses a national security risk.  The bill would shift US policy away from an ad hoc scramble focused on individual companies, and provide the US government with a systematic legal structure for addressing tech-driven spying threats, Warner said.   In recent years, US concerns about Chinese espionage have largely focused on telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE, who produce wireless gear for cellular networks. But those have expanded to include makers of surveillance cameras and, more recently, apps and software makers such as TikTok.  “Instead of playing whack-a-mole on Huawei one day, ZTE the next, Kasperky, TikTok — we need a more comprehensive approach to evaluating and mitigating these threats posed by these foreign technologies from these adversarial nations,” said Warner, adding that the bill was crafted in consultation with the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Justice and Treasury, along with US intelligence officials, the Federal Communications Commission and the White House.  In a statement, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan endorsed the bill, calling it “a systematic framework for addressing technology-based threats to the security and safety of Americans.”  “This will help us address the threats we face today, and also prevent such risks from arising in the future,” Sullivan said.  Warner added that the legislation has “sparked a lot of interest” from other senators beyond the 12 co-sponsors and among some members of the House in both parties.

This is his warning to the US    02:36Now playing   - Source:CNNSee More VideosTokyoCNN      China should not be surprised Washington and its allies in Asia are deepening military ties given Beijing’s aggressive behavior toward many of its neighbors, the US ambassador to Japan said Wednesday in an exclusive interview with CNN.  “You look at India, you look at the Philippines, you look at Australia, you look at the United States, Canada or Japan. They (China) have had in just the last three months a military or some type of confrontation with every country. And then they’re shocked that countries are taking their own steps for deterrence to protect themselves. What did they think they were going to do?” Ambassador Rahm Emanuel said in the interview at his residence in Tokyo.  The US envoy listed a string of what he said were aggressive military actions by China, including “attacks” against India along their shared Himalayan border, Chinese coast guard ships aiming lasers at Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, the firing of missiles into Japan’s exclusive economic zone and the harassment of US, Canadian and Australian aircraft by People’s Liberation Army ships and planes.  Beijing has denied being an aggressor in all those instances and accused Washington of being the primary instigator of heightened tensions in the region.  On Tuesday, China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that “conflict and confrontation” with the US is inevitable if Washington does not change course.  “The US claims it seeks to compete with China but does not seek conflict. But in reality, the so-called ‘competition’ by the US is all-round containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death,” he said during his first news conference in the new post.  “Containment and suppression will not make America great, and the US will not stop the rejuvenation of China,” Qin said.Japan and South KoreaEmanuel countered on Wednesday that military buildups and exercises by the US and its partners in the Indo-Pacific are not acts of containment, as Beijing charges, but acts of deterrence against further – and possibly more dangerous – Chinese aggression.  “They’ve come together to realize that (Chinese aggression) can’t continue as is, so every country is taking steps, both within an alliance (and) also within their own self-interest of creating a comprehensive coalition of deterrence. That’s what’s going on,” Emanuel said.  He praised Japan for doubling its defense budget and taking on a leadership role in the region, citing plans for it to operate joint South China Sea patrols with the Philippines and its agreement with South Korea just this week to settle grievances dating back to before World War II concerning Japan’s colonial rule in Korea.  And he praised both Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for putting the future before history and taking a stance that has prompted domestic backlash in both Tokyo and Seoul.  “I do think that both leaders showed a braveness and a boldness to look to the 21st century and make the most of that rather than being tied by 20th century,” Emanuel said.  “To me the test of leadership is to be idealistic enough to know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And then tough enough to get it done,” he said, adding that both Kishida and Yoon had passed that test.‘Gravitational pull of freedom’The US ambassador also contrasted the countries Japan has been partnering with, including South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, India and even the United Kingdom, with countries with whom China works, including Russia, North Korea and Iran.  “There’s a phrase in America, you’re known by the company you keep,” Emanuel said.  Over the past 18 months, the Biden administration has been keeping good company, too, he said, noting its record in uniting allies and partners.  Emanuel cited multilateral agreements like the Quad – the informal alliance of the US, Japan, Australia and India – and the AUKUS deal for nuclear-powered submarines between the US, Australia and the UK as well as other economic, diplomatic and military initiatives.  “I think that has given our allies confidence, like Japan, to increase the defense budget, to be more active on the diplomatic arena and stage,” he said, giving credit to Tokyo for getting eight of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to vote to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a March 3 United Nations General Assembly vote.  Countries around the world will respond to Japan, or South Korea, or the US for a simple reason that China doesn’t understand, “the gravitational pull of freedom,” Emanuel said.  “A rules-based system that upholds respect both for the individual and in trying to uphold freedom has its own, I don’t know how else to say it, but seductive gravitational pull.”    CNN’s Nectar Gan, Emiko Jozuka and Alex Stambaugh contributed to this report.

A healthcare worker labels a Covid-19 test from an international traveler at a CDC Covid-19 variant testing site inside Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California, US, on Jan. 9, 2023. An official told CNN that the US could relax Covid testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday. Jill Connelly/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILECNN      The US is planning to relax Covid-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, a source familiar told CNN Tuesday, citing a decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and more data surrounding the variants that were circulating in China.  In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijing’s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases.  The source said the order was put in place in an effort to protect US citizens following “a large wave of infections in the PRC,” coupled with “a lack of transparency” by Chinese officials surrounding the surge.  The Washington Post was first to report news of the relaxed travel restrictions.   The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) program that surveys travelers on details around new variants.   The testing requirement instated in January came after China dismantled its controversial and long-held zero-Covid policy in early December, catching many in the country by surprise.  US officials expressed concern at the time over the risk of a new variant emerging  in China while they had limited insight into the increase in infections.   Tuesday’s announcement also comes after a US Department of Energy assessment that the virus likely emerged from a laboratory accident in China placed further strain on relations between the US and China.  The department’s “low confidence” determination – a minority view among the US intelligence agencies – prompted the Chinese Foreign Ministry to call for the US “to respect science and facts, stop politicizing this issue, stop its intelligence-led, politics-driven origins-tracing.”  China has fiercely denied that the virus emerged from a lab accident but has complicated outside efforts to understand how the pandemic originated.

China censors women modeling lingerie on livestream shopping – so men are doing it    			By Chris Lau and Kathleen Magramo, CNN		  Updated  6:00 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackMen are modeling lingerie in China. Here's why    00:50   - Source:CNN Business    Hong KongCNN      Donning a sassy piece of silk lingerie, a male model grooves to the beat and forms a heart shape with his fingers during a livestreaming session on Douyin, one of China’s most popular video-sharing platforms.   His modeling performance is the latest illustration of the kind of entrepreneurial innovation sometimes needed to bypass China’s rigorous internet censorship, a dragnet that can ensnare seemingly innocuous activities – in this case retailers selling women’s underwear online.  China deploys one of the world’s most stringent censorship regimes, with a track record of blocking out not just politically sensitive information but images of women’s bodies deemed marginally racy.  Several businesses specializing in selling lingerie through livestreaming have had their sessions cut short after they featured a female model and their brush with internet censorship came to light in January.   Hence the use of men instead.   On one of the sales channels, a man is seen dressed in black lingerie, standing next to a mannequin showing a similar outfit, in what appears to be a screenshot of a livestream broadcast on Alibaba    (BABA)’s Taobao Live, a streaming platform for the e-commerce giant.  In another image, a different male model put on a pink slip dress and silky shawl, accessorized with cat ear headbands.  A man poses in a white dress and robe set posted on Chinese video-sharing platform Douyin on December 17, 2022.DouyinIn one livestream clip, carried by multiple state media outlets, an owner of an online venture said he was simply trying to play it safe.   “This is not an attempt at sarcasm. Everyone is being very serious about complying with the rules,” the man, who identified himself as Mr Xu, said.  The emergence of male lingerie models has caused mixed views online in China, from merriment and annoyance to reluctant acceptance.   “So what should I do if I want to promote and showcase lingerie in the live broadcast session? It’s very simple, find a man to wear it,” read one comment on China’s microblogging site Weibo.  A man in a mini slip dress and velvet robe models beside a woman in pajamas in a video posted on Douyin on February 17, 2023.Douyin    Massive industryLivestreaming sales of products is a multibillion-dollar industry in mainland China, and was given a major boost during the three years of the country’s strict Covid lockdowns that battered many bricks and mortar businesses.  As of June last year, the number of livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China is over 460 million, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing’s commerce ministry.  A 2021 report by iResearch, a Beijing-based firm specializing in measuring audience growth online, predicted the livestream sector would be worth as much as $720 billion this year.  Male models are not the only workaround.  On Douyin, the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, other female models have circumvented the censorship by showcasing the latest style of lingerie on themselves on top of a t-shirt they are already wearing.   Others displayed the items on mannequins.  E-commerce livestreamer Austin Li Jiaqi attends a public-welfare livestreaming ceremony on September 23, 2021 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China.VCG/Getty ImagsChina's 'Lipstick King' returns to live-streaming show after mysterious three-month disappearanceIn 2015, China led a crackdown on television shows exposing actresses’ cleavage, forcing some of the most popular costume dramas to zoom in on their faces to avoid getting into trouble with the broadcast authorities.   Having male influencers promoting female-oriented products is not new in China, either.   One of the industry’s most successful livestream shopping influencers is Austin Li Jiaqi, who made his name as the “Lipstick King” after selling 15,000 lipsticks in just five minutes in 2018.  As one of China’s biggest internet celebrities, Li also peddles cosmetics, skincare products and fashion apparel, often applying products he’s selling to his own face.  Even outside of China, platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have faced criticism for restricting the sharing of images involving partial nudity, especially of women.  Facebook and Instagram’s parent company, Meta, restricts the sharing of breasts, although it says it intends “to allow images that are shared for medical or health purposes.” But even Meta’s own Oversight Board has called on the company to make its policy less confusing and more gender inclusive.  YouTube says it prohibits “the depiction of clothed or unclothed genitals, breasts, or buttocks that are meant for sexual gratification,” but it may age-restrict other images or videos involving nudity.

Russia says it may challenge Biden’s nominee to head the World Bank    			By Reuters  Published  6:17 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackWorld Bank president: We're facing a global recession in 2023    05:42   - Source:CNNRussia is consulting with its allies about challenging the US nominee to head the World Bank, Moscow’s top representative at the organization said Tuesday. The move could complicate what was expected to be a smooth succession process.  Russia remains a voting member of the World Bank, although the bank halted all programs in Russia and Belarus last March, citing what it called “hostilities against the people of Ukraine” following Russia’s invasion.  Roman Marshavin, the World Bank executive director who represents Russia and Syria, told Reuters the “listing of potential candidates and consultations are still ongoing,” but gave no details. He said the decision would be made in Moscow.  US President Joe Biden last month nominated ex-Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, 63, to replace David Malpass at the helm of the World Bank, which oversees billions of dollars in funding for developing countries.  Russia’s plans were first reported by Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency.  It quoted Marshavin as saying he was in discussions with other countries about possible candidates including Russian financiers and foreign economists, former heads of international organizations, as well as several ex-ministers of finance and heads of central banks.  Marshavin declined to comment on the specifics of the TASS report or which other countries were involved.TensionsBanga, who is traveling in Africa this week, said last week that he had already won support from India, Ghana and Kenya. He also received positive reviews from France and Germany at last month’s meeting of Group of 20 finance officials, and on Tuesday won the endorsement of Bangladesh.  The US Treasury declined to comment on the possible Russian challenge.  While the bank will accept nominations from other countries until March 29, Biden’s nomination all but assures that Banga will fill the role.  The World Bank has been headed by someone from the United States, the lender’s dominant shareholder, since its founding at the end of World War Two.  A challenge from Russia or an allied country is unlikely to change the outcome, given the shareholding structure, but it could expose simmering tensions between the United States and Western nations and China — the World Bank’s third-largest shareholder — over the bank and other global financial institutions.

China shakes up government to counter financial risks and US tech restrictions    			Analysis by Laura He, CNN		  Published  3:40 AM EST, Wed March 8, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackHow worrisome are U.S. China relations?    03:31   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      China has announced a major government overhaul that will shakeup the oversight of its financial system and aims to boost its technological self-reliance, as a tech war with the United States intensifies.  The change to the State Council, the country’s cabinet, is the biggest in years and the third since Chinese leader Xi Jinping took power in 2013. The plan will further strengthen Xi’s personal control over government institutions and allow him to install more trusted men in key posts.   A tighter grip over key departments is perceived to be helpful in aligning them with Xi’s priorities, which range from maintaining social and economic stability to managing rising geopolitical tension with the United States.  “These proposed institutional changes reflect key focus areas of Chinese policymakers in the next few years, namely improving financial regulation coordination to enhance financial stability,” Goldman Sachs analysts said on Wednesday.  The State Council, the government’s top executive body, oversees 26 ministries and dozens of ministry-level administrative bodies. While major decisions are ultimately made by the Communist Party’s Politburo, the State Council exercises a certain amount of power to implement those policies, especially in economic areas.   Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, takes part in a deliberation with his fellow deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu Province, at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress NPC in Beijing, capital of China, March 5, 2023. Li Xueren/Xinhua/Getty ImagesXi Jinping hits out at US as he urges China's private firms to 'fight' alongside Communist PartyBeijing also plans to downsize the so-called “iron rice bowl,” a popular term for jobs with guaranteed security. The number of civil servant positions in the central government will be cut by 5% over the next five years.   Among the changes announced Tuesday during the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, Beijing will set up a new powerful financial regulator: the National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA).    It will replace the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) supervising commercial banks and insurance companies.   It will directly manage the country’s major financial holding companies, including fintech giant Ant Group, a task that previously belonged to the People’s Bank of China. It will also be responsible for financial consumer protection and investor protection.   Some analysts said Beijing’s apparent move to reassert state control of the economy could frighten investors, said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank.  “Sentiment may worsen as investors should remain cautious on any tasks of regulation tightening given the experiences in the tech sector, housing markets and private tuition industry,” he said. “It appears that the battles of regulation tightening are not yet over.”  Deputies to the National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People  in Beijing on March 7, 2023. VCG/Getty Images    A super regulatorChina’s financial system has traditionally been jointly overseen by the People’s Bank of China, the CBIRC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).  Now, the new NFRA will supervise all financial sectors except the securities industry, which will remain under the CSRC.   The new regulator is meant to “better manage risks” in the financial system and strengthen the supervision of “institutions, behaviors, and functions,” the government proposal said. Supervision will be “penetrating,” it added.  “Establishing a super regulator will help enhance and broaden the regulation in financing and banking industries, which have becoming more complex and interlinking other industries,” said Cheung.  Depositors protest in front of the Henan branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, demanding their money back after their funds were frozen. From Lan Nuo Nuo in FebruarySmall banks in China are running into trouble. Savers could lose everythingThe move comes as risks to the stability of China’s financial system are rising amid a housing market slump and economic slowdown.   The property sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of total bank loans, is in the midst of its worst downturn on record.   Financial stress has already emerged in multiple areas, from last summer’s protests at rural banks in Henan to widespread mortgage boycotts and growing defaults by property developers.   As part of the overhaul, the CSRC will be upgraded from a “public institution” to a “government institution.” On top of its existing responsibilities, it will be given a new one for reviewing and approving corporate bond issuance, which currently falls under the National Development and Reform Commission.  This move demonstrates Beijing’s “increased focus on developing the equity market and pushing forward more direct financing to better allocate capital and help slow the buildup in debt,” Goldman Sachs said.Achieving tech self-relianceThe proposal includes multiple efforts to boost China’s technology and innovation as it tries to counter growing restrictions from the United States on selling advanced technology to China.   The existing Ministry of Science and Technology will be restructured and enhanced. It will be tasked with advancing the “whole nation system” for innovation, with a greater focus on basic research and applying technology to existing industries.  “Facing the grim situation of the international tech race and external containment and suppression, [we must] … better coordinate scientific and technological forces to overcome difficulties in key core technologies, and quickly achieve self-reliance in advanced technologies,” the proposal said.  On Monday, Xi hit out at the United States, while calling on China’s private companies to flight alongside the Communist Party and boost growth and tech innovation.    China will also establish a new department to oversee its vast troves of data. The National Data Bureau will be tasked with drafting data-related regulations and coordinating the sharing and utilization of data.  “Data … is set to be increasingly important going forward,” Citi analysts said. “Its use will be put under [a] more structured regulation going forward.”  The previous regulatory onslaught on Big Tech might be over, but regulation of the industry will be more “normalized,” they said.   Beijing launched a sweeping regulatory crackdown against the country’s internet industry from late 2020 to 2022, which was aimed at bringing powerful tech companies in line with its priorities. The Communist Party made clear before the start of the crackdown that it needs “politically sensible people” in the private sector, who will “firmly listen to the party and follow the party.”  — CNN’s Wayne Chang contributed to this report.

This is his warning to the US    02:36Now playing   - Source:CNNSee More VideosCNN      China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned Tuesday that “conflict and confrontation” with the United States is inevitable if Washington does not change course, delivering a stern and wide-ranging rebuke of US policies for his first press conference in the new role.  Qin, who was until recently China’s ambassador to the US, built up a reputation for being careful and accomplished diplomat while overseas.  But he struck a far more combative tone in his first appearance as foreign minister at China’s annual parliamentary meeting, warning of the “catastrophic consequences” of what he described as a “reckless gamble” by Washington in how it treats its fellow superpower.  “If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,” Qin said on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress in Beijing.  At the highly scripted event, Qin set the tone for China’s foreign policy for the coming year and beyond, berating the US for rising bilateral tensions and defending Beijing’s close partnership with Moscow.  Ties between the world’s two largest economies are at their worst in decades, and tensions soared further last month after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated over North America and was then shot down by US fighter jets.  On Tuesday, Qin accused the US of overreacting in its response, which he said created “a diplomatic crisis that could have been avoided.”  The incident, Qin said, shows “the US perception and views of China are seriously distorted. It regards China as its primary rival and the biggest geopolitical challenge.”  “The US claims it seeks to compete with China but does not seek conflict. But in reality, the so-called ‘competition’ by the US is all-round containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death,” he said.   “Containment and suppression will not make America great, and the US will not stop the rejuvenation of China,” Qin said.Colliding powers The great power rivalry between the US and China has intensified in recent years.  Under leader Xi Jinping, China has become increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive abroad, taking a more aggressive approach to exert its influence and counter the West.   And Washington has pushed back.  Under the Biden administration, the US has shored up ties with allies and partners to contain Beijing’s rising influence, including in its backyard.   It has also pushed to decouple from China in emerging technologies, recently banning the export of advanced chips to the fury of Beijing.  Qin lashed out at Washington for its Indo-Pacific strategy, accusing it of forming exclusive blocks to provoke confrontation, advocating for decoupling and plotting an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO.”  “The real purpose of the Indo-Pacific strategy is to contain China,” Qin said. “No Cold War should be repeated in Asia, and no Ukraine-style crisis should be repeated in Asia.”  China’s refusal to condemn Russia for the invasion of Ukraine and its growing partnership with Moscow have further strained its relations with the West. While Beijing has sought to cast itself as a neutral peace broker, it has also defended its “rock-solid” ties with Russia.  On Tuesday Qin said the Sino-Russian relationship “does not pose a threat to any country in the world, nor will it be interfered or sowed discord in by any third party.”  “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations,” he said.  Qin highlighted the issue of Taiwan as the “bedrock of the political foundation of Sino-US relations and the first red line that must not be crossed.”   The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and refuses to rule out the use of force to “reunify” it with mainland China.  On Tuesday, Qin urged the US not to “interfere in China’s internal affairs” and questioned Washington’s different responses to the issues of Ukraine and Taiwan.  “Why does the US talk up respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Ukraine issue, but does not respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on the issue of Taiwan? Why does the US ask China not to provide weapons to Russia while keeps selling arms to Taiwan?” Qin said.McCarthy visit?Qin’s remarks come amid reports of a potential meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April.  The Financial Times reported Monday that Tsai could meet McCarthy in California, rather than in Taiwan as the US Speaker had initially indicated.   A US State Department spokesperson said Monday he was “not aware of any confirmed travel” by the Taiwanese President, and Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it had no information to share regarding any potential US visit.  However, regardless of the location, a face to face between Tsai and a senior US politician will most certainly draw the ire of Beijing, fueling even more tensions in already tense relations across the Taiwan Strait – and between US and China.  Defying Beijing’s threats of retaliation, McCarthy’s Democratic predecessor Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August in the first trip by a US Speaker in 25 years.   Beijing responded by staging unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan and cutting off key lines of communication with the US.   China’s Foreign Ministry has since warned McCarthy not to visit Taiwan.  Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Program, said Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy in California is not necessarily a “replacement or downgrade.”   Instead, it could be an “add-on,” he said, suggesting McCarthy could always visit Taiwan at a later date.  While Taiwan wants to normalize high-level visits by American officials to Taiwan, it also needs to be seen by its Western partners that it is being a responsible stakeholder in the process.  “Some may think that there is better timing than this current moment to be pursing another US speaker visit to Taiwan,” Sung said.  A meeting in the US, he added, could serve as “a very visual deliverable in the short term to show continued US support for Taiwan, regardless of change of party leadership in the legislature.”   Tsai has transited in the US before on her visits to Taipei’s diplomatic allies.  She last visited the US in 2019 and gave a speech in New York – a trip that angered Beijing.  To China, Tsai’s potential meeting with McCarthy will be provocative no matter where it takes place, Sung said.  “Beijing is going to be very unhappy and protest vigorously regardless. So I guess for them it will be a difference in intensity, but not a difference in kind. Beijing won’t like any such high level exchange be it taking place on Taiwan or US soil.”    CNN’s Eric Cheung in Taipei contributed to reporting.

Sri Lanka expects approval of $2.9 billion IMF deal after China support    Reuters  Updated  5:33 AM EST, Tue March 7, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackChina has a new foreign minister. This is his warning to the US    02:36   - Source:CNNColomboReuters      Sri Lanka expects final approval from the International Monetary Fund for a $2.9 billion loan in the third or fourth week of this month, the president said on Tuesday, adding that new support from China means all funding requirements had been met.  The country of 22 million people is struggling with its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.  President Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament there were signs the economy was improving but there was still insufficient foreign currency for all imports, making the IMF deal crucial so other creditors could also start releasing funds.  “Sri Lanka has completed all prior actions that were required by the IMF,” Wickremesinghe said.  He said the Export-Import Bank of China had sent “a new letter” on Monday, and he and the central bank governor had sent a letter of intent to the IMF.  GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - NOVEMBER 01: Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa presents his national statement during day two of COP26 at SECC on November 1, 2021 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. 2021 sees the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference. The conference will run from 31 October for two weeks, finishing on 12 November. It was meant to take place in 2020 but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. (Photo by Andy Buchanan - Pool/Getty Images)Andy Buchanan/Getty ImagesFormer Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa requests to travel to Thailand “As a result of this step and financing assurances from India and the Paris Club, we expect approval for the program either in the third or fourth week of March,” he said.  The country’s international debt and currency roared higher on the news, with bonds adding nearly 3 cents on the dollar while the rupee jumped nearly 8% to a 10-month high.  It was not clear what new support China, the world’s biggest sovereign creditor, extended to Sri Lanka on Monday.   In January, the Export-Import Bank of China offered Sri Lanka a two-year moratorium on its debt and said it would support its efforts to secure the IMF loan, which a Sri Lankan source said at the time was not enough to meet IMF conditions.  China and India are Sri Lanka’s biggest lenders. By end-2020, Sri Lanka owed the Export-Import Bank of China $2.83 billion or 3.5% of the island’s external debt, according to IMF data.‘A lot of positivity’In total, Sri Lanka owed Chinese lenders $7.4 billion, or nearly a fifth of public external debt, by end-2022, calculations by the China Africa Research Initiative showed.  Sri Lanka’s rupee hit a mid-rate of 325 on Tuesday, appreciating 12%, analysts said, against the central bank-set spot rate of 337.67. The appreciation was driven by better dollar inflows from tourism and remittances, positive sentiment over imminent approval of an IMF deal and a downturn in imports, analysts said.  China's research and survey vessel, the Yuan Wang 5, arrives at Hambantota port on August 16, 2022.Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesChinese research ship Yuan Wang 5 docks at Sri Lanka's Hambantota port“There is a lot of positivity around a possible IMF announcement and more dollar loans are expected with an approval of the bailout,” said Udeeshan Jonas, chief strategist at equity research firm CAL Research.  “Also, speculators who were hoarding dollars have started to panic and convert with the rupee starting to appreciate.”  Sri Lanka needs to repay about $6 billion on average each year until 2029 and will have to keep engaging with the IMF, Wickremesinghe said.  Countries in debt distress such as Zambia and Sri Lanka have faced unprecedented delays in securing IMF bailouts as China and Western economies have clashed over how to provide debt relief. Sri Lanka has been waiting for about 187 days to finalize a bailout after reaching a staff-level deal with the IMF.  This compares to a median of 55 days it took low- and middle-income countries over the past decade to go from preliminary deal to board sign-off, according to public data from more than 80 cases compiled by Reuters.  Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday that his country would continue to participate in the settlement of international debt problems in a constructive manner.  Responding to a question on the sidelines of an annual parliament meeting in Beijing, Qin also said that China should be the last to be accused of causing debt traps in other countries and called on other parties to share the burden.

She’s had an impressive 200 careers on her resume — doctor, astronaut, computer engineer, CEO and even presidential candidate.   For International Women’s Day on March 8, Mattel (which owns the Barbie brand) is hoping to inspire young girls to embrace the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by honoring a select group of STEM pioneers with their own Barbie doll.  Among them are the Wojcicki sisters — Susan (longtime CEO of YouTube), Anne (CEO of at-home DNA testing company 23andME) and Janet (professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco).  Susan Wojcicki announced in February that was “stepping back” from her leadership role at YouTube after nearly a decade of running the video-sharing platform.  Wojcicki has been involved with YouTube’s parent company Google from its earliest days, when its two founders worked out of her garage in California to build a search engine. She later became Google’s 16th employee and has worked at the company for nearly 25 years.   Barbie is honoring women leaders in STEM for International Women's Day this year with one-of a-kind dolls made in the likeness of trailblazers such as the Wojcicki sisters.MattelThe group also includes women STEM trailblazers from around the world such as Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a space scientist and educator from the United Kingdon;  Antje Boetius, a marine researcher and microbiologist from Germany; Li Yinuo, co-founder of ETU Education, a school startup in China that offers a more personalized education; and Katya Echazarreta, an electrical engineer who has worked on five NASA missions and the first woman born in Mexico to travel to space.  “Our parents fostered independence and a belief that we could truly be anything we wanted to be when I grew up, but most important was to pursue a passion,” Anne Wojcicki said in a statement. “I hope that sharing our stories encourages young girls to try something new, face something that may scare them, and look at challenges as exciting opportunities.”   Mattel said these one-of-a-kind dolls are not for sale and will be gifted to the women who inspired them.  From left to right, clockwise: Susan Wojcicki, Sheryl Sandberg, Meg Whitman, Marissa Mayer.Elijah Nouvelage/Eric Gaillard/Reuters/David Paul Morris/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA generation of high-profile women tech leaders have stepped aside. What's next?  According to Mattel, Barbie herself has held more than 40 different STEM careers, including astrophysicist, space scientist, doctor and robotics engineer. While women in the real world make up half of the US workforce, they still only make up less than one-third of the STEM workforce.  “STEM is a field where women are severely underrepresented, and our hope is that honoring these seven leaders in science and technology will encourage girls to follow their passion in this field,” Lisa McKnight, executive vice president and global head of Barbie & Dolls with Mattel, said in a statement.  The Barbie STEM role models are the latest in an effort by Mattel to champion the achievements of women leaders across professions. For example, the company honored television producer and writer Shonda Rhimes with her own Barbie doll last year and style icon Iris Apfel in 2018.  Mattel’s push to expand into Barbies based on real-life extraordinary women has helped boost the Barbie collector market, said Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of Toys, Tots, Pets & More, an industry review website.  “The Barbie collector market has been strong for many years but Mattel has pivoted to featuring many more role models,” said Silver. “The shift has been extremely popular with their collector fans and also has garnered widespread attention for those role models who should be honored and often don’t get the recognition they deserve.”  Renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall also got her own Barbie in 2022 as part of the Inspiring Women Series of Barbie dolls that are based on  women who have been prominent figures in history. The Jane Goodall Barbie was for sale. The Inspiring Women Barbie series, priced at $35 for the doll, are typically sold at Amazon, Walmart and Target stores.  –CNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this story.

Firefighters work to put out a blaze at the Brahmapuram plant landfill in Kochi, India.ReutersCNN      Firefighters in the southern Indian city of Kochi were toiling Tuesday to control toxic fumes from spreading after a landfill burst into flames five days ago, cloaking the area in a thick haze and choking residents.   The towering Brahmapuram landfill in Kerala state is the country’s latest trash mountain to catch fire, causing dangerous heat and methane emissions, and adding to India’s growing climate challenges.   video    She lives near a landfill. Now she has to bathe in salt waterAuthorities advised residents in the city of more than 600,000 to remain indoors or wear N95 face masks if they head outside. Schools were forced to close on Monday as a result of the pollution, officials said.   The blaze broke out last Thursday, according to Kerala’s fire department. The cause has not been established, but landfill fires can be triggered by combustible gases from disintegrating garbage. Images and video released by officials showed workers racing to extinguish the billowing flames that sent thick plumes of toxic smoke rising high into the sky.   While the fire has been largely put out, a thick cloud of smoke and methane gas continues to cover the area, reducing visibility and the city’s air quality, while emitting a lingering, pungent odor.   Some firefighters had fainted from the fumes, the fire department said.   Kerala’s top court said it will take up the case on Tuesday.    A thick, toxic haze has cloaked the area, choking residents. ReutersIndia creates more methane from landfill sites than any other country, according to GHGSat, which monitors emissions via satellites. Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide – but it is a more potent contributor to the climate crisis because it traps more heat.   As part of his “Clean India” initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal, if achieved, could relieve some of the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these enormous dump sites – and help the world lower its greenhouse gas emissions.  SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP/AFP via Getty Imagesvideo    Devotees bathe in sacred river covered in toxic foamBut while India wants to lower its methane output, it hasn’t joined the 150 countries that have signed up to the Global Methane Pledge, a pact to collectively cut global emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Scientists estimate the reduction could cut global temperature rise by 0.2% – and help the world reach its target of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.  India says it won’t join because most of its methane emissions come from farming – some 74% from farm animals and paddy fields versus less than 15% from landfill.   In 2021, India’s environment minister Ashwini Choubey said pledging to reduce the country’s total methane output could threaten the livelihood of farmers and impact the economy. But environmentalists say the country is facing a dire climate challenge from its steaming mounds of trash.India’s trash mountainsBrahmapuram is just one of some 3,000 Indian landfills overflowing with decaying waste and emitting toxic gases.  Commissioned in 2008, the landfill is spread across 16 acres, according to a 2020 report from the International Urban Cooperation, a European Union program.  The landfill receives about 100 metric tons of plastic waste each day, the study added, of which only about 1% is suitable for recycling. The remaining 99% is dumped as a heap at the site, the study said, calling it a “menace for the municipal corporation.”  “The plastic dump at Brahmapuram is increasing in size day by day,” it said. “It has seen several fires over the past few years, thus polluting the air and the environment.”   Despite its growing size and threats, the landfill is not India’s largest. The Deonar dumping ground in the western coastal city of Mumbai, which stands at some 18 stories high, claims the top spot.   Deonar has also seen sporadic fires break out, enveloping about a million residents in the nearby Chembur, Govandi and Mankhurd suburbs.

Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesA trash heap 62 meters high shows the scale of India's climate challengeThere is no formal processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government’s Central Pollution Board. Rag pickers from nearby slums often trek up the towering mounds and scour through the waste for a few cents per day, but they are not trained in properly segregating it.   In some cases, the trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads.  Last year, firefighters worked for days to extinguish flames after a fire broke out at Delhi’s Ghazipur landfill – the capital city’s largest.   Standing at 65 meters (213 feet), it is nearly as tall as the historic Taj Mahal, becoming a landmark in its own right and an eyesore that towers over surrounding homes, affecting the health of people who live there.  And methane emissions aren’t the only hazard that stem from the landfill. Over decades, dangerous toxins have seeped into the ground, polluting the water supply for thousands living nearby.  At Bhalswa, one of Delhi’s other large landfills, residents have complained of deep, painful skin gashes and respiratory issues from years of living near the hazardous mound.   Smoke billows from burning garbage at the Bhalswa landfill in New Delhi, India, April 27, 2022. Adnan Abidi/ReutersIn a 2019 report, the Indian government recommended ways to improve the country’s solid waste management, including formalizing the recycling sector and installing more compost plants in the country.  While some improvements have been made, such as better door-to-door garbage collection and processing of waste, India’s landfills continue to grow in size.   And as the country is expected to soon overtake China as the the world’s most populous nation, climate experts fear time to act upon the issue is running out.

Winter snowBack-to-back winter storms over the past week have overwhelmed several mountain communities in California, leaving residents trapped behind walls of snow and concerned about their dwindling supplies. The Sierra Nevadas could see up to three inches of snow through today, following a weekend that brought as much as 38 inches of snow over a 24-hour period to some areas. In recent days, the snowfall prompted Yosemite National Park to close indefinitely and has buried cars under snow piles that sometimes towered as high as second-story windows. Meanwhile, the Climate Prediction Center is calling for below-average temperatures for much of the rest of the country this week which could bring snow as far south as the southern Appalachians as well as into the mid-Atlantic region.2. January 6Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired newly released footage on his show Monday from the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack that included images of the rioter known as the “QAnon Shaman,” as well as of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died following the attack. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy granted Carlson access to more than 40,000 hours of the Capitol security footage from January 6. CNN and other news organizations have also requested access to the footage. McCarthy’s office said it is still working out the process to make the footage “more widely available” but did not comment further. Separately, former Vice President Mike Pence has asked a judge to block a subpoena for his testimony related to January 6, previously arguing it was “unconstitutional and unprecedented.”  Video Ad FeedbackSource: Mike Pence asks a judge to block a subpoena for his testimony about January 6    02:17   - Source:CNN    3. ChinaGood relations between Beijing and Moscow are essential, China’s foreign minister said today, alarming some US officials. “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations,” Qin Gang said. This comes amid warnings from US officials that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia for its war against Ukraine, which Beijing has denied. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week also cautioned that arming Moscow’s forces would cause China serious problems around the world. Still, Beijing is refusing to acknowledge the nature of the conflict – it has so far avoided calling it an “invasion” – and its diplomatic and economic support for Moscow appears to be increasing.

ImmigrationThe Biden administration is considering reviving the policy of detaining migrant families who cross the border illegally. President Joe Biden had ended the practice when he came into office, but it’s now one of several options administration officials are mulling as they prepare for the end of Title 42 in May – likely resulting in a surge of crossings at the southern border. A source familiar with the deliberations said that family detentions could be limited to a small number of days – an attempt to set the policy apart from the previous administration’s handling of family detentions. Biden, however, has increasingly turned to tougher border enforcement measures in recent months, drawing criticism from immigrant advocates and progressive Democrats who view the changes as a return to some of the policies under former President Donald Trump.5. TwitterTwitter was hit Monday with one of the biggest outages to date under new owner Elon Musk. Some users who attempted to load Twitter were met with an error message or encountered slow-loading pages. In a tweet on Monday, Musk said: “This platform is so brittle (sigh). Will be fixed shortly.” Within about an hour, the issues appeared to have largely been resolved. However, the outage marked the second Twitter glitch in less than a week and the third in under a month. Analysts have noted the company has experienced a range of technical glitches since Musk took over the company and laid off more than half its staff late last year. Some former employees raised concerns that the mass layoffs under Musk could cause the platform to break in big or small ways after workers with knowledge of Twitter’s key systems were ousted.

It will also expand its defense budget 7.2%, marking a slight increase over growth the previous year.  Both figures for the coming year were released at the opening of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, which draws nearly 3,000 delegates to Beijing for the next eight days.  “China’s economy is staging a steady recovery and demonstrating vast potential and momentum for further growth,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang told delegates while delivering a government work report at the opening of the congress on Sunday.  The economy added more than 12 million urban jobs last year, with the urban unemployment rate falling to 5.5%, according to the work report, which emphasized China’s focus on ensuring stable growth, employment and prices amid global inflation and set the GDP target.  China also unveiled its annual military budget for 2023, which will increase 7.2% to roughly 1.55 trillion yuan ($224 billion) in a draft budget report released Sunday morning.  The spending increase marks the second year in a row that the annual hike in military spending has exceeded 7% and tops last year’s 7.1% growth, amid rising geopolitical tensions and a regional arms race. As with other recent years, the figure stays well below the symbolically significant double-digit expansion.   “The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board, develop new military strategic guidance, devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and make well-coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains,” Li’s work report said.  The GDP target and military spending are among the most closely watched in the opening day proceedings, with the GDP target figure in particular being monitored this year as China emerges from its economically draining zero-Covid policy. The new figure appears modest against what some analysts had predicted could be a more robust aim for the year ahead.   The NPC meeting is a key yearly political event that occurs alongside a gathering of China’s top political advisory body, with the events together known as the Two Sessions.   This is the first Two Sessions since Chinese leader Xi Jinping secured a norm-breaking third term atop the Chinese Communist Party hierarchy in October. Xi is set to enter his third term as President, a largely ceremonial title, during the congress.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks during the opening session of China's National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Sunday, March 5.Ng Han Guan/AP    Economic recoveryChina’s GDP expanded by just 3% in 2022, widely missing the official target of “around 5.5%” mainly due to prolonged Covid restrictions. It was the second lowest annual growth rate since 1976, behind only 2020 – when the initial Covid outbreaks nearly paralyzed the economy. In December, after the Communist Party abruptly ended its zero-Covid policy, a massive wave of infections swept across the country, throwing supply chains and factories into chaos. But the disruptions started to fade away in January, and the economic recovery picked up pace last month.  Official data released Wednesday showed China’s factories had their best month in nearly 11 years in February, underscoring how quickly economic activity has bounced back following the end of the Covid exit wave.

Analysts had predicted a difficult track to recovery for China amid global headwinds, which may have also been reflected in the conservative 2023 target of “around 5%” announced Sunday.  The global economy will weaken further this year as rising interest rates and Russia’s war in Ukraine continue to weigh on activity, the International Monetary Fund estimated in January. Global growth will likely slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023.  China is set to release its import and export data for the first two months of this year on Tuesday, which will provide a glimpse into demand for global trade.

Premier Li’s replacement will be formally appointed during the meeting, which runs until March 13.  The new economic team will face the tough task of reviving the Chinese economy as it navigates a growing array of challenges, including sluggish consumption, rising unemployment, a historic downturn in real estate, and increasing tension with the United States over technology sanctions.Military spendingThe 7.2% increase in planned defense spending marks the first time in the past decade that the budget growth rate has increased for three consecutive years, as Beijing continues to modernize and build-up its military, while asserting pressure on Taiwan – the self-governing island democracy the Chinese Communist Party claims as its own despite never having ruled.  China now controls the world’s largest navy by size and continues to advance its fleet of nuclear submarines and stealth fighter jets.   The military budget expanded 7.1% to 1.45 trillion yuan in 2022, compared with 6.8% the previous year. The last year China’s annual defense spending grew by double digits was 2015. The size of this year’s budget is more than double that of ten years ago.  Chinese officials have repeatedly sought to portray their military spending as reasonable relative to other countries like the United States – part of China’s bid to present itself as a peaceful power, despite its aggression in the region including its militarization of the South China Sea and heavy patrolling around Taiwan.   During a press conference Saturday ahead of the opening day, NPC spokesperson Wang Chao said China’s defense budget maintained a “relatively moderate and reasonable growth rate.”  “China’s defense expenditure as a percentage of GDP has remained stable over the years. It remains basically stable, lower than the world average,” Wang said.    CNN’s Mengchen Zhang in Beijing contributed reporting.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under fire from opposition parties to immediately call a wide-ranging public inquiry into allegations of election interference. Sean Kilpatrick/APOttawaCNN      Amid recent allegations that China attempted to meddle in Canada’s 2019 and 2021 elections, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would appoint an independent investigator or rapporteur to help identify and combat foreign interference in Canada’s elections and its democracy.  “We have long known, and an independent report confirmed it again last week, that the Chinese government and other regimes like Iran and Russia have attempted to interfere not just in our democracy but in our country in general, whether it’s our institutions, our businesses, our research facilities or in the daily lives of our citizens,” said Trudeau Monday during a press conference in Ottawa.  Trudeau added that he was taking new investigative steps to safeguard democracy saying foreign actors were looking to foster instability in Canada. But he underscored that multiple reports have so far determined that despite foreign influence attempts, the results of the 2019 federal election and the 2021 election were not impacted.  Trudeau, who is under fire from opposition parties to immediately call a wide-ranging public inquiry into the issue, said that decision would be up to the rapporteur.    “We will ask the independent special rapporteur as one of the first tasks of their mandate to provide the government with a recommendation as to what the appropriate next step should be whether it be an inquiry and investigation or a judicial review and what the scope of that work may be and we will abide by their recommendation,” he said.  China has reacted angrily to allegations of interference in Canadian elections in recent days calling the accusations “total nonsense.”  “It must be pointed out that only those well-versed in spying can fabricate the outrageous lies as reported in the media,” read a statement, in part, from China’s embassy spokesperson in Ottawa. “Only those accustomed to interfering in other countries’ internal affairs are prone to suspicion and preoccupied with playing the trick of feigning innocence and calling others a thief.”  Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on Thursday also denied the allegations, saying during a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly during a G20 meeting, “China never interferes with other countries’ internal politics, and opposes any country interfering other countries’ internal politics.” Calls for public inquiryCanada’s opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, said only a full public inquiry will “get to the bottom” of what actually happened with regards to foreign interference.  “Justin Trudeau has known about this interference for a decade because it was ten years ago that the Trudeau foundation got its $200,000 (Canadian dollar) donation from a Beijing backed donor and ever since we know that the government in Beijing has been trying to influence and support Justin Trudeau,” said Poilievre during a press conference Monday.  Poilievre was referring to a Globe and Mail newspaper report that a foundation named after Trudeau’s father, Pierre, a former prime minister of Canada, had received a $200,000 (Canadian dollar) donation in 2016 from two wealthy Chinese businessmen to fund scholarships and leadership programs.  Poilievre claims those connections go back to 2013 when the younger Trudeau first entered politics.  A spokesperson for Trudeau’s office said that the prime minister withdrew his involvement in any affairs of his father’s namesake foundation when he entered federal politics nearly a decade ago.  In a statement last week, the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation said it would refund the donation in light of recent media reports, and in keeping with its role as an independent, non-partisan charity. The foundation said it would not accept any donation that “may have been sponsored by a foreign government,” according to the statement.  In a government report released last week, Morris Rosenberg, a former public servant charged with looking into attempts to influence Canada’s 2021 election, concluded that foreign actors attempted to meddle but that they did not influence the outcome of the elections.  Rosenberg himself was the CEO of the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation in 2016 when the Chinese businessmen made the donation.

Mark Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners, is photographed in Hong Kong in 2018. Justin Chin/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMark Mobius has said he cannot take his money out of China due to the country’s capital controls, cautioning investors to be “very, very careful” about investing in an economy under a tight government grip.  “I have an account with HSBC in Shanghai. I can’t take my money out. The government is restricting flow of money out of the country,” Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital Partners, told FOX Business in an interview published on March 2.

They don’t say: No, you can’t get your money out. But they say: give us all the records from 20 years of how you made this money … This is crazy.”  Mobius’ comments were circulated on Chinese social media site WeChat at the weekend.  Mobius led emerging market investment at Franklin Templeton Investments for three decades and is known for his bullish view on China. Now, though, he said, he “would be very, very careful” investing in the country.  “The bottom line is that China is moving in a completely different direction than what Deng Xiaoping instituted when they started the big reform program,” he said, referring to the former Chinese leader.

It's just pulling different strings“Now you have a government which is taking golden shares in companies all over China. That means they’re going to try to control all of these companies … So I don’t think it’s a very good picture when you see the government becoming more and more control-oriented in the economy.”  Mobius, who calls himself “the Indiana Jones of Emerging Market investing,” told FOX Business he’s increasing exposure to alternative markets such as India and Brazil.

NIAID-RMLWashingtonCNN      Eight Republican senators are pressing Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to provide them with the raw materials that informed the intelligence community’s latest assessment on the origins of Covid-19, according to a letter they sent Haines on Monday.  “We write to request that you immediately deliver to Congress each IC assessment used and relied upon by the Office of the Director National Intelligence (ODNI) for its consensus publications,” the senators wrote Haines, adding that they are giving Haines until March 20 to provide them with the requested information.   Earlier this year, Congress received a summary of the findings of the intelligence community’s continued investigation into the origins of Covid-19. But the Republican senators – now expressing skepticism about the summary report itself – are specifically requesting “the actual individual IC assessments” instead of a summary of what those assessments found.  The request was prompted by a recent low confidence assessment from the Department of Energy that Covid-19 most likely originated from a laboratory leak in China. The assessment – which matches a moderate confidence finding by the FBI – remains the minority view within the intelligence community, but it has reanimated a debate over the origins of the worldwide pandemic.  “DNI Haines currently faces a critical decision – whether to be transparent with Congress and stop obstructing the agencies involved in the IC assessment from turning over their results or continue to hide key details from the American people and their elected officials. There are many questions about ODNI’s process that must be answered. Was it tainted by outside experts who had conflicts of interest?  Why was Congress not updated in real time with new assessments? I will continue to seek the truth for Kansans and all Americans,” Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican who signed the letter, said in a statement to CNN.

Biden administration officials and intelligence sources have repeatedly said that the conclusions are simply inconclusive, pointing to the lack of information that the Chinese have shared on the origins of the virus.“Congress should be able to review the independent evaluations without filters, ambiguity or interpretations of the intelligence. There is clear bipartisan support in Congress to make these assessments available immediately in full as evident by the unanimous March 1, 2023 Senate passage of the COVID-19 Origin Act to declassify information related to the origin of COVID-19,” the senators wrote.  The senators who signed the letter, in addition to Marshall, include Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Joni Ernst, Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. Susan Collins, Sen Marsha Blackburn, Sen Roger Wicker and Sen Mike Braun.   CNN has asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for comment.Request for detailed briefingThe senators are also requesting a detailed briefing from ODNI about the process behind analyzing material across government on the topic. They specifically want to know how ODNI synthesized and processed the information, particularly material which did not come from the intelligence community such as information from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They also want to know if each IC assessment was given equal weight and how “any differences in analytic judgment were fully considered and brought to the attention of the White House.”  As they dig into this inquiry, the senators claim that when the intelligence community was tasked by the White House with doing a 90-day review to evaluate the origins of Covid-19 in March 2021, the decision to rely on the intelligence community – instead of entities across government – “all but eliminated the U.S. government’s ability to openly share assessment results with any meaningful transparency.”  The third line of questions from the senators is related to the credentials and experience of the individuals involved in the ODNI summary.  “Finally, we are concerned that the world-class credentials of the scientists and other experts of the IC elements was not matched by the ODNI reviewers,” the letter writes. “If ODNI does not make all IC individual assessments available to congress, then it will be important for ODNI to provide full descriptions of the credentials, training, experience and job titles about each individual involved in ODNI’s synthesis of IC assessments, to include all detailees, individuals on interagency personnel agreements, unpaid consultants, federal contractors and political appointees.”  This general view shows the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province on February 3, 2021, as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus, visit. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAssessment Covid-19 leaked from Chinese lab is a minority view within US intel community, sources sayA congressional source familiar with the letter explained that the Department of Energy has some of the best scientists in the world and expressed concern about the ability of anyone without those credentials being able to accurately summarize their findings.  The senators write that the investigation into the origins of the pandemic have been “obfuscated” by the Chinese communist government’s lack of cooperation.   Administration officials have said that they agree with that sentiment, but they have also said that the US government does not have a consensus on the origins of the virus.  “What the president wants is facts. He wants the whole government designed to go get those facts. And that’s what we’re doing and we’re just not there yet,” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters last month. “And when we’re there yet, and if we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress – than we’re going to do that.”  A report from 2021 issued by ODNI revealed that the National Intelligence Council, along with four other unidentified agencies, assessed with low confidence that the initial Covid-19 infection “was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus.”  But the Republican senators argue that “ODNI has failed to be transparent with Congress and the American people” about their process of reviewing the different assessments.  “It is time for the Administration to declassify the assessments, make the information available to the public, and start building the public’s trust through transparency,” they wrote.   The congressional source familiar with the letter echoed those sentiments.  “We have sources that know that what was represented in these summaries – not just this one, but in the larger classified report – that there is reason to question the completeness and objectivity of how the information has been representative,” the source said.

Video Ad FeedbackJill Biden reacts to Nikki Haley's call for presidential competency test    00:31   - Source:CNNCNN      First lady Dr. Jill Biden warned parts of East Africa are “on the precipice” of famine as the region is dealing with a severe drought, threatening livelihoods and the ability of families to feed their children.  Her comments came in a series of wide-ranging interviews during a recent five-day trip to Africa that were part of “CNN Primetime: Jill Biden Abroad.” In the interviews, she shared her thoughts about the 2024 presidential campaign, weighed in on the classified documents found at their Wilmington, Delaware, home, and talked about life as first lady, including relationships with the women who held the role in the past.  As the Bidens prepare for a possible 2024 presidential campaign, the first lady pushed back on concerns about President Joe Biden’s age, citing his recent travel schedule as reflective of his stamina.  “How many 30-year-olds could travel to Poland, get on the train? Go nine more hours, go to Ukraine, meet with President (Volodymyr) Zelensky?” she said. “So, look at the man. Look what he’s doing. Look what he continues to do each and every day.”  Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has called for politicians over the age of 75 to take mental competency tests, which the first lady called, “Ridiculous.” Asked if her husband, who would be 82 at his inauguration if he’s reelected, would ever take such a test, she said, “We would never even discuss something like that.”  During an extensive sit-down with CNN, Jill Biden said she “absolutely” believes her husband will run for reelection in 2024, saying she’s “all for it.” But the first lady also left an opening for her husband should he decide against a run.“It’s Joe’s decision,” she said. “And we support whatever he wants to do. If he’s in, we’re there. If he wants to do something else, we’re there too.”  The first lady said her family has not had one definitive sit-down meeting to discuss a reelection bid as has been typical for the Biden clan in the past, saying instead there’s been a series of rolling conversations with their children and grandchildren.  She said the wave of investigations into her son, Hunter Biden, a frequent target for Republicans, has not affected the family’s thinking about 2024.  “I love Hunter, and I’ll support him … in any way I can. And that’s how I look at things,” she said.  The first lady also weighed in for the first time on the revelation that classified documents were found at the president’s Wilmington residence and a private office in Washington, DC, which prompted the Justice Department to assign a special counsel to investigate the matter.  CNNvideo    Hear what first lady thinks about Biden's reelection plans“I was really surprised. We had no idea,” she said, noting the documents at their Wilmington home were in the garage. “Believe me, Arlette, I haven’t been, I mean, I don’t have time to go through, you know, the boxes in the garage. We had no idea they were even down there.” The first lady in Africa The first lady traveled to Africa for visits to Namibia and Kenya to emphasize the United States’ commitment to the region at a time when Russia and China have made in-roads on the continent.  “America wants to keep reassuring the countries and the leaders of Africa, like - ‘We didn’t forget you.’ You know, we were isolationist, pretty much for the last four years of the last administration,” she said in a critique of former President Donald Trump. “We want to say, ‘Hey, we’re back.’”  It marked her sixth trip to Africa after having traveled to the continent five times as second lady. She focused on delivering messages about women’s empowerment, youth engagement, and the need to preserve democracy.  Biden also highlighted programs funded through PEPFAR, the Bush-era initiative focused on fighting HIV/AIDS around the globe, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.  On her final day in Kenya, the first lady looked to shine a spotlight on the severe drought affecting the region. She traveled to the rural village of Lositeti in Kajiado County to tour a health clinic offering services to the community.   Nearly 500 patients, many of them children, received treatment that day, including medical and malnutrition check-ups and nutritional assistance, according to the US Agency for International Development.  “Livestock is dying. There’s no water. There’s no grass. There are no crops. Mothers can’t lactate. They’re not able to feed their children. It’s a major problem,” she said. “I’m here before it gets any worse to try to create awareness and say, ‘How can we find solutions for these major problems?’”  In Kenya, officials say more than 4 million people have insufficient access to food, with that figure expected to rise above 5 million in the coming months.  The first lady noted the US provides 70% of financial assistance to the drought-plagued region and urged other countries to pitch in with more aid.  “Everybody has to come together to make sure that these people aren’t dying because of the drought,” she said. “Because believe me … they have nothing. They have nothing and their children are malnourished.”  In 2011, Biden visited the same region to highlight the impact of drought and famine. She toured the country’s largest refugee camp in Dadaab, where more than 100,000 Somali refugees fled to amid famine and conflict.   “We’re right on the precipice I think of a famine,” she told CNN. “We’re right on the edge. We need to act now.” Reflecting on Jimmy Carter and other first ladies The first lady also reflected on the legacy of former President Jimmy Carter, who recently started receiving hospice care.  “I think he’ll be remembered as a great humanitarian, I mean, all that he has done to help people,” she said. “He never stopped. He never stopped helping Americans, whether it was Habitat for Humanity, building homes, or going into communities, traveling the world helping people all over.”  The president and first lady visited with Carter and his wife, former first Lady Rosalynn Carter, at their Plains, Georgia, home in 2021. Dr. Biden said the two men “talked politics the whole time and what was going on, and they have a real ease in with one another,” and she praised the couple’s seven-decades long marriage.  “She’s so much a part of his life,” she said. “It’s a really strong partnership.”  Biden said Rosalynn Carter has “always been very supportive, as have quite frankly, most of the first ladies. “  “If you ever need anything or you want to talk or if there’s something … on your mind, or if I can help you in some way, they’ve all been great,” she said.  Asked if she’s spoken with former first lady Melania Trump, she responded: “Not Melania.”  The first lady said she plans to offer advice to future first spouses, saying “if they ask, of course, I mean, it’s a very small number, at this point, of women, and I think we have to support one another.”Insight into the Bidens’ marriageBiden also offered a window into her marriage, saying she maintains a “good balance” in the types of insight and advice she offers her husband.  “Certainly I tell him stories, and I have things that I’ve seen and things that people want and where their challenges are,” she said. “So, it’s not that I’m like weighing in. It’s like, let me tell you what I saw or what I heard, or what people are saying to me.”  “It’s in that context because I’m out every day. I’m in the classroom. I’m out, you know, somewhere in the United States,” she added. “I think it’s a good balance really.”  Biden said her husband helps her understand there are different ways of looking at issues and viewpoints.  “Well, sometimes I don’t, I may not see things from his perspective. Let’s just put it that way. And so, he offers both sides,” she said. “I’m always better like ‘This person feels this way.” ‘Yes, but this is why they,’ – you know, he’s very good at that – understanding why people feel the way they do. He understands both sides, which is part of his strength.”  Biden, who has been married to the president for nearly 46 years, has long said she’s not an adviser to her husband, but she is his most trusted partner and wields a significant amount of influence within the White House.   The couple speaks often via text and FaceTime throughout the day as they both maintain busy work and travel schedules with the first lady saying the president “calls a lot.”  Biden said she “said a lot of prayers” when her husband made a highly secretive to Kyiv, Ukraine – an active war zone where the US military has no control – last month.  “I was really worried. But you know, one thing, and I have to say this with all my heart. One thing that I truly believe in is the strength of our military, and how everything was so planned out, and the Secret Service, and what an amazing job they did, in pulling off the trip, and keeping my husband safe,” she said.A unique first lady Biden plays a unique role as first lady, the first to hold a full-time paid job outside of the White House. She teaches English and writing full time at Northern Virginia Community College, a job she also held for her eight years as second lady when her husband was vice president.   From her perch at the White House, she has spent time advocating for education issues, helping military families through her “Joining Forces” initiative and working to end cancer through the “Cancer Moonshot.” The first lady is one of the Biden administration’s most often used surrogates at events across the country.  “I think it’s all so interesting and really fulfilling for me as, as a teacher, and as a woman, you know, to see the empowerment of other young women in them getting education,” she said when asked how she balance the two roles. “There’s nothing I can ever give up.”  “I really feel like I’ve grown so much in this role, because of the opportunities that I’ve been given whether it’s traveling to Africa, or whether it’s traveling to Nebraska,” she added. “I see so many different communities and reach out to people in all walks of life.”  Biden said her experiences as an educator and first lady have helped her build connections with people during her travels abroad, which has included trips to 10 countries in her first two years in the White House.   “Joe tends towards policy,” she said. “I try to, you know, go in a little bit maybe a softer direction.”  While in Africa, Biden held events with the first ladies of Namibia and Kenya, telling CNN it’s important to cultivate those types of relationships abroad.  “One thing Joe taught me is that all politics is personal, and that’s true because once you have these connections, I think you can call on someone when you need help, when you need to be lifted up, when you can support programs,” she said.

Burak Kara/Getty ImagesEditor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.Abu Dhabi, UAECNN      The devastating earthquake that hit Turkey on February 6 killed at least 45,000 people, rendered millions homeless across almost a dozen cities and caused immediate damage estimated at $34 billion – or roughly 4% of the country’s annual economic output, according to the World Bank.    But the indirect cost of the quake could be much higher, and recovery will be neither easy nor quick.   The Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation estimates the total cost of the quake at $84.1 billion, the lion’s share of which would be for housing, at $70.8 billion, with lost national income pegged at $10.4 billion and lost working days at $2.91 billion.    “I do not recall… any economic disaster at this level in the history of the Republic of Turkey,” said Arda Tunca, an Istanbul-based economist at PolitikYol.    Turkey’s economy had been slowing even before the earthquake. Unorthodox monetary policies by the government caused soaring inflation, leading to further income inequality and a currency crisis that saw the lira lose 30% of its value against the dollar last year. Turkey’s economy grew 5.6% last year, Reuters reported, citing official data.   Economists say those structural weaknesses in the economy will only get worse because of the quake and could determine the course of presidential and parliamentary elections expected in mid-May.     Still, Tunca says that while the physical damage from the quake is colossal, the cost to the country’s GDP won’t be as pronounced when compared to the 1999 earthquake in Izmit, which hit the country’s industrial heartland and killed more than 17,000. According to the OECD, the areas impacted in that quake accounted for a third of the country’s GDP.    The provinces most affected by the February 6 quake represent some 15% of Turkey’s population. According to the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, they contribute 9% of the nation’s GDP, 11% of income tax and 14% of income from agriculture and fisheries.    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan meets with people in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey on Wednesday.Presidential Press Office/ReutersErdogan's political fate may rest on his response to the earthquake “Economic growth would slow down at first but I don’t expect a recessionary threat due to the earthquake,” said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koc University in Istanbul. “I don’t expect the impact on (economic) growth to be more than 1 to 2 (percentage) points.”    There has been growing criticism of the country’s preparedness for the quake, whether through policies to mitigate the economic impact or prevent the scale of the damage seen in the disaster.     How Turkey will rehabilitate its economy and provide for its newly homeless people is not yet known. But it could prove pivotal in determining President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s political fate, analysts and economists say, as he seeks another term in office.  Strong fiscal position  The government’s 2023 budget, released before the earthquake, had planned for increased spending in an election year, foreseeing a deficit of 660 billion liras ($34.9 billion).    The government has already announced some measures that analysts said were designed to shore up Erdogan’s popularity, including a near 55% increase in the minimum wage, early retirement and cheaper housing loans.    Economists say that Turkey’s fiscal position is strong. Its budget deficit, when compared to its economic output, is smaller than that of other emerging markets like India, China and Brazil. That gives the government room to spend.    “Turkey starts from a position of relative fiscal strength,” said Selva Bahar Baziki of Bloomberg Economics. “The necessary quake spending will likely result in the government breaching their budget targets. Given the high humanitarian toll, this would be the year to do it.”     Quake-related public spending is estimated at 2.6% of GDP in the short run, she told CNN, but could eventually reach as high as 5.5%.   Governments usually plug budget shortfalls by taking on more debt or raising taxes. Economists say both are likely options. But post-quake taxation is already a touchy topic in the country, and could prove risky in an election year.    After the 1999 quake, Turkey introduced an “earthquake tax” that was initially introduced as a temporary measure to help cushion economic damage, but subsequently became a permanent tax.    There has been concern in the country that the state may have squandered those tax revenues, with opposition leaders calling on the government to be more transparent about what happened to the money raised. When asked in 2020, Erdogan said the money “was not spent out of its purpose.” Since then, the government has said little more about how the money was spent.     “The funds created for earthquake preparedness have been used for projects such as road constructions, infrastructure build-ups, etc. other than earthquake preparedness,” said Tunca. “In other words, no buffers or cushions have been set in place to limit the economic impacts of such disasters.”    The Turkish presidency didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.    Analysts say it’s too early to tell precisely what impact the economic fallout will have on Erdogan’s prospects for re-election.    TOPSHOT - Rescuers and civilians look for survivors under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Kahramanmaras, close to the quake's epicentre, the day after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the country's southeast, on February 7, 2023. - Rescuers in Turkey and Syria braved frigid weather, aftershocks and collapsing buildings, as they dug for survivors buried by an earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred near the quake's epicentre between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million where entire blocks now lie in ruins under gathering snow.

In a December poll by Turkish research firm MetroPOLL, 52.1% of respondents didn’t approve of his handling of his job as president. A survey a month earlier found that a slim majority of voters would not vote for Erdogan if an election were held on that day.    Two polls last week, however, showed the Turkish opposition had not picked up fresh support, Reuters reported, citing partly its failure to name a candidate  and partly its lack of a tangible plan to rebuild areas devastated by the quake.  Voter defection The majority of the provinces worst affected by the quake voted for Erdogan and his ruling AK Party in the 2018 elections, but in some of those provinces, Erdogan and the AK Party won with a plurality of votes or a slim majority.   Those provinces are some of the poorest in the country, the World Bank says.   Research conducted by Demiralp as well as academics Evren Balta from Ozyegin University and Seda Demiralp from Isik University, found that while the ruling AK Party’s voters’ high partisanship is a strong hindrance to voter defection, economic and democratic failures could tip the balance.     “Our data shows that respondents who report being able to make ends meet are more likely to vote for the incumbent AKP again,” the research concludes. “However, once worsening economic fundamentals push more people below the poverty line, the possibility of defection increases.”    This could allow opposition parties to take votes from the incumbent rulers “despite identity-based cleavages if they target economically and democratically dissatisfied voters via clear messages.”    For Tunca, the economic fallout from the quake poses a real risk for Erdogan’s prospects.   “The magnitude of Turkey’s social earthquake is much greater than that of the tectonic one,” he said. “There is a tug of war between the government and the opposition, and it seems that the winner is going to be unknown until the very end of the elections.”    Nadeen Ebrahim and Isil Sariyuce contributed to this report. This article has been corrected to say that the research, not the survey, was conducted by the academics. The digest Sub-Saharan African countries repatriate citizens from Tunisia after ‘shocking’ statements from country’s president Sub-Saharan African countries including Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea and Gabon, are helping their citizens return from Tunisia following a controversial statement from Tunisian President Kais Saied, who has led a crackdown on illegal immigration into the North African country since last month.   Background: In a meeting with Tunisia’s National Security Council on February 21, Saied described illegal border crossing from sub-Saharan Africa into Tunisia as a “criminal enterprise hatched at the beginning of this century to change the demographic composition of Tunisia.” He said the immigration aims to turn Tunisia into “only an African country with no belonging to the Arab and Muslim worlds.” In a later speech on February 23, Saied maintained there is no racial discrimination in Tunisia and said that Africans residing in Tunisia legally are welcome. Authorities arrested 58 African migrants on Friday after they reportedly crossed the border illegally, state news agency TAP reported on Saturday. Why it matters: Saied, whose seizure of power in 2021 was described as a coup by his foes, is facing challenges to his rule at home. Reuters on Sunday reported that opposition figures and rights groups have said that the president’s crackdown on migrants was meant to distract from Tunisia’s economic crisis.  Iranian Supreme Leader says schoolgirls’ poisoning is an ‘unforgivable crime’ Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday said that the poisoning of schoolgirls in recent months across Iran is an “unforgivable crime,” state-run news agency IRNA reported. Khamenei urged authorities to pursue the issue, saying that “if it is proven that the students were poisoned, the perpetrators of this crime should be severely punished.”   Background: Concern is growing in Iran after reports emerged that hundreds of schoolgirls had been poisoned across the country over the last few months. On Wednesday, Iran’s semi-official Mehr News reported that Shahriar Heydari, a member of parliament, said that “nearly 900 students” from across the country had been poisoned so far, citing an unnamed, “reliable source.”  Why it matters: The reports have led to a local and international outcry. While it is unclear whether the incidents were linked and if the students were targeted, some believe them to be deliberate attempts at shutting down girls’ schools, and even potentially linked to recent protests that spread under the slogan, “Women, Life, Freedom.” Iran to allow further IAEA access following discussions – IAEA chief Iran will allow more access and monitoring capabilities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), agency Director General Rafael Grossi said at a press conference in Vienna on Saturday, following a trip to the Islamic Republic. The additional monitoring is set to start “very, very soon,” said Grossi, with an IAEA team arriving within a few days to begin reinstalling the equipment at several sites.    Background: Prior to the news conference, the IAEA released a joint statement with Iran’s atomic energy agency in which the two bodies agreed that interactions between them will be “carried out in the spirit of collaboration.” Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said he hopes the IAEA will remain neutral and fair to Iran’s nuclear energy program and refrain from being affected “by certain powers which are pursuing their own specific goals,” reported Iranian state television Press TV on Saturday. Why it matters: Last week, a restricted IAEA report seen by CNN said that uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels have been found at an Iranian nuclear facility, as the US warned that Tehran’s ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating. The president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Mohammad Eslami, rejected the recent IAEA report, which detected particles of uranium enriched to 83.7% at the Fordow nuclear facility in Iran, saying there has been ‘“no deviation” in Iran’s peaceful nuclear activities. Around the region From Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities/FacebookA new sphinx statue has been discovered in Egypt – but this one is thought to be Roman.    The smiling sculpture and the remains of a shrine were found during an excavation mission in Qena, a southern Egyptian city on the eastern banks of the River Nile.    The shrine had been carved in limestone and consisted of a two-level platform, Mamdouh Eldamaty, a former minister of antiquities and professor of Egyptology at Ain Shams University said in a statement Monday from Egypt’s ministry of tourism and antiquities. A ladder and mudbrick basin for water storage were found inside.    The basin, believed to date back to the Byzantine era, housed the smiling sphinx statue, carved from limestone.   Eldamaty described the statue as bearing “royal facial features.” It had a “soft smile” with two dimples. It also wore a nemes on its head, the striped cloth headdress traditionally worn by pharaohs of ancient Egypt, with a cobra-shaped end or “uraeus.”   A Roman stela with hieroglyphic and demotic writings from the Roman era was found below the sphinx.    The professor said that the statue may represent the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth Roman emperor who ruled from the year 41 to 54, but noted that more studies are needed to verify the structure’s owner and history.   The discovery was made in the eastern side of Dendera Temple in Qena, where excavations are still ongoing.    Sphinxes are recurring creatures in the mythologies of ancient Egyptian, Persian and Greek cultures. Their likenesses are often found near tombs or religious buildings.   It is not uncommon for new sphinx statues to be found in Egypt. But the country’s most famous sphinx, the Great Sphinx of Giza, dates back to around 2,500 BC and represents the ancient Egyptian Pharoah Khafre.

Park rangers show the tiger carcasses in Thong Pha Phum National Park, Kanchanaburi province, west of the capital Bangkok.Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation/DNPBangkok, ThailandCNN      A court in western Thailand on Monday sentenced five poachers to prison terms of five years each for killing a female tiger and her cub in a national park last year.  The provincial court ruled the five men broke conservation laws by killing the protected animals in Thong Pha Phum National Park, Kanchanaburi province, before skinning their carcasses and smoking their bones to prepare them for sale on the illicit market.  Park rangers made the discovery in January last year and seized the tiger parts. Images distributed by officials and taken in the jungle showed the skins of two flayed tigers. Bones and carcass parts were also seen in pictures taken nearby.  The court rejected the men’s argument that they had killed the tigers in revenge for attacks on livestock, ruling they “should have felt protective of nature” given that they lived in a community near the forest.  Tigers are an endangered species with only about 4,500 remaining in the wild, according to the the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Though their numbers have increased in recent years, WWF says fewer than 200 of the big cats remain in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries across Thailand.  Poaching, one of the biggest threats to tigers’ survival, is driven largely by demand in China and Vietnam for their bones, skins and other body parts used in traditional medicine.  The safety and effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine is still heavily debated in China, where it has both adherents and skeptics.   Though many of the remedies in TCM have been in use for hundreds of years, critics argue that there is often little verifiable scientific evidence or peer reviewed studies to support their supposed benefits.  Thong Pha Phum National Park Chief Charoen Jaichon welcomed the court ruling.   “I’m happy that justice has been delivered,” he told CNN on Tuesday. “This is a strong warning to any illegal hunters in Thailand’s national parks.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Beijing enjoys a close relationship with Moscow, and the Chinese government has been purchasing Russian energy and supplying machinery, electronics, base metals, vehicles, ships and aircraft, throwing the Kremlin an economic lifeline.    In recent months, tensions between the United States and China have increased as the countries compete for dominance of the microchip industry and argue over tariffs, US support for Taiwan and potential spy balloons.   Dimon said JPMorgan Chase is taking an active role in improving the relationship between the United States and China by advising and engaging with both governments on keeping cordial relations. He’s hoping that “cooler heads prevail” but he doesn’t believe a business solution exists to ease growing disputes. While JPMorgan Chase does a fair share of business with Beijing, it’s the government, not private enterprise, that has to smooth tensions, he said.   “We probably should have started resetting this 10 years ago,” he said. The US government has to sit down and have a “very serious conversation with the Chinese government,” he said.   Dimon added that he believes the war in Ukraine could continue for years to come. A soft landingOn the home front, Dimon is still holding out hope for the possibility that the Federal Reserve can execute a soft landing — lowering interest rates while avoiding recession. But overall, his outlook remains cloudy.   “A mild recession is possible, a harder recession is possible,” he said Monday. “I think there’s a good chance that inflation will come down, but not enough by the fourth quarter — the Fed may actually have to do more,” he said.   Dimon did note that the US consumer is still very healthy: Home prices and wages are high, households still have more money in their bank accounts than they did before the pandemic and they’re still spending it.   Consumers are in great shape, he said. “But that’s going to end at some point.”   Still, even if America does enter a recession, he said, consumers are much stronger and will be able to better withstand a downturn than they were in 2008.

The ex-president and the Florida governor’s escalating shadow campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to exacerbate the already growing antipathy among grassroots conservatives for being Ukraine’s arsenal of democracy.  This should worry the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has profusely thanked Americans for their multi-billion dollar generosity while warning he will keep asking for more.  Video Ad Feedback'If I were Donald Trump, I'd be really worried': Gergen on possible DeSantis showdown    02:39   - Source:CNNA bitter Republican primary that turns on the isolationist sentiment of the party’s “Make America Great Again” wing could produce a nominee, and possibly a 47th president, who could shelve the assurance of Joe Biden that Americans will stand by Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”   There are already early signs of ebbing public support for Biden’s repeated aid and arms packages for Ukraine a year after Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally, has warned against a “blank check” for Ukraine. The reaction of the ex-president’s proteges in the GOP-controlled House to Biden’s daring secret visit to Kyiv last month suggests that the 2024 Republican nominee will surely cater to a base that believes the US should spend its money securing its own borders instead of Ukraine’s and that Biden cares more for foreigners than Americans.  Donald J. Trump (L) and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.Getty ImagesTrump and DeSantis stake out sharpest preview yet of possible 2024 showdownRecent polling helps explain the GOP positioning on Ukraine. Support for the US providing weapons to the country has decreased compared with last spring, according to an AP-NORC survey conducted in late January, and that decline was sharper among Republicans – down to 39% from 53% in May 2022.   Trump has no love lost for Zelensky, after what he misleading described as their “perfect” 2019 phone call, in which the then-president tried to use US military aid to extort his counterpart into opening an investigation into Biden. The incident led to Trump’s first impeachment. More recently, in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Trump seemed eager to rekindle his genuflecting relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom much of the world now regards as a war criminal. And the need to defend a democracy that is under attack is a foreign concept to Trump at home, let alone abroad.  “Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled. … I will get the problem solved. And I will get it solved in rapid order and it will take me no longer than one day,” Trump said. “I know exactly what to say to each of them,” he added, before hinting at a potential strategy of siding with the aggressor in the war by reminding his audience, “I got along very well with Putin.”  DeSantis, whose foreign policy views remain mostly a mystery, has not been as clear as Trump on what he would do in Ukraine. After all, he’s not even a declared candidate yet, despite fresh signs he is heading in that direction. But he appeared to try to catch up with Trump when warning in a recent Fox News interview that the Biden administration had “no clear, strategic objective identified” in Ukraine and that it was not in US interests to get involved in a proxy war with China there, after the White House warned Beijing could start sending arms to Russia.  This is an evolution from his position as a congressman in 2014 and 2015, when he strongly supported arming Ukraine to fight Russia, CNN’s KFile reported.   Getty ImagesGOP 2024 hopefuls divided over US role in Ukraine warPutin, of course, is listening. The Russian leader appears to be digging in for a forever war in Ukraine – where he has already been entrenched since 2014 after the illegal annexation of Crimea. Even hints that a new Republican president would cut Kyiv loose would play into his apparent belief that, eventually, the West will get tired and splinter. After all, Germany only agreed to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine after Biden also agreed that more advanced US M1 Abrams tanks would also be shipped to the battlefield.  And even if Kyiv prevails in the conflict, or reaches a currently unlikely peace deal with Moscow, its future could rely on being a de facto NATO protectorate armed with Western weapons and even security guarantees from major US or European powers that some future Republican presidents, judging by current rhetoric, might be loath to honor.  Not every Republican agrees with Trump or DeSantis on Ukraine. Many of the key committee chairmen in the House, for instance, back current or even increased aid and military hardware for Ukraine and support its call for F-16 fighter jets that Biden has declined to send. And several potential Republican primary candidates also support the US effort. Former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who launched her campaign last month and paints herself as a would-be scourge of strongmen leaders like Putin and China’s Xi Jinping, tweeted last year: “This isn’t just a war for Ukraine, this is a war for freedom.”  But presidential primaries have a habit of defining a party’s positions at the extremes – and with Trump and DeSantis being seen as the current favorites, their rivals may come under increasing pressure to fall into line to ensure their own political viability.  Ukraine’s primary focus is on the battle, amid fresh signs that its desperate resistance in the city of Bakhmut may be about to be broken.  But the possibility of changing political conditions in the United States as a new White House campaign begins means that Zelensky’s desperation for more weapons and ammunition to eject Putin’s forces from Ukraine will only become more urgent.Trump sees an opening to go after DeSantis on UkraineTrump made clear in his appearance at CPAC that if he gets the chance to confront Biden in a repeat of the 2020 election, he will accuse the Democrat of leading the planet to the brink of disaster.  “I am the only candidate who can make this promise, I will prevent, very easily, World War III,” Trump said in a speech riddled with falsehoods. “We are going to have World War III, by the way, if something doesn’t happen fast.”  The former president is in some ways repeating his 2016 tactic of warning about America’s exposure to foreign wars. He’s trying to fan fatigue over US arms-length involvement in Ukraine as he did over the long conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.  And he drove home another familiar criticism of presidents who fixate on foreign policy by showing up in East Palestine, Ohio – at the site of a chemical spill after a freight train derailment – while Biden was visiting Europe last month.  “I sincerely hope that when your representatives and all of the politicians get here, including Biden, they get back from touring Ukraine, that he’s got some money left over,” Trump said.  CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported Monday that the former president also sees an opening to target DeSantis over his calls as a congressional candidate in 2012 to privatize some social benefits by suggesting he is not sufficiently in line with the GOP base in stopping financial and military aid to Ukraine.  “We are never going back to a party that wants to give unlimited money to fight foreign endless wars but demands we cut veteran benefits and retirement benefits at home,” Trump said during his CPAC speech.  Video Ad Feedback'Absolute fiction': Daniel Dale fact-checks Trump's CPAC speech    04:04   - Source:CNN    DeSantis and his foreign policy views are still a work in progressIn his new book “The Courage to be Free,” published last week, the Florida governor doesn’t mention Ukraine. But he does criticize the mantra laid out by President George W. Bush in his second inaugural address – that “the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the liberty in other lands.” DeSantis writes that this “messianic impulse—that the US had both the right and the obligation to promote democracy, by force, if necessary, around the world — was grounded in Wilsonian moralism, not in a clear-eyed view of American interests.”  This perspective seems incompatible with Biden’s characterization of the US’ support for Ukraine as part of a vital national interest to protect democracy.  Marco Bello/Reuters/FILEDeSantis agenda -- and potential campaign platform -- in the spotlight as Florida lawmakers return to workBut DeSantis is tapping into a familiar seam of opinion.  The sense among many voters that Bush overreached and led Americans into disastrous years-long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was not just a motivating force that helped the rise of Trump’s populist nationalism in the Republican Party. President Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 2008 warning that he was against “dumb wars.”  There is some reluctance to get involved in foreign wars again among American voters on the right and left. A group of Democratic members of Congress, for example, last year called for negotiations to end the war, despite the lack of indications that Putin has any willingness to withdraw his troops. But they were criticized by their colleagues for such a move.  And Iraq and Afghanistan are not a clean analogy for Ukraine – whatever Republican candidates might say – since Biden has scrupulously avoided the involvement of any US forces, as he seeks to head off a dangerous direct clash with nuclear-armed Moscow.  Biden’s need to shore up public support for an extended commitment to Ukraine was one reason why he went to Ukraine to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion.  “When united, Americans of all political backgrounds decided that they would step up. The American people know it matters. Unchecked aggression is a threat to all of us,” Biden told Zelensky in Kyiv.  “You remind us that freedom is priceless; it’s worth fighting for for as long as it takes. And that’s how long we’re going to be with you, Mr. President: for as long as it takes.”  But with the battle on the edge of Europe not looking like it will end any time soon, Biden may have to make that case on the debate stage with a Republican nominee next year – which suggests the clock maybe ticking for Ukraine.

Video Ad FeedbackListen to who Republicans at CPAC are most excited to see    02:20   - Source:CNNEditor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.CNN      It was 10 years ago that “Florida Man” emerged as a buzzy Twitter account documenting outlandish headlines from the Sunshine State, but the meme can be traced back to the 1500s, during the days of Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León’s supposed quest for the fountain of youth in Florida.   In the Washington Post last year, Julio Capó Jr. and Tyler Gillespie tracked the origins of the meme through centuries of colonial and state history, and concluded, “The internet turned Florida Man into a Southern Gothic figure of indulgence, decadence and questionable decisions.”  With the 2024 presidential campaign about to ramp up, Republicans are facing the prospect of having two Florida men as frontrunners. One is the former president, Donald Trump, who despite two impeachments and a sea of legal troubles, still retains a strong hold on the party’s base from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and vowed Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference to be the agent of “retribution” on behalf of aggrieved voters.  The other is the state’s culture-warring governor, Ron DeSantis, the so-far undeclared candidate who grew up on Florida’s Gulf Coast. He is talking up his new book and winning the support of many wealthy donors as early polls show he is the strongest Republican challenger to Trump.   Trump has road-tested a variety of derogatory nicknames for DeSantis, while the governor has only pushed back obliquely. Yet within their party, Trump and DeSantis are aligned — and at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum from yet another Florida man, former Gov. Jeb Bush, who was the early leader of the Republican field for 2016.  “In this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand,” DeSantis declares in his book, sounding a note that Trump could well agree with. The governor, fresh from his battle with Disney, implied that he is best suited to oppose “large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes.”  At CPAC, Trump said, the GOP is “never going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove and Jeb Bush.”  How did DeSantis rise to potentially challenge Trump? Justin Sayfie, a former adviser to Jeb Bush and partner at a lobbying firm, attributes “his rapid national ascent” to “the early pandemic in 2020 when he became a hero to millions for filling a vacuum of leadership at a time of global crisis and uncertainty.”  Clay Jones“Vulnerable older adults in Florida witnessed how he prioritized their health and safety by prohibiting transfers of patients infected with the coronavirus from hospitals into long-term care facilities, unlike in New York,” Sayfie wrote. “Parents of Florida schoolchildren witnessed how he focused on keeping schools open, so students wouldn’t fall behind in their learning. Small-business owners witnessed how he battled to get and keep businesses open, so they and their employees could continue to feed their families during the pandemic.”   And the flood of tourists to Florida took note. Moreover, DeSantis has a knack for picking issues that unite Republicans and divide Democrats, Sayfie observed.   Reading the governor’s new book, Jay Parini noted that “everywhere … one senses his rage against political correctness. He rails, on nearly every page, about ‘the woke agenda’ that he sees permeating almost every level of life in America…”  “The title of this book must surely be ironic: ‘The Courage to Be Free.’ DeSantis is all about the restriction of freedoms wherever possible. He wants to cancel librarians who allow kids to read certain Black or LGBTQ writers and to fire tenured professors in the state university system who teach ‘woke’ ideas. He wants to restrict the rights of women seeking abortions and those of LGBTQ people seeking to live their lives. He hopes to punish corporations, such as the Walt Disney Company, for criticizing his policies.” Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook In Parini’s view, DeSantis is “a chilly man, with a heart of ice and — like so many politicians on both the right and left these days — full of resentments, grudges and the urge to destroy anyone who doesn’t agree with him. … I shudder to think what he might do if handed the presidential bully pulpit.”   The first primaries won’t start until early next year, so there’s still plenty of time for GOP contenders from states other than Florida to jostle for the nomination.

In the day-to-day swirl of life, adults may set those queries aside, but they remain front of mind for many children.   This weekend, CNN Opinion launched the first in a series of videos featuring questions from kids and answers from some of the world’s foremost experts. In a collaboration with the Templeton Foundation, CNN’s Kirsi Goldynia and Mackenzie Happe produced a video in which Anthea, a 9-year-old Brooklyn student, asked theoretical physicist Brian Greene, “What existed before the universe?” We hope you’ll watch Greene’s reply — and let us know what you think.  ‘Crushing’ student loans“Student loan debt is crushing, and it has exploded in the last few decades,” observed Jill Filipovic. Many of the more than 43 million Americans who collectively owe $1.75 trillion dollars cheered when President Joe Biden announced a plan to forgive as much as $20,000 per borrower.   But six Republican-led states and two debt holders have filed lawsuits challenging the policy, claiming it’s “beyond the scope of Biden’s power; he’s using Covid as a pretext, they say, for a law that should be approved by Congress,” Filipovic noted. Supreme Court justices heard arguments in the case Tuesday.  “The Republican talking point,” she added “is that Biden’s plan is a massive taxpayer giveaway, and that he cunningly used Covid as an excuse to push through a policy Congress would have never approved. So it’s worth asking Republican politicians: Why won’t Congress act to relieve student loan debt — even if it means making the uber-wealthy and large corporations pay more in taxes — and improve the economic and personal futures of so many young people?”Lab leakLisa Benson/GoComics.comThe US Department of Energy lent new credibility to the theory that the virus that causes Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, saying last week that it has “low confidence” in that assessment. Then FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency thinks the pandemic “most likely” resulted from a “potential lab incident in Wuhan.”  Peter Bergen noted that “we may never truly know how the Covid-19 virus originated because the Chinese government didn’t allow international inspectors into Wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in December 2019.”  Covid has killed 6.8 million people, including 1.1 million Americans. “And yet the United States hasn’t had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened,” Bergen wrote. A “Covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn’t work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic.”Fox NewsThe release of Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch’s deposition in a legal filing as part of a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems has ignited a new debate over the role of Fox News.   “Murdoch acknowledged that some Fox News hosts — Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo and former host Lou Dobbs — endorsed lies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen; and that he gave Jared Kushner confidential information about President Joe Biden’s ads and debate strategy in 2020,” David Zurawik noted.   “Murdoch’s deposition clearly shows the hypocrisy, dishonesty and lack of anything resembling journalistic ethics at the top and in front of the camera at Fox News.”   Zurawik considered how this will affect the network’s future, writing, “For one thing, Fox was never a news network to begin with. Whereas a news network is a platform built on the premise that one of its first obligations is providing citizens with vetted information that they can use to be free and self-governing, Fox was founded in 1996 as a political platform and run by Roger Ailes, a political operative.”  Now, Zurawik argued, “It’s become so much deeper culturally. Fox News is a world view, a lifestyle, a way of seeing the world, a 24/7 warm bath of false nostalgia and aggrievement primarily for older adults — some of whom are likely feeling left behind or threatened by the changes in American life.”Lori LightfootFour years ago, Lori Lightfoot won nearly 74% of the vote for Chicago’s mayor. On Tuesday, she failed to advance to the runoff, having gained the support of just 17% of voters, David Axelrod pointed out.    “Crime — a perennial issue that has bedeviled mayors for decades — is far and away the top concern of Chicago voters. And while she could claim some progress in the past year over 2021, Lightfoot was widely considered a failure on the critical issue of public safety,” Axelrod wrote. But there were other issues. “Lightfoot’s fall is a more complicated story that goes to a clenched-fist, go-it-alone style of leadership that made consensus hard to build and drove many who should have been her allies away.” Bare minimum MondaysHow’s your Sunday going? According to TikTok creator Marisa Jo Mayes, many people spend the day putting together “insanely long to-do lists” and feeling “paralyzing” pressure to get things ready for the start of the work week.   “As a result,” Holly Thomas wrote, “we hit Mondays primed for stress and unable to focus or engage properly with work. This sense of chaotic unease ripples across the week, costing us more in terms of productivity and vitality than any amount of effort can compensate for. Bare minimum Monday devotees instead make the conscious decision to coast on the first day of the working week, thus conserving their energy. ‘It was like some magic spell came over me,’ Mayes explains. ‘I felt better. I wasn’t overwhelmed, and I actually got more done than I expected.’”  As a millennial, Thomas feels for Mayes and other GenZers grasping for solutions to overwork. “The first several years of my working life passed in a haze of fluorescent office light and breakfasts consumed any time between 4 and 10 am consisting entirely of caffeine pills, Pepsi Max and coffee. I made less money each month than I’d be charged in rent a decade later and conducted my business and relationships in a permanent state of adrenalized exhaustion. …”  “Unlike millennials, who were at least motivated by the hope that it would all be worth it in the end, there’s no such light on the horizon for Gen Z.” Scott AdamsWalt Handelsman/Tribune Content AgencyNewspapers across the country announced they would stop running “Dilbert” after the comic strip’s creator Scott Adams ranted about Black Americans as a “hate group” and told White people to “get the hell away” from them.   Adams complained he was being cancelled, but, as Dean Obeidallah wrote, “this is not ‘cancel culture,’ but ‘consequence culture’ where people are rightly held accountable for their words and actions…”  “Adams is just a prime example of the era we live in, a time when some people will say racist or bigoted remarks and then play the victim card, alleging that they have been victimized by ‘cancel culture’ in hopes of silencing their critics.”  “In the minds of people like him, freedom of expression means being free to spew all the hate-filled garbage they want and in response, requiring the rest of us to bite our tongues. But that’s not how free speech works. People will and should push back against bigotry.”Black History MonthDarrin Bell/King Features SyndicateWinning the NCAA individual all-around title in gymnastics left Onnie Willis Rogers “elated” two decades ago. “But it was a particular kind of joy, tinged with the frustration often felt by the Black athlete who excels in a sport where they are one of only a very few.”   “Even during my four years at UCLA, an urban school with a sizable Black population, I was the only Black female gymnast on my team,” she wrote. “But I’ve noticed something different about gymnasts today, and perhaps you have, as well. There are more Black and brown athletes in the sport than ever before. And they are turning out to be a force to be reckoned with…”  “This year, Fisk University is the first HBCU to have an NCAA gymnastics team — an entire team of Black and brown girls doing gymnastics. It’s radical. It’s transformative. And as Black History Month draws to a close, it’s a reminder of what is possible.”  For more:  Julian Zelizer: Uncovering the forgotten history of slavery in the NorthPeniel E.

And those children were, as a colleague unnervingly put it, ‘the lucky ones.’ Over 2 million Yemeni children are not in school, with far too many of them populating the vast child soldiery one must daily maneuver.”  “Everywhere is the ache of terminal starvation — the nightmarish effects of which include the inability to regulate body temperature, to produce tears when weeping and then a final decline into ghastly, emaciated, lethargic death. All of which I saw, and which Yemenis endure daily: children’s lives snuffed out by globally sanctioned neglect.”  Against this backdrop, Sadoski wrote, “To stand callously by and watch indignity lumped upon depravity heaped upon agony is utterly inhuman. Nevertheless, the wheels are steadily in motion for that outcome, as global aid for Yemen is in staggering decline.”Don’t missBill Bramhall/Tribune Content AgencyFrida Ghitis: The toxic brew poisoning American societySara Stewart: ‘Cocaine Bear’ may actually be a game changerQ&A with Odessa Rae: How Putin’s nemesis finds humor even in the darknessMarion Messmer: The other nuclear threat you might have missed from Putin’s speechCandace Rondeaux: The higher Wagner’s notorious boss rises, the harder he may fallTom Vilsack: How the USDA plans to protect families losing SNAP pandemic benefitsAND…Drew Sheneman/Tribune Content Agency    Physical 100ZooYoung/NetflixJeff Yang is closer to Physical zero than 100, but he’s still hooked on “Physical 100,” the Netflix reality show from South Korea.   “Despite claiming to be a search to find the ultimate physical specimen,” he noted, the show was “was more of an acknowledgment that no such single ideal exists; that different types of bodies excel at different types of achievement, and that all kinds of builds deserve respect.”  “Losers cheered on survivors; winners reached their hands out to help up the fallen; and the symbolic act of trying your hardest delivered the only real victory that matters — victory over fear and self-doubt.”  “As another fan-favorite contestant, 47-year-old MMA fighter Choo Sung-hoon, said after losing in the semifinal round, ‘I wanted to prove that people in their 40s and 50s around the world, like me, can beat young people if they work hard.

Video Ad FeedbackCNN's Richard Quest interviews South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo    04:16   - Source:CNNSeoul, South KoreaCNN      South Korea doesn’t need nuclear arms to deter the threat from North Korea, the country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in an exclusive interview with CNN – even as public opinion swings the other way amid Asia’s accelerating arms race.Several recent public surveys “definitely showed that we should re-arm ourselves. In nuclear capability terms, (the surveys say) we should go farther,” Han told CNN anchor and business editor-at-large Richard Quest during a sit-down in Seoul.  One such poll, released last February, found that 71% of more than 1,300 respondents in the country were in favor of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons – a once-unthinkable idea that has become increasingly mainstream in the past decade, with rising tensions in the Korean Peninsula and dwindling confidence in South Korea toward US protection.  However, Han insisted the country has enough in its arsenal to stave off North Korea’s “preposterous ambitions” – and that developing nuclear capabilities was not “the right way.”  In this handout photo released by the South Korean Defense Ministry, a missile is fired during a U.S. and South Korea joint training exercise to fire a ground-to-ground missile on May 25, 2022 in East Coast, South Korea. South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty ImagesWhy are South Koreans losing faith in America's nuclear umbrella?“We have built up a quite adequate level of our deterrence capabilities in close cooperation with the United States,” he said, adding that the government had “put a lot of emphasis” on strengthening its deterrence since President Yoon Suk Yeol took power last year.   “We should work together with the international community… to put a lot of continuous pressure on North Korea to denuclearize,” he said. “We would like to let North Korea know that developing and advancing nuclear capabilities will not guarantee the peace and prosperity in their country.”  Relations between North and South Korea have worsened in recent years as Pyongyang ramped up its weapons  program, firing a record number of missiles last year – including one that flew over Japan, the first time North Korea had done so in five years, prompting international alarm.  And for months, the US and international observers have warned that North Korea appears to be preparing for its first underground nuclear test since 2017. The country’s dictator Kim Jong Un also intensified his rhetoric last year; he declared his intention to build the “world’s most powerful” nuclear force, warned adversaries that North Korea was fully prepared for “actual war,” vowed to “never give up” nuclear weapons and dismissed the possibility of negotiating denuclearization.  Korean Central TV/ReutersExclusive: North Korea a 'clear and present danger,' says South Korean Foreign MinisterIn response, the US and its allies South Korea and Japan have stepped up their own military drills and cooperation. Yoon, who has publicly taken a tough stance against North Korea, even raised the prospect of South Korea building its own nuclear arsenal, saying in January it could “deploy tactical nuclear weapons or possess its own nukes.”  And despite Han voicing opposition to such a plan, he too emphasized South Korea’s preparedness in confronting its nuclear-armed neighbor – as well as its openness for further talks, under certain conditions.  “We are not disarming ourselves against North Korea,” he said. “But we are not closing the dialogue channel with North Korea … as long as North Korea is abstaining from their very strong nuclear ambitions.”  Video Ad FeedbackKim Jong Un calls for 'exponential' increase in country's nuclear arsenal    02:14   - Source:CNN    China’s roleHan also discussed China’s role in the region, saying the superpower was “not the country it used to be,” in past decades that ushered in economic reforms and liberalization.  “China is a huge and important global player,” he said. “Including Korea, I think many countries would like to see (China) be more compliant with global rules.”  He added that though China “will contribute a lot in solving global problems,” the country often doesn’t meet the “expectations a lot of countries would like to have – for example, we hoped that China would be more aggressive and more active in reducing tensions in the Korean Peninsula.”  For years, China has been North Korea’s biggest trading partner and an economic lifeline, with Pyongyang isolated from much of the world.

In January, US and Japanese ministers warned of the “ongoing and accelerating expansion of (China’s) nuclear arsenal.” Just days later, Japan’s prime minister expressed concern over China’s military activities in the East China Sea, and the launch of ballistic missiles over Taiwan that landed in waters near Japan in August.  China’s military buildup, aggressive foreign policy and multiple disputed territorial claims haven’t gone unnoticed in Seoul – where attitudes toward Beijing are fast souring.  In the 2022 survey on South Korean nuclear armament, more than half of respondents said China would be the biggest threat to the country in 10 years, and many cited “threats other than North Korea” behind their support for a domestic nuclear arsenal.  Han acknowledged that Seoul was closely watching these territorial disputes.   “Peace in the Taiwan Strait is also very important for the security and peace of the Korean Peninsula,” he said. And though South Korea is “committed” to the one-China policy, he said, “at the same time, we (expect) China to be more rule-based, not behaving as a country … being condemned by international community.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

He was 61.   The actor was hospitalized after suffering a brain aneurysm in mid-February, Lago told CNN at the time.   Sizemore “passed away peacefully in his sleep” at Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, with his two sons and his brother, Paul Sizemore, by his side, Lago said in a statement released on behalf of the family.   “I am deeply saddened by the loss of my big brother Tom,” Paul Sizemore said in the statement. “He was larger than life. He has influenced my life more than anyone I know. He was talented, loving, giving and could keep you entertained endlessly with his wit and storytelling ability. I am devastated he is gone and will miss him always.”  On Monday, Sizemore’s family said doctors informed them there was “no further hope” and recommended “end of life decision” due to the condition of his health, according to a statement released. “We are asking for privacy for his family during this difficult time and they wish to thank everyone for the hundreds of messages of support, and prayers that have been received. This has been a difficult time for them.”   Tom Sizemore poses for a portrait at The Collective and Gibson Lounge Powered by CEG, during the Sundance Film Festival, on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP)Victoria Will/Invision/APTom Sizemore's family deciding end of life matters, rep saysBorn in Detroit, Sizemore made a name for himself in Hollywood playing tough guys.   He had an early, small role in the 1989 Oliver Stone film “Born on the Fourth of July” and scored his television break playing Sgt. Vinnie Ventresca in the ABC series “China Beach.”   Sizemore followed that with performances in various films, including “Point Break” in 1991, “True Romance” in 1993, “Natural Born Killers” in 1994 and “Strange Days” in 1995.   His costarring role as Bat Masterson in Kevin Costner’s western “Wyatt Earp” earned Sizemore acclaim. He went on to other major roles in “Pearl Harbor” and “Black Hawk Down,” both released in 2001.    He was perhaps best known for his role as Sgt. Mike Horvath in the 1998 World War II film “Saving Private Ryan.”   Sizemore recently appeared in the Netflix series “Cobra Kai” and the independent supernatural film, “Impuratus.”    Sizemore (front left) had a prominent role in the 1998 film 'Saving Private Ryan.'DreamWorks/Everett Collection    Off screen woes and recoverySizemore’s fame on screen was at times overshadowed by coverage of his life off screen.   Battling substance abuse for years, in 2003 he was convicted of domestic abuse against former girlfriend and Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. He had other legal run-ins and appeared on the VH1 series “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew” in 2010.   That same year he told CNN’s Larry King that he had been addicted to cocaine, heroin and meth.   Sizemore later talked about starring in the comedy series “Barbee Rehab” in a 2022 interview with Decider and was asked if he had some hesitancy in taking on the role.   “There was some, but it was so goofy and so not like rehab that I got over it,” Sizemore said, laughing at the time. “Plus, it wasn’t about drugs. It’s about obsessions and compulsions and… Barbees!”   In the same interview, Sizemore reflected on seeing magic in movies like “The Wizard of Oz” as a child and later as a teen watching “Taxi Driver.”    “I saw that movie every week for, like, two months when it was playing in the theater. I saw it eleven weeks in a row,” Sizemore said. “That’s when I first started thinking, ‘Whatever that is they’re doing up there, I want to be part of it. I want to do that.’”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Entertainment  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Family members hold a remembrance event for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in Kuala Lumpur on March 3, 2018. Lai Seng Sin/ReutersFamilies of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which disappeared mysteriously nearly nine years ago, called on the Malaysian government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane.  The fate of flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.  In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to $70 million if it found the plane. But its operation came up short.  The firm’s search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year $135 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane.  On Sunday, Voice370 – a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane – said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the Malaysian government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful.  “Ocean Infinity, over the last 12 months have made real progress working with many people to further understand… the events in 2014,” Voice370 said in a statement, following a memorial event to mark the ninth year since MH370’s disappearance.  “Ultimately, this has greatly improved their chances of conducting a successful search.”  A Chinese maritime vessel moves through the search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight in  2014.Greg Wood/Pool/Getty ImagesOcean Infinity and Malaysia’s Transport Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  But in a message to families read out at the memorial event, Transport Minister Anthony Loke vowed not to “close the book” on MH370, adding that due consideration would be given to future searches if there was “new and credible information” on the aircraft’s potential location.  Debris confirmed or believed to be from the MH370 aircraft has washed up along the African coast and on islands in the Indian Ocean.  Malaysian investigators previously drew no conclusion about what happened aboard the flight, but did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft had been deliberately taken off course.

Nikki Haley speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, DC, on March 3, 2023.Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesCNN      Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley in an address before key GOP donors Saturday took aim at her own political party for enabling what she describes as excessive government spending, according to a copy of her speech obtained by CNN.   At a private retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, hosted by the conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth, Haley was expected to take a shot at former President Donald Trump, who was not invited to the event and was instead to headline the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, DC, on Saturday.   “I know there’s a Republican candidate out there who you did not invite to this conference,” reads the speech by Haley, who has been reluctant to attack Trump directly since launching her 2024 presidential campaign last month. “I appreciate being one you did invite.”  Former South Carolina Gov. and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley arrives for an event launching her candidacy for the US presidency February 15, 2023 in Charleston, South Carolina.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesNikki Haley's first days in GOP 2024 race preview the Trump balancing act awaiting other contendersTrump was the only major 2024 hopeful not invited to the Club for Growth event. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is moving toward launching his own presidential bid, spoke at the retreat on Thursday. Haley spoke at both the Club for Growth retreat and CPAC, which this year featured key allies of Trump and several of his family members. After Haley spoke at CPAC on Friday, she was heckled by several Trump supporters, who chanted, “We love Trump!” as she posed for photos with attendees.   Haley’s speech in Florida on Saturday did not name any Republican politicians, but the former UN ambassador and twice-elected former South Carolina governor was expected to call out the group of 158 House Republicans who she said had “voted to keep this ‘gateway drug’ of wasteful spending” in the form of earmarks.   “Isn’t the Club for Growth known for supporting primary challenges to squishy Republicans? If Republicans don’t stand for fiscal sanity and economic freedom, no one will,” Haley was expected to say, adding, “I’m not afraid to call out my fellow Republicans.”  Haley’s speech criticized Democrats, including President Joe Biden, whom she accused of pushing “socialist” policies and “wasting taxpayer money,” echoing her campaign trail rhetoric since launching her bid. But her address also panned some Republicans, who she said were just as much to blame for the spending.   “Obviously, the socialist left hates economic freedom. But so do some of our fellow Republicans,” the presidential candidate was expected to say. “They bad-mouth capitalism almost as much as Elizabeth Warren. You’ll never hear that from me.  “It’s insane that Joe Biden has gotten a free pass for this socialist spending spree. But a big part of the reason is that Republicans haven’t held the line – or even upheld the conservative market principles they claim to support.”  Haley’s focus on government spending came the day after Trump released a plan calling for significant new federal investments, including building up to 10 new “Freedom Cities” on unused federal land and asking Congress to provide “baby bonuses” to help young parents raise their children. Trump also called for investing in the development of flying cars, saying, “I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility.”  This story and headline have been updated with additional information.

Video Ad FeedbackListen to who Republicans at CPAC are most excited to see    02:20   - Source:CNNEditor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.CNN      It was 10 years ago that “Florida Man” emerged as a buzzy Twitter account documenting outlandish headlines from the Sunshine State, but the meme can be traced back to the 1500s, during the days of Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León’s supposed quest for the fountain of youth in Florida.   In the Washington Post last year, Julio Capó Jr. and Tyler Gillespie tracked the origins of the meme through centuries of colonial and state history, and concluded, “The internet turned Florida Man into a Southern Gothic figure of indulgence, decadence and questionable decisions.”  With the 2024 presidential campaign about to ramp up, Republicans are facing the prospect of having two Florida men as frontrunners. One is the former president, Donald Trump, who despite two impeachments and a sea of legal troubles, still retains a strong hold on the party’s base from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and vowed Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference to be the agent of “retribution” on behalf of aggrieved voters.  The other is the state’s culture-warring governor, Ron DeSantis, the so-far undeclared candidate who grew up on Florida’s Gulf Coast. He is talking up his new book and winning the support of many wealthy donors as early polls show he is the strongest Republican challenger to Trump.   Trump has road-tested a variety of derogatory nicknames for DeSantis, while the governor has only pushed back obliquely. Yet within their party, Trump and DeSantis are aligned — and at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum from yet another Florida man, former Gov. Jeb Bush, who was the early leader of the Republican field for 2016.  “In this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand,” DeSantis declares in his book, sounding a note that Trump could well agree with. The governor, fresh from his battle with Disney, implied that he is best suited to oppose “large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes.”  At CPAC, Trump said, the GOP is “never going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove and Jeb Bush.”  How did DeSantis rise to potentially challenge Trump? Justin Sayfie, a former adviser to Jeb Bush and partner at a lobbying firm, attributes “his rapid national ascent” to “the early pandemic in 2020 when he became a hero to millions for filling a vacuum of leadership at a time of global crisis and uncertainty.”  Clay Jones“Vulnerable older adults in Florida witnessed how he prioritized their health and safety by prohibiting transfers of patients infected with the coronavirus from hospitals into long-term care facilities, unlike in New York,” Sayfie wrote. “Parents of Florida schoolchildren witnessed how he focused on keeping schools open, so students wouldn’t fall behind in their learning. Small-business owners witnessed how he battled to get and keep businesses open, so they and their employees could continue to feed their families during the pandemic.”   And the flood of tourists to Florida took note. Moreover, DeSantis has a knack for picking issues that unite Republicans and divide Democrats, Sayfie observed.   Reading the governor’s new book, Jay Parini noted that “everywhere … one senses his rage against political correctness. He rails, on nearly every page, about ‘the woke agenda’ that he sees permeating almost every level of life in America…”  “The title of this book must surely be ironic: ‘The Courage to Be Free.’ DeSantis is all about the restriction of freedoms wherever possible. He wants to cancel librarians who allow kids to read certain Black or LGBTQ writers and to fire tenured professors in the state university system who teach ‘woke’ ideas. He wants to restrict the rights of women seeking abortions and those of LGBTQ people seeking to live their lives. He hopes to punish corporations, such as the Walt Disney Company, for criticizing his policies.” Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook In Parini’s view, DeSantis is “a chilly man, with a heart of ice and — like so many politicians on both the right and left these days — full of resentments, grudges and the urge to destroy anyone who doesn’t agree with him. … I shudder to think what he might do if handed the presidential bully pulpit.”   The first primaries won’t start until early next year, so there’s still plenty of time for GOP contenders from states other than Florida to jostle for the nomination.

In the day-to-day swirl of life, adults may set those queries aside, but they remain front of mind for many children.   This weekend, CNN Opinion launched the first in a series of videos featuring questions from kids and answers from some of the world’s foremost experts. In a collaboration with the Templeton Foundation, CNN’s Kirsi Goldynia and Mackenzie Happe produced a video in which Anthea, a 9-year-old Brooklyn student, asked theoretical physicist Brian Greene, “What existed before the universe?” We hope you’ll watch Greene’s reply — and let us know what you think.  ‘Crushing’ student loans“Student loan debt is crushing, and it has exploded in the last few decades,” observed Jill Filipovic. Many of the more than 43 million Americans who collectively owe $1.75 trillion dollars cheered when President Joe Biden announced a plan to forgive as much as $20,000 per borrower.   But six Republican-led states and two debt holders have filed lawsuits challenging the policy, claiming it’s “beyond the scope of Biden’s power; he’s using Covid as a pretext, they say, for a law that should be approved by Congress,” Filipovic noted. Supreme Court justices heard arguments in the case Tuesday.  “The Republican talking point,” she added “is that Biden’s plan is a massive taxpayer giveaway, and that he cunningly used Covid as an excuse to push through a policy Congress would have never approved. So it’s worth asking Republican politicians: Why won’t Congress act to relieve student loan debt — even if it means making the uber-wealthy and large corporations pay more in taxes — and improve the economic and personal futures of so many young people?”Lab leakLisa Benson/GoComics.comThe US Department of Energy lent new credibility to the theory that the virus that causes Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, saying last week that it has “low confidence” in that assessment. Then FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency thinks the pandemic “most likely” resulted from a “potential lab incident in Wuhan.”  Peter Bergen noted that “we may never truly know how the Covid-19 virus originated because the Chinese government didn’t allow international inspectors into Wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in December 2019.”  Covid has killed 6.8 million people, including 1.1 million Americans. “And yet the United States hasn’t had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened,” Bergen wrote. A “Covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn’t work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic.”Fox NewsThe release of Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch’s deposition in a legal filing as part of a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems has ignited a new debate over the role of Fox News.   “Murdoch acknowledged that some Fox News hosts — Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo and former host Lou Dobbs — endorsed lies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen; and that he gave Jared Kushner confidential information about President Joe Biden’s ads and debate strategy in 2020,” David Zurawik noted.   “Murdoch’s deposition clearly shows the hypocrisy, dishonesty and lack of anything resembling journalistic ethics at the top and in front of the camera at Fox News.”   Zurawik considered how this will affect the network’s future, writing, “For one thing, Fox was never a news network to begin with. Whereas a news network is a platform built on the premise that one of its first obligations is providing citizens with vetted information that they can use to be free and self-governing, Fox was founded in 1996 as a political platform and run by Roger Ailes, a political operative.”  Now, Zurawik argued, “It’s become so much deeper culturally. Fox News is a world view, a lifestyle, a way of seeing the world, a 24/7 warm bath of false nostalgia and aggrievement primarily for older adults — some of whom are likely feeling left behind or threatened by the changes in American life.”Lori LightfootFour years ago, Lori Lightfoot won nearly 74% of the vote for Chicago’s mayor. On Tuesday, she failed to advance to the runoff, having gained the support of just 17% of voters, David Axelrod pointed out.    “Crime — a perennial issue that has bedeviled mayors for decades — is far and away the top concern of Chicago voters. And while she could claim some progress in the past year over 2021, Lightfoot was widely considered a failure on the critical issue of public safety,” Axelrod wrote. But there were other issues. “Lightfoot’s fall is a more complicated story that goes to a clenched-fist, go-it-alone style of leadership that made consensus hard to build and drove many who should have been her allies away.” Bare minimum MondaysHow’s your Sunday going? According to TikTok creator Marisa Jo Mayes, many people spend the day putting together “insanely long to-do lists” and feeling “paralyzing” pressure to get things ready for the start of the work week.   “As a result,” Holly Thomas wrote, “we hit Mondays primed for stress and unable to focus or engage properly with work. This sense of chaotic unease ripples across the week, costing us more in terms of productivity and vitality than any amount of effort can compensate for. Bare minimum Monday devotees instead make the conscious decision to coast on the first day of the working week, thus conserving their energy. ‘It was like some magic spell came over me,’ Mayes explains. ‘I felt better. I wasn’t overwhelmed, and I actually got more done than I expected.’”  As a millennial, Thomas feels for Mayes and other GenZers grasping for solutions to overwork. “The first several years of my working life passed in a haze of fluorescent office light and breakfasts consumed any time between 4 and 10 am consisting entirely of caffeine pills, Pepsi Max and coffee. I made less money each month than I’d be charged in rent a decade later and conducted my business and relationships in a permanent state of adrenalized exhaustion. …”  “Unlike millennials, who were at least motivated by the hope that it would all be worth it in the end, there’s no such light on the horizon for Gen Z.” Scott AdamsWalt Handelsman/Tribune Content AgencyNewspapers across the country announced they would stop running “Dilbert” after the comic strip’s creator Scott Adams ranted about Black Americans as a “hate group” and told White people to “get the hell away” from them.   Adams complained he was being cancelled, but, as Dean Obeidallah wrote, “this is not ‘cancel culture,’ but ‘consequence culture’ where people are rightly held accountable for their words and actions…”  “Adams is just a prime example of the era we live in, a time when some people will say racist or bigoted remarks and then play the victim card, alleging that they have been victimized by ‘cancel culture’ in hopes of silencing their critics.”  “In the minds of people like him, freedom of expression means being free to spew all the hate-filled garbage they want and in response, requiring the rest of us to bite our tongues. But that’s not how free speech works. People will and should push back against bigotry.”Black History MonthDarrin Bell/King Features SyndicateWinning the NCAA individual all-around title in gymnastics left Onnie Willis Rogers “elated” two decades ago. “But it was a particular kind of joy, tinged with the frustration often felt by the Black athlete who excels in a sport where they are one of only a very few.”   “Even during my four years at UCLA, an urban school with a sizable Black population, I was the only Black female gymnast on my team,” she wrote. “But I’ve noticed something different about gymnasts today, and perhaps you have, as well. There are more Black and brown athletes in the sport than ever before. And they are turning out to be a force to be reckoned with…”  “This year, Fisk University is the first HBCU to have an NCAA gymnastics team — an entire team of Black and brown girls doing gymnastics. It’s radical. It’s transformative. And as Black History Month draws to a close, it’s a reminder of what is possible.”  For more:  Julian Zelizer: Uncovering the forgotten history of slavery in the NorthPeniel E. Joseph: This enduring crime continues to haunt America’s efforts for racial justice    Yemen’s childrenThe actor Thomas Sadoski recently returned from a trip to war-torn Yemen, in conjunction with his work for the humanitarian organization War Child. He wrote that malnutrition affects as many at 95% of children in some areas.   “The resulting stunted physical development had me convinced that I was in a kindergarten classroom when in fact I was meeting with eight and nine-year-olds. And those children were, as a colleague unnervingly put it, ‘the lucky ones.’ Over 2 million Yemeni children are not in school, with far too many of them populating the vast child soldiery one must daily maneuver.”  “Everywhere is the ache of terminal starvation — the nightmarish effects of which include the inability to regulate body temperature, to produce tears when weeping and then a final decline into ghastly, emaciated, lethargic death. All of which I saw, and which Yemenis endure daily: children’s lives snuffed out by globally sanctioned neglect.”  Against this backdrop, Sadoski wrote, “To stand callously by and watch indignity lumped upon depravity heaped upon agony is utterly inhuman. Nevertheless, the wheels are steadily in motion for that outcome, as global aid for Yemen is in staggering decline.”Don’t missBill Bramhall/Tribune Content AgencyFrida Ghitis: The toxic brew poisoning American societySara Stewart: ‘Cocaine Bear’ may actually be a game changerQ&A with Odessa Rae: How Putin’s nemesis finds humor even in the darknessMarion Messmer: The other nuclear threat you might have missed from Putin’s speechCandace Rondeaux: The higher Wagner’s notorious boss rises, the harder he may fallTom Vilsack: How the USDA plans to protect families losing SNAP pandemic benefitsAND…Drew Sheneman/Tribune Content Agency    Physical 100ZooYoung/NetflixJeff Yang is closer to Physical zero than 100, but he’s still hooked on “Physical 100,” the Netflix reality show from South Korea.   “Despite claiming to be a search to find the ultimate physical specimen,” he noted, the show was “was more of an acknowledgment that no such single ideal exists; that different types of bodies excel at different types of achievement, and that all kinds of builds deserve respect.”  “Losers cheered on survivors; winners reached their hands out to help up the fallen; and the symbolic act of trying your hardest delivered the only real victory that matters — victory over fear and self-doubt.”  “As another fan-favorite contestant, 47-year-old MMA fighter Choo Sung-hoon, said after losing in the semifinal round, ‘I wanted to prove that people in their 40s and 50s around the world, like me, can beat young people if they work hard. I’m sorry I lost. But old men all over the world! We can still do it!’”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    OpinionAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Apple supplier Foxconn is on the hunt for semiconductor and EV deals in India    			By Juliana Liu, CNN		  Updated  2:48 AM EST, Sat March 4, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackZuckerberg critical of Apple and App Store practices    04:04   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      Apple supplier Foxconn says it is seeking Indian partners to cooperate in areas such as chips and electric vehicles, as its chief executive wrapped up a visit to the country.  Taiwan’s Foxconn has been looking to expand its operations in the South Asian giant after suffering severe supply disruptions in China last year. The firm bounced back from the disruptions early this year.   “India is a country with a large population,” Young Liu, the company’s chairman and CEO, said in a Saturday statement. “My trip this week supported Foxconn’s efforts to deepen partnerships … and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles.”  “Foxconn will continue to communicate with local governments to seek the most beneficial development opportunities for the company and all stakeholders,” he added.  The company, best known for making Apple    (AAPL)’s iPhones, is one of the world’s biggest contract makers of electronics. It’s now expanding into other areas including electric vehicles.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)Jeff Chiu/APIs the iPhone's 'Made in India' era about to begin?Liu did not specify any investment spending in India during his trip, which included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  The company already has factories in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  On Friday, the investment promotion office of the southern Indian state of Karnataka said Foxconn had announced a major deal there and that 300 acres of land had been allocated for a facility. The investment will generate 100,000 jobs over 10 years in the state, it said.  According to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources, the company plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, to make iPhone parts.  India has emerged as an attractive potential alternative to China for the likes of Apple. One of India’s top ministers, Piyush Goyal, said in January that Apple wants to ramp up its production in the South Asian country to a quarter of its overall total from between 5% and 7% now.  For years, Apple had relied on a vast manufacturing network in China to mass produce iPhones, iPads and other popular products. But its dependence on the country was tested last year by Beijing’s strict zero-Covid strategy, which was rapidly dismantled last December.  Apple devices are currently manufactured in India by Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, which are all Taiwanese companies.  – CNN’s Diksha Madhok contributed reporting RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Camp toy store pleads for help after Silicon Valley Bank collapse    Mar 11, 2023  Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

Video Ad FeedbackCNN's Richard Quest interviews South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo    04:16   - Source:CNNSeoul, South KoreaCNN      South Korea doesn’t need nuclear arms to deter the threat from North Korea, the country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in an exclusive interview with CNN – even as public opinion swings the other way amid Asia’s accelerating arms race.Several recent public surveys “definitely showed that we should re-arm ourselves. In nuclear capability terms, (the surveys say) we should go farther,” Han told CNN anchor and business editor-at-large Richard Quest during a sit-down in Seoul.  One such poll, released last February, found that 71% of more than 1,300 respondents in the country were in favor of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons – a once-unthinkable idea that has become increasingly mainstream in the past decade, with rising tensions in the Korean Peninsula and dwindling confidence in South Korea toward US protection.  However, Han insisted the country has enough in its arsenal to stave off North Korea’s “preposterous ambitions” – and that developing nuclear capabilities was not “the right way.”  In this handout photo released by the South Korean Defense Ministry, a missile is fired during a U.S. and South Korea joint training exercise to fire a ground-to-ground missile on May 25, 2022 in East Coast, South Korea. South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty ImagesWhy are South Koreans losing faith in America's nuclear umbrella?“We have built up a quite adequate level of our deterrence capabilities in close cooperation with the United States,” he said, adding that the government had “put a lot of emphasis” on strengthening its deterrence since President Yoon Suk Yeol took power last year.   “We should work together with the international community… to put a lot of continuous pressure on North Korea to denuclearize,” he said. “We would like to let North Korea know that developing and advancing nuclear capabilities will not guarantee the peace and prosperity in their country.”  Relations between North and South Korea have worsened in recent years as Pyongyang ramped up its weapons  program, firing a record number of missiles last year – including one that flew over Japan, the first time North Korea had done so in five years, prompting international alarm.  And for months, the US and international observers have warned that North Korea appears to be preparing for its first underground nuclear test since 2017. The country’s dictator Kim Jong Un also intensified his rhetoric last year; he declared his intention to build the “world’s most powerful” nuclear force, warned adversaries that North Korea was fully prepared for “actual war,” vowed to “never give up” nuclear weapons and dismissed the possibility of negotiating denuclearization.  Korean Central TV/ReutersExclusive: North Korea a 'clear and present danger,' says South Korean Foreign MinisterIn response, the US and its allies South Korea and Japan have stepped up their own military drills and cooperation. Yoon, who has publicly taken a tough stance against North Korea, even raised the prospect of South Korea building its own nuclear arsenal, saying in January it could “deploy tactical nuclear weapons or possess its own nukes.”  And despite Han voicing opposition to such a plan, he too emphasized South Korea’s preparedness in confronting its nuclear-armed neighbor – as well as its openness for further talks, under certain conditions.  “We are not disarming ourselves against North Korea,” he said. “But we are not closing the dialogue channel with North Korea … as long as North Korea is abstaining from their very strong nuclear ambitions.”  Video Ad FeedbackKim Jong Un calls for 'exponential' increase in country's nuclear arsenal    02:14   - Source:CNN    China’s roleHan also discussed China’s role in the region, saying the superpower was “not the country it used to be,” in past decades that ushered in economic reforms and liberalization.  “China is a huge and important global player,” he said. “Including Korea, I think many countries would like to see (China) be more compliant with global rules.”  He added that though China “will contribute a lot in solving global problems,” the country often doesn’t meet the “expectations a lot of countries would like to have – for example, we hoped that China would be more aggressive and more active in reducing tensions in the Korean Peninsula.”  For years, China has been North Korea’s biggest trading partner and an economic lifeline, with Pyongyang isolated from much of the world.

(Photo by South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images)South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty ImagesWhy Asia's arms race risks spinning out of controlBut Beijing, too, is a major player in the Asia arms race.  In January, US and Japanese ministers warned of the “ongoing and accelerating expansion of (China’s) nuclear arsenal.” Just days later, Japan’s prime minister expressed concern over China’s military activities in the East China Sea, and the launch of ballistic missiles over Taiwan that landed in waters near Japan in August.  China’s military buildup, aggressive foreign policy and multiple disputed territorial claims haven’t gone unnoticed in Seoul – where attitudes toward Beijing are fast souring.  In the 2022 survey on South Korean nuclear armament, more than half of respondents said China would be the biggest threat to the country in 10 years, and many cited “threats other than North Korea” behind their support for a domestic nuclear arsenal.  Han acknowledged that Seoul was closely watching these territorial disputes.   “Peace in the Taiwan Strait is also very important for the security and peace of the Korean Peninsula,” he said. And though South Korea is “committed” to the one-China policy, he said, “at the same time, we (expect) China to be more rule-based, not behaving as a country … being condemned by international community.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

He was 61.   The actor was hospitalized after suffering a brain aneurysm in mid-February, Lago told CNN at the time.   Sizemore “passed away peacefully in his sleep” at Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, with his two sons and his brother, Paul Sizemore, by his side, Lago said in a statement released on behalf of the family.   “I am deeply saddened by the loss of my big brother Tom,” Paul Sizemore said in the statement. “He was larger than life. He has influenced my life more than anyone I know. He was talented, loving, giving and could keep you entertained endlessly with his wit and storytelling ability. I am devastated he is gone and will miss him always.”  On Monday, Sizemore’s family said doctors informed them there was “no further hope” and recommended “end of life decision” due to the condition of his health, according to a statement released. “We are asking for privacy for his family during this difficult time and they wish to thank everyone for the hundreds of messages of support, and prayers that have been received. This has been a difficult time for them.”   Tom Sizemore poses for a portrait at The Collective and Gibson Lounge Powered by CEG, during the Sundance Film Festival, on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP)Victoria Will/Invision/APTom Sizemore's family deciding end of life matters, rep saysBorn in Detroit, Sizemore made a name for himself in Hollywood playing tough guys.   He had an early, small role in the 1989 Oliver Stone film “Born on the Fourth of July” and scored his television break playing Sgt. Vinnie Ventresca in the ABC series “China Beach.”   Sizemore followed that with performances in various films, including “Point Break” in 1991, “True Romance” in 1993, “Natural Born Killers” in 1994 and “Strange Days” in 1995.   His costarring role as Bat Masterson in Kevin Costner’s western “Wyatt Earp” earned Sizemore acclaim. He went on to other major roles in “Pearl Harbor” and “Black Hawk Down,” both released in 2001.    He was perhaps best known for his role as Sgt. Mike Horvath in the 1998 World War II film “Saving Private Ryan.”   Sizemore recently appeared in the Netflix series “Cobra Kai” and the independent supernatural film, “Impuratus.”    Sizemore (front left) had a prominent role in the 1998 film 'Saving Private Ryan.'DreamWorks/Everett Collection    Off screen woes and recoverySizemore’s fame on screen was at times overshadowed by coverage of his life off screen.   Battling substance abuse for years, in 2003 he was convicted of domestic abuse against former girlfriend and Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. He had other legal run-ins and appeared on the VH1 series “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew” in 2010.   That same year he told CNN’s Larry King that he had been addicted to cocaine, heroin and meth.   Sizemore later talked about starring in the comedy series “Barbee Rehab” in a 2022 interview with Decider and was asked if he had some hesitancy in taking on the role.   “There was some, but it was so goofy and so not like rehab that I got over it,” Sizemore said, laughing at the time. “Plus, it wasn’t about drugs. It’s about obsessions and compulsions and… Barbees!”   In the same interview, Sizemore reflected on seeing magic in movies like “The Wizard of Oz” as a child and later as a teen watching “Taxi Driver.”    “I saw that movie every week for, like, two months when it was playing in the theater. I saw it eleven weeks in a row,” Sizemore said. “That’s when I first started thinking, ‘Whatever that is they’re doing up there, I want to be part of it. I want to do that.’”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Entertainment  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Meet the 4 men tapped to run China’s economy    			By Laura He, CNN		  Updated  1:49 PM EST, Sat March 4, 2023    Link Copied!   From left, Zhu Hexin, He Lifeng, Ding Xuexiang and Li Qiang.AP licensedHong KongCNN      The team of Communist Party officials running China’s economy is about to get a major makeover.  Party elites have just finalized nominations for key government positions ahead of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, which starts on Sunday.   They include the four men tapped to manage the world’s second biggest economy: Li Qiang as premier, Ding Xuexiang as executive vice premier, He Lifeng as vice premier and Zhu Hexin as the new central bank chief.  No women have occupied these key economic positions in Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s administration.  All four are expected to be formally endorsed at the congress. The appointments are seen as part of Xi’s attempt to strengthen the party’s control over the country’s economic institutions, where many Western-educated officials have long influenced policy making.  Chinese leaders and lawmakers attend the annual National People's Congress in Bejing in March 2021. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images/FileUnlike their predecessors, the four men, who are either close associates of Xi or connected to his trusted aides, haven’t been educated in the West or are perceived to have little experience dealing with international financial organizations.   Now all eyes are on how they will help shape policy as the Chinese economy navigates a growing array of challenges, including sluggish consumption, rising unemployment, a downturn in the housing market, lack of business confidence, local governments’ debt distress, an ageing population and increasing tension with the United States over technology sanctions.   The congress will set an economic growth target for this year that should be a considerable improvement on last year’s anemic 3%, one of the weakest performances in decades, but which is likely to be a far cry from the pace of expansion China enjoyed before the pandemic. The new team will have to deliver the recovery. Li QiangA former party boss of Shanghai who presided over the city’s chaotic two-month lockdown, Li Qiang was named the country’s No 2 party official after Xi during the leadership reshuffle in October.That puts the 63-year-old in line to succeed Premier Li Keqiang when he steps down during the upcoming congress.  Li Qiang was named the No 2 party official at the Communist Party's 20th congress in October  2022. Koki Kataoka/APIn China’s political system, the premier is traditionally responsible for managing the economy, with several vice premiers supporting his work and taking charge of different issues.   Born in the eastern province of Zhejiang, Li started his career as a worker at an irrigation pumping station. He received his undergraduate education in agricultural mechanization at a college in the city of Ningbo and then worked his way up through the provincial bureaucracy.   The Wujiang Bridge in the city of Zunyi in the southwest province of Guizhou on Nov. 24, 2021.Ou Dongqu/Xinhua/Getty Images/FILEChinese cities are struggling to pay their bills as 'hidden debts' soarHis career took off after he served as Xi’s de facto chief of staff when Xi was the party chief of Zhejiang province between 2002 and 2007.  Li would be the first premier since the Mao era not to have previously worked at the State Council, China’s cabinet, as vice premier, analysts say.   It was Li’s personal ties with Xi that appear to have clinched his promotion over more qualified candidates, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said when Li was promoted last year.   But some analysts said his tenure in Shanghai, particularly before last year’s Covid lockdown, pointed to a pragmatic, pro-business style.  During Li’s time there, Tesla built its first gigafactory outside the United States in the city. Tesla has sole ownership of that factory, the first foreign automaker in China to wholly own its plant.  “China’s business environment should turn more friendly, at least, in the coming two years” under Li, who is likely to support private companies and foreign investors, Citi analysts said in a research report.   In 2019, Li also oversaw the launch of China’s Nasdaq-style stock market on the Shanghai stock exchange. Ding XuexiangXi’s current chief of staff, Ding Xuexiang, may become the next executive vice premier, Nomura analysts said on Tuesday, citing their observations based on the ranking of the new Politburo Standing Committee.  Ding Xuexiang attends an event to introduce new members of the Politburo Standing Committee at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in October 2022. Ng Han Guan/APThat means the 60-year-old, who has never led a province or had much experience making economic policy, will likely carry overall responsibility for China’s domestic economy, particularly the country’s fiscal policy.    Born in the eastern province of Jiangsu, Ding studied metallurgy at the Northeastern Institute of Heavy Machinery. He began his career at the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials and spent 17 years there, rising from a researcher to deputy party chief.   He later joined the Communist Party’s committee in Shanghai and served as a top aide to Xi when he spent about seven months in the city as party chief in 2007. In 2013, Ding moved to Beijing as Xi’s personal secretary after Xi’s promotion to the country’s top job. He LifengMoreover, He Lifeng, who runs China’s powerful National Development and Reform Commission, may be appointed as the next vice premier in charge of economic, financial and industrial affairs, Nomura analysts said.   He Lifeng addresses a press conference in Beijing in March 2019. Stringer/ICHPL Imaginechina/AP/FileThe 68-year-old would succeed Vice Premier Liu He, who led China’s negotiations with the United States during trade talks in 2018 and 2019. Liu is a Harvard-trained economist who has been called  “a bridge between the East and West” by analysts.  He Lifeng, who received his undergraduate degree in finance from Xiamen University, has never studied overseas.  He is known for overseeing the construction of a massive state-led investment project billed as “China’s Manhattan” in Tianjin, when he served as the city’s senior official after the global financial crisis of 2008. The project has left a legacy of empty buildings, deserted skyscrapers and huge debt for the local government. Zhu HexinAnother key role to be confirmed during the congress is the governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), responsible for China’s monetary policy and overseeing the financial system.  Zhu Hexin speaks at the Sina China Banking Development Forum in Beijing in July 2015. Wei yao/ICHPL Imaginechina/APZhu Hexin, chairman of China’s state-owned financial conglomerate Citic Group, is the leading candidate to succeed US-educated economist Yi Gang as central bank governor, according to the Wall Street Journal.Zhu, 55, has spent most of his career working at the Bank of Communications in the wealthy eastern province of Jiangsu. He also had a stint in Sichuan province, in the southwest, as the deputy governor between 2016 and 2018.  After that, he worked at the PBOC as a deputy governor for two years, before being transferred to Citic Group in 2022.   Unlike Yi, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois, Zhu has little overseas experience.  Meanwhile, He Lifeng may serve a concurrent role as the party secretary of the PBOC, which could increase political backing for the bank, but also erode its authority, the WSJ reported, citing unnamed sources.  Currently, Guo Shuqing, who heads China’s banking and insurance regulator, serves a concurrent post as the party chief of the PBOC. Guo has also received some training in the West, attending Oxford University as a visiting scholar in the 1980s.  Xi’s selection of top roles represents a leadership style that “prioritizes personal loyalties over competence and productive discourse,” Sonja Opper, a professor at Bocconi University, previously told CNN in an interview.  “The risk is that China’s leadership becomes isolated and loses sight of alternative, possibly better ways to approach the many challenges the country faces,” she said.

Japanese islands, viewed from Mt. Shiude in Mitoyo, Kagawa prefecture.Kyodo News/Getty Images/FILECNN      Japan has recounted its islands – and discovered it has 7,000 more than it previously thought.  Digital mapping by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) recently found there to be 14,125 islands in Japanese territory, more than double the figure of 6,852 that has been in official use since a 1987 report by Japan’s Coast Guard.  However, the GSI this week stressed that the new figure reflected advances in surveying technology and the detail of the maps used for the count – it did not change the overall area of land in Japan’s possession.  It said that while there is no international agreement on how to count islands, it had used the same size criterion as the previous survey 35 years ago.  That entailed counting all naturally occurring land areas with a circumference of at least 100 meters (330 feet).   The new number does not include any artificially reclaimed land.   Japan's best islands to visit, from Okinawa to cat sanctuary AoshimaThe islands surrounding Japan have been at the heart of several territorial disputes.   Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a dispute that dates to the end of World War II, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.   Japan also says it has a historical claim to the uninhabited Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which it currently administers, but China has repeatedly challenged that claim.   Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea remain locked in a more than 70-year dispute over the sovereignty of a group of islets known as Dokdo by Seoul and Takeshima by Tokyo in the Sea of Japan, which Korea calls the East Sea.

Wuxi residents get tested for Covid in July, 2022. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images/FILEHong KongCNN      A Chinese city says it has destroyed a billion pieces of personal data collected during the pandemic, as local governments gradually dismantle their coronavirus surveillance and tracking systems after abandoning the country’s controversial zero-Covid policy.  Wuxi, a manufacturing hub on China’s eastern coast and home to 7.5 million people, held a ceremony Thursday to dispose of Covid-related personal data, the city’s public security bureau said in a statement on social media.  The one billion pieces of data were collected for purposes including Covid tests, contact tracing and the prevention of imported cases – and they were only the first batch of such data to be disposed, the statement said.  China collects vast amounts of data on its citizens – from gathering their DNA and other biological samples to tracking their movements on a sprawling network of surveillance cameras and monitoring their digital footprints.  But since the pandemic, state surveillance has pushed deeper into the private lives of Chinese citizens, resulting in unprecedented levels of data collection. Following the dismantling of zero-Covid restrictions, residents have grown concerned over the security of the huge amount of personal data stored by local governments, fearing potential data leaks or theft.   Last July, it was revealed that a massive online database apparently containing the personal information of up to one billion Chinese citizens was left unsecured and publicly accessible for more than a year – until an anonymous user in a hack forum offered to sell the data and brought it to wider attention.   In the statement, Wuxi officials said “third-party audit and notary officers” would be invited to take part in the deletion process, to ensure it cannot be restored. CNN cannot independently verify the destruction of the data.  Wuxi also scrapped more than 40 local apps used for “digital epidemic prevention,” according to the statement.  During the pandemic, Covid apps like these dictated social and economic life across China, controlling whether people could leave their homes, where they could travel, when businesses could open and where goods could be transported.  But following the country’s abrupt exit from zero-Covid in December, most of these apps faded from daily life.   On December 12, China scrapped a nationwide mobile tracking app that collected data on users’ travel movements. But many local pandemic apps run by the municipal or provincial governments, such as the ubiquitous Covid health code apps, have remained in place – although they are no longer in use.  Adobe StockNearly one billion people in China had their personal data leaked, and it's been online for more than a year Wuxi claims to be the first municipality in China to have destroyed Covid-related personal data from citizens. On Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform, users called for other local governments to follow suit.  Yan Chunshui, deputy head of Wuxi’s big data management bureau, said the disposal was meant to better protect citizens’ privacy, prevent data leaks and free up data storage space.  Kendra Schaefer, the head of tech policy research at the Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China, said the data collection related to local-level Covid apps was often messy, and those apps were difficult and expensive to manage for local governments.  “Considering the cost and difficulty managing such apps, coupled with concerns expressed by the public over data security and privacy – not to mention the political win local governments get by symbolically putting zero-Covid to bed – dismantling those systems is par for the course,” Schaefer said.  In many cases, she added, the big data departments at local governments were overwhelmed dealing with Covid data, so scaling back simply makes sense economically.   “Many cities have not yet deleted their Covid data – or have not done so publicly – not because I believe they intend to keep it, but because it simply hasn’t been that long since zero-Covid was halted,” Schaefer said.

President Joe Biden speaks as he meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Friday, March 3, 2023. Susan Walsh/APCNN      A year ago, when German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last visited Washington, Russian forces had yet to cross the border into Ukraine and skepticism abounded at the dire warnings from the White House that an invasion was imminent.  Scholz returned Friday for meetings with President Joe Biden after a transformative 12 months that required Europe to dramatically rethink its own security and Germany to undergo its most significant shift in military and energy policy in decades.  “There’s been a lot of change since the last time you were here,” Biden said at the start of the Oval Office talks, which were expected to last about an hour.  Scholz concurred: “A lot’s happened since last year, we’ve got a lot to talk about,” he said.   Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has turned Scholz, who took office two months before Russia’s invasion, into a crisis leader, overseeing Europe’s largest economy and most powerful democracy during the worst violence on the continent since World War II.  And it has thrust him and Biden into one of the world’s most consequential relationships, sustained by shared opposition to Russia’s invasion but strained at moments over how to respond.  “You stepped up to provide critical military support. And I would argue, beyond the military support, the moral support you’ve given Ukrainians has been profound. Profound,” Biden told his counterpart in the Oval Office.  “I know it’s not been easy,” Biden said. “Very difficult for you.”  White House officials say over the past year, Biden has developed a solid relationship with Scholz, who succeeded longtime chancellor Angela Merkel at the end of 2021. They spoke by phone three times in January alone, and during Friday’s session at the White House they were expected to speak extensively one-on-one in the Oval Office.  The overwhelming topic of discussion was Ukraine, according to senior administration officials, including discussions the two men have each held recently with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is pressuring the West for more powerful weapons as he prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  “The overarching purpose of this meeting was a chance for the two leaders to be able to coordinate specifically on Ukraine,” a senior administration official said ahead of the visit.  They were expected to also touch on recent intelligence suggesting China is considering providing Russia with lethal aid, a step US officials fear could prolong the conflict, though China wasn’t a “driving focus” of the talks.  The White House also announced another round of military assistance for Ukraine on Friday, including ammunition for weapons systems that the Ukrainians already have. The package totaled around $400 million.  In inviting Scholz to the White House again, Biden hoped to fortify a leader who has endured a trying first year in office.  A year ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Germany supplying Ukraine with weapons like Howitzers, Stinger missile launchers and Leopard tanks to stave off Russian invaders. A largely pacifist outlook had dominated Berlin’s foreign policy in the decades following German violence in World War II.  But now, Germany is investing again in its military and sending increasingly advanced weaponry, though not at the pace Zelensky would like. Other critics say Scholz has failed to occupy a unifying role in Europe akin to Merkel, preferring to operate unilaterally instead of in conjunction with fellow leaders like Emmanuel Macron of France. And some US officials say Germany remains overly cautious compared to other Western allies.  Still, the so-called “Zeitenwende,” or turning point, that Scholz called for in the days following Russia’s invasion has been welcomed at the White House and reinforced by many of the steps he’s taken in the months since.  Germany’s decision in January to provide Ukraine with Leopard tanks is the latest example of the country overcoming its post-war hesitancy for foreign military intervention. The decision only came after diplomatic wrangling with the United States, who agreed to provide Ukraine with its own Abrams tanks, despite warnings from the Pentagon they wouldn’t be as useful on the battlefield.  There remains some dispute over how, exactly, the deal came about. After Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last weekend, “the Germans told the president that they would not be prepared to send those Leopards into the fight … until the president also agreed to send Abrams,” the German government insisted the decision to send tanks was arrived at jointly and without any demands from Berlin.  Either way, the result has been viewed positively by Biden’s aides, some of whom took a skeptical view of Scholz a year ago when he appeared reluctant to apply sanctions on Russia should it invade Ukraine or cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Scholz took both of those steps once the invasion began, despite the risk of Germany being cut off from one of its main energy suppliers.   For his part, Scholz could use Friday’s meeting to raise with Biden his ongoing discussions with other European leaders about providing security guarantees for Ukraine as a way to begin the process of negotiating an end to the war.  Fear are growing among US and European officials that the grinding conflict could turn into a bloody stalemate, with each side making only small gains while still refusing to come to the negotiating table.  Speaking to the German parliament before leaving for Washington, Scholz said Thursday that Germany and its Western allies were in talks with Kyiv over future security guarantees in preparation of a sustainable peace for Ukraine.  “Such security guarantees, however, come with the presumption that Ukraine successfully defends itself in this war,” Scholz said, emphasizing that Germany would continue to support Ukraine with weapons supplies.  Scholz went on to say that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was not currently open to negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.   “Is Putin even ready … to negotiate a just peace? Nothing suggests it at the moment,” Scholz said.

About 35 million people across parts of the South and Southern Plains are at risk Thursday for severe thunderstorms – the worst of which could bring multiple rounds of ferocious winds, large hail and tornadoes, the Storm Prediction Center said.   A tornado destroying a home, a tornado above a man's home and a third tornado to the left in Bondurant, IA.Jon Bixler/Facebook4 tornado safety tips that could save your life“Thursday and Thursday night: An intensifying system is expected to produce significant severe storms and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding,” the National Weather Service warned. “Think now about what (to) do during a warning wherever you expect to be.”  The Storm Prediction Center on Thursday evening listed several tornado reports in Texas and one in Louisiana as of 7:40 p.m. CT.  In Shreveport, Louisiana, David Langston was inside a dry cleaning store when a tornado hit, he told CNN affiliate KSLA.   “The wind started picking up, and this lady said, ‘My babies are in the car,’” Langston told the station. “And she wanted me to help her, and I said, ‘Let’s go.’ But then all of a sudden, the wind got so bad that I said, ‘No ma’am, don’t go out.’ “  Her car was underneath a sign. If we had gone out there, I mean, we would have been hit by that sign.”  Langston said they rescued the two young children, unharmed, after the winds died down. “It just came up, and 20 seconds later it was gone,” he said. “And I mean, total chaos. Glass breaking out everywhere.”  A tornado watch issued Thursday evening for parts of southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana was set to run until midnight.   A Level 4 of 5 moderate threat of severe storms is in place for over 8 million people in eastern Texas, northern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. Those areas include Dallas; Fort Worth, Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana.  Storms coincided with power outages in Texas. More than 320,000 homes and businesses in Texas were without power as of 9:15 p.m. CT, according to utility tracker PowerOutage.us.  The Dallas-Fort Worth area Thursday afternoon also was put under a tornado watch that was scheduled to last until 10 p.m. CT. A line of severe storms moving through Texas brought several wind gusts in the 60 to 80 mph range across the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.  In the Dallas suburb of McKinney, people were injured when four tractor-trailers in the same stretch of highway were blown over. McKinney police didn’t specify how many people were hurt.   A strong storm seen at Dallas-Fort Worth airport on March 3, 2023.@jonaslen/InstagramBecause of thunderstorms, a ground stop was in effect Thursday night for the airports in Austin and San Antonio, meaning planes destined for Dallas are to be held at their airports of origin, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Earlier, there was a ground stop for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.   Memphis, Tennessee; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Waco, Texas, face a Level 3 of 5 severe storm risk. Cities with a Level 2 of 5 risk include Houston; Austin, Texas; and Jackson, Mississippi.  In Miller County, Arkansas, two people were unhurt despite being trapped in a house that collapsed during the storms, according to Michael Godfrey, the director of the county emergency management office.  Debris flies through the air near the Tarrant County Courthouse in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, on March 2, 2023. Tom Fox/APTorrential rainfall in the system is also a concern. Rain could fall as quickly as 2 inches per hour in the strongest storms, leading to flash flooding.   More than 24 million people are under flood watches from Oklahoma to Ohio. Up to 5 inches of rain is forecast across the region, and isolated totals could exceed 8 inches.  The severe weather threat will shift Friday to the Southeast and Ohio Valley on Friday, with Charlotte, Nashville, Atlanta and Louisville at risk.  And the same storm system is expected to bring heavy snow and ice to the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions by this weekend. Mammoth snowfall in the WestThis lengthy winter storm already has wreaked havoc in the West, with snow in New Mexico due to continue through Thursday afternoon. Up to 5 inches is possible in lower elevations, while 8 to 18 inches could fall across high elevations.

In Southern California, massive amounts of snow this week left some stranded and made roads impassable for days. Several areas across the state saw more than 100 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.   The California Department of Transportation said they have so far removed over 7 million cubic yards of snow – enough to fill 2232 Olympic size swimming pools.  Across the state, about 52,000 homes and businesses still had no power Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us.  Across California, several days of heavy snow knocked out power to thousands, made roads impassable and trapped residents in their homes.   The California National Guard will arrive in the San Bernardino mountains on Thursday to help dig out snowbound communities, according to the state Office of Emergency Services (CalOES). Nearly 100 inches of snow have fallen on the Lake Arrowhead and Crestline communities in recent days.   Aerial footage from CNN affiliate shows neighborhoods with indiscernible streets, homes with snow reaching second-story windows, and a local supermarket with its roof caved in due to the heavy snow.  Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a state of emergency for 13 counties, including San Bernardino County, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties.  Robert Hallmark, who says that this is the worst snowstorm of his 31 years living here, clears snow at his home as residents throughout the San Bernardino Mountains continue to be trapped in their homes by snow on March 1, 2023 in Running Springs, California.

More than a quarter of all that snowfall came down in two days this week.    Huntington Lake in the Sierra Mountains was lashed with 144 inches of snow over a six-day period this week, according to the Fresno County Office of Emergency Services. The office also reported 10 to 12 feet of snow near China Peak, which led to the closure of Highway 16.  While California gets a brief reprieve from the snow for the rest of this week, another system is expected to move into Northern California this weekend.

Companies listed in the S&P 500 index beat analysts’ earnings estimates by an average of just 1.3% last quarter. For context, that’s way down on the index’s 5-year average of 8.6%, according to FactSet data. What’s happening: There have been some steep and disappointing profit misses as corporate America feels the sting of sticky inflation and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.  Tech companies fared poorly this season: Apple    (AAPL) recorded a rare earnings miss while Intel    (INTC) and Google-parent company Alphabet also fell short of expectations.   But it wasn’t all doom-and-gloom. Energy companies brought in yet another quarter of record profits, with Big Oil companies — such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell — notching their most profitable years in history. Elsewhere, Tesla    (TSLA) reported record revenue gains and beat earnings expectations. Big box retailers Target    (TGT) and Walmart    (WMT) also surpassed estimates as US consumers kept on spending.   Here’s what else traders need to know about the final few months of last year and beyond.  Corporate profits could drop for the first time since 2020S&P 500 companies are on track to report a 4.6% drop in earnings year-over-year, according to FactSet data. That would mark their first earnings decline since the third quarter of 2020, when Covid shut down large swaths of the economy.   Gloomy forecasts aboundAbout 81 S&P 500 companies have issued negative earnings-per-share guidance for the first quarter of 2023, according to FactSet. That’s a lot higher than the 23 companies reporting positive guidance.    There was no shortage of foreboding forecasts from top execs on earnings calls this season.   Walmart beat estimates last quarter, but they also lowered expectations for future earnings.   Home Depot    (HD) CEO Ted Decker said he was concerned that consumers were becoming less resilient to the economy. “We noted some deceleration in certain products and categories, which was more pronounced in the fourth quarter,” he said on an analyst call.   Lowe’s executives, meanwhile, warned that they were preparing for a “more cautious consumer” this year.   Investors feel like celebratingWall Street traders appear to be taking this dour earnings season in their stride. The market is “rewarding positive earnings surprises more than average and punishing negative earnings surprises much less than average for the fourth quarter,” reports FactSet.    Inflation is (still) a big deal More than 325 S&P 500 companies have cited the term “inflation” during their earnings calls for the fourth quarter. That’s well above the 10-year average of 157, according to FactSet document searches.   But the worries over price hikes appear to be waning, at least a little bit. This marks the lowest number of S&P 500 companies using the “I”-word on their calls since the third quarter of 2021. Since last quarter, the number of inflation mentions has fallen by about 20%. The service economy, labor and China: What investors are watching▸ ISM Services PMI — a report that measures the strength of the US service sector — is due out at 10 a.m. ET. The data is expected to show a slight slowdown in growth between January and February (54.5 in February vs. 56.5 in January. For context, a reading above 50 means the services economy is expanding).   That deceleration would be a big deal. It would signal that the economy is beginning to cool and that the Fed’s efforts to fight inflation by raising interest rates are working. If services sector growth accelerates, however, it could signal that more aggressive rate hikes are ahead and send markets lower.  ▸ Wall Street is anticipating (or dreading, depending on who you ask) next Friday’s unemployment report. The February data is expected to shed some light on a shockingly resilient labor market.   Another unexpected surge in non-farm payrolls, like the 517,000 new jobs added in January, could indicate more Fed rate hikes are ahead. That could roil markets in this “good news is bad news” environment.   Analysts expect that the economy added 200,000 new jobs last month, according to Refinitiv data.   ▸ The Chinese economy surprised investors this week by quickly bouncing back from its zero-Covid shutdowns. China’s first consumer price index, producer price index and trade figures of 2023 are set to be released next week, which will show the full extent of the country’s rebound.   “These numbers will offer the first official indications of mainland China’s reopening effect following the rebound seen in PMI numbers,” wrote analysts at S&P Global.   Global manufacturing rose in February for the first time in seven months, according to the latest PMI surveys compiled by S&P Global. That growth was largely spurred on by China’s reopening. Another crypto mess Shares of Silvergate Capital, a large lender to cryptocurrency firms, plunged nearly 60% — a record drop —  on Thursday after the company told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it won’t be able to file its annual report on time and cited concerns about its ability to remain in business.   The majority of Silvergate’s crypto clients, including Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital and Crypto.com, quickly cut ties with the bank amid the chaos.   So what does it all mean?   My colleague Allison Morrow explains: The California-based lender reported a $1 billion loss for the fourth quarter as investors panicked over the collapse of FTX, the exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried that is now at the center of a massive federal fraud investigation.  FTX’s collapse in November rippled through the digital asset sector, forcing several firms to halt operations and even declare bankruptcy as liquidity dried up and investors fled.  But unlike FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager and other crypto companies that folded last year, Silvergate is a traditional, federally insured lender that has positioned itself as a gateway to the crypto sector.  It’s among the first major instances of crypto’s volatility spilling into the mainstream banking system — a scenario regulators and crypto skeptics have long feared.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a Quad ministers' panel at the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi on March 3, 2023. Olivier Douliery/APNew Delhi, IndiaCNN      Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and the support flooding in to Kyiv from countries across the world, sends a powerful message to “would be aggressors everywhere,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday during a panel discussion in New Delhi.  “Part of the reason countries way beyond Europe are also so focused on this and are working to support Ukraine and deal with the challenge is because they know it could have effect here,” Blinken said, speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitics conference.   “If we allow, with impunity, Russia to do what it’s doing in Ukraine, then that’s a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too,” he added.  The comments came as Blinken met with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia – a grouping known as the “Quad,” or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.The Quad is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s, though it has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China’s reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.  The foreign ministers of the United States, India, Japan and Australia meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit on March 3, 2023 in New Delhi.Secretary Antony BlinkenBlinken added that the challenges faced by people around the world cannot be dealt with by “any one country acting alone.”  “The great power of the Quad is you have four like-minded countries, united in their basic values, united in their basic interests, bringing different strengths, experiences, different comparative ways to tackle these problems,” he said.  Though he didn’t specify any “would-be aggressors,” he made several veiled references, saying the Quad is working on increasing countries’ maritime domain awareness – meaning greater surveillance on things happening in their waters – and tamping down on illegal fishing.  Top US officials have previously called out China for illegal fishing operations that “plunder the region’s provisions,” and accused Beijing’s “maritime militias” of intimidating and harassing Indo-Pacific countries.

But its threats are driving the group closer togetherChina has established the world’s largest naval force, built heavily-fortified islands in the South China Sea, and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels in the disputed waters – frequently stoking tensions with its neighbors, and prompting promises from the US to stand by its partners in the region.  The Quad ministers reiterated the point in a joint statement on Friday, expressing “serious concern at the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities.”  Though sometimes dubbed by critics as an “Asian NATO,” the Quad is not a formal military alliance – rather, it’s an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.  It does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.  Quad members cooperate across various fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.

Now what's Beijing going to do with it?But security and the goal of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” are key focuses – and the Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China’s influence, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing in recent years.  The strategic location of each of the Quad nations – at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them – has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China “clique” that is emblematic of a “poisonous” Cold War mentality.  The joint statement on Friday also touched on other regional and international issues, such as the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar following the military’s bloody coup two years ago, North Korea’s nuclear threat and increasingly aggressive missile testing, and the war in Ukraine.  The four ministers condemned the war “and the immense human suffering it is causing, and concurred that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,” according to the statement.

Former President Donald Trump arrives to deliver remarks at the South Carolina State House in Columbia on January 28, 2023. Win McNamee/Getty Images/FileCNN      Former President Donald Trump on Friday proposed building up to 10 futuristic “freedom cities” on federal land, part of a plan that the 2024 presidential contender said would “create a new American future” in a country that has “lost its boldness.”   Commuters, meanwhile, could get around in flying cars, Trump said – an echo of “The Jetsons,” the classic cartoon about a family in a high-tech future society. Work to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles is already underway by major airlines, auto manufacturers and other companies, though widely seen as years away from reaching the market.  “I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility,” Trump, who announced his third bid for the presidency in November, said in a four-minute video detailing his plan.   He said he would launch a contest to charter up to 10 “freedom cities” roughly the size of Washington, DC, on undeveloped federal land.   “We’ll actually build new cities in our country again,” Trump said in the video. “These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American dream.”Light on detailsTrump’s pitch comes the day before he is set to address the Conservative Political Action Conference in the Washington, DC, area, and as the 2024 Republican presidential field begins to take shape.   The proposal is the latest in a series of early policy offerings from Trump, who in recent weeks has also said he would seek to ramp up domestic energy production, adopt a more isolationist foreign policy stance and purge the government and military of “warmongers and globalists,” and undo a Biden executive order that would require government agencies to submit annual public plans aimed at promoting equity.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)Rebecca Blackwell/AP/FileTrump unveils plans to take on tech companies if he wins in 2024 in appeal to conservative baseIn December, the former president unveiled plans as part of his “free speech platform” that included vows to ban federal money from being used to label speech as misinformation or disinformation and to punish universities engaging in “censorship activities” with cuts to federal funding.   Trump did not elaborate Friday on how he would pay for his latest proposal – leaving unanswered what could be the biggest question as Republicans in Washington seek to curb federal spending. He also did not explain how some elements of his proposal differ from similar Democratic plans.  His plan, which was light on details, includes three additional planks: increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States; providing families with “baby bonuses” that he said would “help launch a new baby boom”; and launching a beautification effort aimed at removing “ugly” buildings and revitalizing parks and public spaces.   Trump did not explain what “baby bonuses” would amount to or who would qualify. It’s not clear how his proposal differs from the enhanced child tax credit, which wasn’t extended beyond 2021. A group of Democratic lawmakers and progressive advocates tried – but failed – to have it included in the $1.7 trillion spending measure in December. That proposal was blocked by Republicans. Trade battleTrump on Friday also called for universal tariffs and imposing higher taxes on imported goods. He said he would escalate a trade battle with China, which he began during his four years in the White House. Doing so, he said, would jump-start American manufacturing.   President Joe Biden has left tariffs in place on $350 billion of Chinese goods – nearly two-thirds of what the US imports from China – which were imposed by Trump.   However, the costs of those tariffs are being passed on to American consumers, and contributing to inflation, experts say.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last year that those tariffs on Chinese goods have “imposed more harm on consumers and businesses” than on China.   Getty Images, ReutersHere are the Trump properties at the center of the New York attorney general's lawsuit against the former President and his familyChris Rupkey, chief economist at markets research firm FwdBonds, said Trump’s proposed economic plan is reflective of the onetime real estate developer’s efforts before taking office.  “Builders build and make dreams a reality, but this plan looks like a stretch because the country cannot afford to undertake massive new projects when the national debt is over $31 trillion,” Rupkey said in an email. “There are some interesting ideas here, but this is not the right time for bold plans that dream big. There’s no money left in Uncle Sam’s till to pay for big dreams and daring projects.”  The nation is in the midst of a “cost-of-living crisis” that makes this too expensive of a proposition, Rupkey added.

This is his warning to the US    02:36Now playing   - Source:CNNSee More VideosLondonCNN      Russia could find itself with no money as soon as next year and needs foreign investment, outspoken Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska has said.   “There will be no money already next year, we need foreign investors,” he said at an economic conference in Siberia Thursday, according to comments reported by TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency.   The remarks from the billionaire — who called for an end to Moscow’s war in Ukraine in the early days of the conflict last year — contrast with a more upbeat assessment of Russia’s economic fortunes by President Vladimir Putin last week. Putin praised the resilience of the country’s economy in the face of unprecedented Western sanctions imposed in the past year.   Russia’s economic output shrank 2.1% last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the government. The contraction was more limited than many economists initially predicted.   A mysterious fleet is helping Russia ship oil around the world. And it's growingBut cracks are starting to show — Russia is cutting oil production this month — and Western sanctions could escalate further. Ultimately, Russia’s economic prospects are contingent on what happens in Ukraine.   Foreign investors, especially from “friendly” countries, also have a big role to play, Deripaska said. Whether they will come depends on whether Russia can create the right conditions and make its markets attractive, he was quoted as saying.  In a bid to starve Russia of funds for its aggression, Western countries have announced more than 11,300 sanctions since the February 2022 invasion, and frozen some $300 billion of Russia’s foreign reserves.  But China has thrown the Kremlin an economic lifeline by buying Russian energy, replacing Western suppliers of machinery and base metals among other products, and providing an alternative to the US dollar.     Still, Moscow has a steep hill to climb to replace revenues lost as a result of sanctions, not least from exports. Data released Friday showed that the European Union’s imports from Russia fell by 51% in value between February and December last year. The bloc was one of the main trading partners for Russia before the invasion of Ukraine, with 38% of Russia’s exports going to the European Union in 2020.  The Russian government’s revenue plunged 35% in January compared with a year ago, while expenditures jumped 59%, leading to a budget deficit of about 1,761 billion rubles ($23.3 billion).   Deripaska made his fortune in the aluminum business during the chaotic scramble for assets following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2018, he was sanctioned by the United States, which noted that the oligarch “does not separate himself from the Russian state.” Last year, he was indicted for allegedly violating US sanctions.  Forbes estimates Deripaska’s current net worth at just under $3 billion.  — Anna Chernova contributed reporting.

This is his warning to the US    02:36Now playing   - Source:CNNSee More VideosSeoul, South KoreaCNN      Concerns about North Korea’s chronic food shortages are growing, with multiple sources suggesting this week that deaths due to starvation are likely.  Some experts say the country has hit its worst point since a 1990s famine known as the “Arduous March” caused mass starvation and killed hundreds of thousands of people, or an estimated 3-5% of what was then a 20 million-strong population.  Trade data, satellite images and assessments by the United Nations and South Korean authorities all suggest the food supply has now “dipped below the amount needed to satisfy minimum human needs,” according to Lucas Rengifo-Keller, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  Even if food was distributed equally – something close to inconceivable in North Korea where the elite and military take priority – Rengifo-Keller said “you would have hunger-related deaths.”  South Korean officials agree with that assessment, with Seoul announcing recently that it believes deaths from starvation are occurring in some areas of the country. Though producing solid evidence to back up those claims is made difficult by the country’s isolation, few experts doubt its assessment.   Even before the Covid pandemic, nearly half of the North Korean population was undernourished, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.   Three years of closed borders and isolation can only have made matters worse.  In a sign of just how desperate the situation has become, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a four-day Workers’ Party meeting this week to discuss a revamp of the country’s agricultural sector, calling for a “fundamental transformation” in farming and state economic plans and a need to strengthen state control of farming.  North Korean trucks loaded with sacks of maize wait for clearance at the Chinese border in 1997, during the famine period known as the ""Arduous March.""Anu Nousiainen/AFP/Getty Images/FILEBut various experts say Pyongyang has only itself to blame for the problems. During the pandemic, Pyongyang ramped up its isolationist tendencies, erecting a second layer of fencing along 300 kilometers of its border with China and squeezing what little cross border trade it had access to.  And in the past year it has spent precious resources carrying out a record number of missile tests.  “There’s been shoot on sight orders (at the border) that were put in place in August 2020 … a blockade on travel and trade, which has included what very limited official trade (there was before),” said Lina Yoon, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.  During 2022, China officially exported nearly 56 million kilograms of wheat or maslin flour and 53,280 kg of cereals in grain/flakes form to North Korea, according to Chinese customs data.  But Pyongyang’s clampdown has strangled off unofficial trade, which as Yoon points out is “one of the main lifelines of the markets inside North Korea where ordinary North Koreans buy products.”   Cases in which people smuggle Chinese products into the country, with a bribe to a border guard to look the other way, have been next to non-existent since the borders closed.  Various experts say the root problem is years of economic mismanagement and that Kim’s efforts to ramp up state control further will only make things worse.  “The North Korean borders need to open and they need to restart trade and they need to bring these things in for agriculture to improve and they need food to feed the people. But right now they are prioritizing isolation, they are prioritizing repression,” Yoon said.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addresses the Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang, North Korea, on February 26, 2023.KCNA/ReutersBut as Rengifo-Keller pointed out, it is not in Kim’s interest to allow the unofficial trade of the past to re-emerge in this dynastically ruled country. “The regime does not want a flourishing entrepreneurial class that can threaten its power.”  Then there are the missile tests Kim remains obsessed with and his constant refusals of offers of aid from his neighbor.  South Korea’s Foreign Minister Park Jin told CNN in an interview last week that “the only way that North Korea can get out of this trouble is to come back to the dialogue table and accept our humanitarian offer to the North and make a better choice for the future.”   Prime Minister Han Duck-soo told CNN Thursday said the situation “is worsening, our intelligence shows, because it’s clear that their policies are changing… the chairman (Kim Jong Un) would like to put a lot of pressure to make it state dictated, you know, supply of food to their people, which will not function.”  Seoul’s Ministry of Unification was quick to point out Pyongyang continues to focus on its missile and nuclear program rather than feeding its own people.    A visitor looks over the border between South and North Korea from the Unification Observation Post in Paju, South Korea.Ahn Young-joon/APIn a briefing last month, vice spokesperson Lee Hyo-jung said, “according to local and international research institutions, if North Korea had used the expense of the missiles it launched last year on food supplies, it would have been enough to purchase over one million tons of food, believed to be more than enough to cover North Korea’s annual food shortage.”  Seoul’s rural development agency believes North Korea’s crop production last year was 4% lower than the year before, suffering flooding and adverse weather.   Rengifo-Keller fears the culmination of these effects coupled with the regime’s “misguided approach to economic policy” could have a disastrous impact on the already suffering population.   “This is a chronically malnourished population for decades, high rates of stunting and all signals point to a deteriorating situation, so it certainly wouldn’t take much to push the country into famine.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Players of Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers line up during a press conference on September 26, 2020, in Urumqi, China.VCG/Getty Images/FILECNN      The return of China’s top basketball league to its normal season format following years of Covid disruptions has been marred in controversy after an abrupt no-show from one of its former championship-winning teams amid accusations of mistreatment by its star player.  The squabble has sparked a headache for Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) boss – and former NBA star – Yao Ming and is the latest public spat to engulf a major league.  The Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers on Tuesday announced its withdrawal from the CBA after the league slapped it with a one-year suspension from acquiring and registering new players.   Guanghui, which is based in China’s western Xinjiang region, was slated to join other teams on Wednesday for the first matches after a mid-season break.  But in a tersely-worded a statement this week the team accused the league of being “full of chaos” and publicly rebuked Yao’s leadership.   At the heart of the fallout between Guanghui and the league is China national team star Zhou Qi, who is himself now publicly feuding with his own team.  Following an internal investigation, the CBA deemed Guanghui to have committed “registration violations” in the signing of Zhou in February.   This included transferring business operations without formal approval, and not being in accordance with the league’s hiring and salary regulations over the last three seasons.  Yao Ming, China's best known basketball star, at the Sydney Superdome on September 30, 2022Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images/FILEThe result of that investigation has since ignited a full-blown rift between Zhou and his team.  Most explosive are his accusations of bullying by team manager Guo Jian and club president Hou Wei, who according to Zhou went back on their word and hindered him from participating in NBA events in the US.   He provided photos and screenshots of documents supposedly backing up all of his claims.  “The two chairmans, Guo Jian and Hou Wei, and the management, have bullied me and lied to me for many years. I couldn’t bear it. I still couldn’t decide my own future as an adult in 2023,” Zhou wrote in a lengthy post on Chinese social media platform Weibo.  CNN has reached out to the team for comment.  Zhou has long been touted as Yao’s successor as a generational talent given his towering seven-foot-one (216 centimeters) height and previous experience playing with NBA team Houston Rockets — the same team that Yao was drafted to in 2002.  This would have been Zhou’s third stint with the Flying Tigers, having played between 2014-2017 and 2019-2021.  The saga has sparked heavy interest on China’s social media, where fans have flocked to discuss how Yao would react to the scandal and theories on who is ultimately to blame.  “There are no winners from this” and “the biggest victims are the fans” were among the most-liked comments. More angry users have rounded on Yao and described the furore as a “nuclear explosion in the basketball world”.  CNN has reached out to the CBA for comment.  Zhou Qi, seen here playing for China on July 20, 2022, in Jakarta, has been publicly feuding with his league team.Robertus Pudyanto/Getty Images/FILEBasketball commands a huge following in China primarily thanks to Yao’s Hall of Fame career in the NBA.  NBA viewership last year nearly returned to the levels seen before Chinese broadcasters’ 16-month blackout in 2019, according to Reuters. That is an estimated 500 to 800 million viewers through the season.  The CBA, though comparatively less popular, did see pre-Covid audience increases since Yao took charge in 2017.  In its statement Guanghui argues that the CBA “made serious mistakes in its unreasonable and absurd ‘punishment’”.  “After careful consideration, (Guanghui) has solemnly decided to: stop playing this season; and quit the CBA,” it said.  The team then took aim at Yao and the CBA of mismanagement, and Zhou for allegedly repeatedly discrediting the team.  “Since 2017, Yao Ming has held the position of both chairman of the Association and the League. The management of each are intertwined and confused, and the basketball industry is full of chaos,” Guanghui said.  Even after retirement Yao has remained one of China’s most recognisable international faces, acting as a prominent ambassador for sports and fronting a number of charitable causes including campaigns against the ivory trade and consuming shark fins.  Commenting on the Flying Tiger’s withdrawal, Yao told the state-run China National Radio on Wednesday that the Xinjiang club had made “huge contributions” to Chinese basketball in the past 20 years.  “We respect its decision and express regret,” Yao said. “Our top priority now is to bring the league and the games back to the fans.”  Zhou also responded to Guanhui’s broadside with in a lengthy statement of his own on Weibo, calling the revelations “fake news.”  “I admire the ‘creativity’ of (Guanghui) regarding the violations. Sadly, it has been unable to turn around on its road of deception. It’s gone further downhill”.   He concluded that the CBA’s penalty on Xinjiang “is fair and objective”.  Xinjiang, alongside then-All Star Zhou, won their first and only CBA Championship in 2017.  Guanghui’s withdrawal comes one week after soccer team Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard FC withdrew from China’s League One division after dissolving.   The next most popular sport after basketball, Chinese soccer is reeling from its own post-Covid financial difficulties as well as a crackdown on corruption at the highest administrative levels.  A total of six clubs from its marquee Chinese Super League withdrew – and folded – during the pandemic, with dozens more across all divisions.   Many of those who remain are struggling to pay the salaries of players and staff – some even filing appeals to world governing body FIFA.  Meanwhile, a former national team head coach, former national team director, and former Chinese Football Association secretary-general are under investigation by China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection for suspected “serious violations of party discipline and the law”.

US adds Chinese genetics firms to trade blacklist over surveillance allegations    			By Philip Wang and Kathleen Magramo, CNN		  Published  11:06 PM EST, Thu March 2, 2023    Link Copied!   The US Department of Commerce oversees export controls.Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images/FileAtlanta/Hong KongCNN      The United States on Thursday added two subsidiaries of Chinese genetics company BGI to a trade blacklist over allegations it conducted genetic analysis and surveillance activities for Beijing, which Washington says was used to repress ethnic minorities in China.  The US Department of Commerce, which oversees export controls, said in a statement that BGI Research and BGI Tech Solutions (Hongkong) “present a significant risk of diversion to China’s military programs.”  FILE - Residents watch a convoy of security personnel armed with batons and shields patrol through central Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region, Nov. 5, 2017. China's discriminatory detention of Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the western region of Xinjiang may constitute crimes against humanity, the U.N. human rights office said in a long-awaited report Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022, which cited ""serious"" rights violations and patterns of torture in recent years. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)Ng Han Guan/APUN report on China's Uyghurs: What you need to know“The addition of these entities is based upon information that indicates their collection and analysis of genetic data poses a significant risk of contributing to monitoring and surveillance by the government of China, which has been utilized in the repression of ethnic minorities in China,” the statement said.  CNN has reached out to BGI Group, which is one of the world’s largest genomics companies and a listed firm based in Shenzhen, for comment on its subsidiaries.  In 2020, the US Department of Commerce added two other BGI affiliates, Xinjiang Silk Road BGI and Beijing Liuhe BGI, to the trade blacklist over their alleged involvement in human right abuses against Uyghur and other mainly Muslim minorities in China’s far western region of Xinjiang.   BGI Group issued a statement at the time denying the allegations, saying it “does not engage in unethical practices and does not provide gene technology for the surveillance of Uighurs.”  Rights groups have documented human rights abuses in Xinjiang since the 2000s, including forced labor and coercive enforcement of family planning and birth control policies on Uyghur minorities, according to a damning United Nations report last year. China has regularly pushed back against these reports with firm denials.  The latest list compiled by the US Department of Commerce includes a total of 28 Chinese entities, four from Pakistan, three from Myanmar and one each from Belarus, Russia and Taiwan.  Being placed on the list means the entities are restricted from buying American technology and other goods.

A resident in the San Bernardino Mountains clears snow at his home on Wednesday, March 1, 2023, in Running Springs, California.David McNew/Getty ImagesCNN      Some California residents remain trapped inside their homes after a winter storm dumped feet of snow across the Golden State, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to issue a state of emergency in 13 counties, including hard-hit San Bernardino County.   Authorities there had conducted almost 100 rescues by Wednesday evening, San Bernardino County Fire Chief Dan Munsey said in a news conference, though authorities have not learned of any serious injuries or deaths.   “We’re responding to medical calls. We’re responding to fires in these trapped vehicles. We are going to people’s houses where they’ve had trees through their houses or some sort of roof collapse and we are evacuating them to our evacuation shelters,” Munsey said.   Just over 70,000 homes and businesses remained without power early Thursday, days after the first round of winter storms hit California, according to PowerOutage.us. And while the state is getting a brief reprieve from the snow through the end of the week, another system is expected to move into Northern California this weekend.

Hong/APNewsom declared a state of emergency for San Bernardino County and 12 others – among them Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties – late Wednesday, with his office saying in a statement that a significant number of state personnel had responded to support San Bernardino County.   By Thursday morning, the Office of Emergency Services had deployed the California National Guard to help dig out snowbound communities in the mountains, with a spokesperson saying they had departed Fresno and were expected to arrive by midday.   It could take a week to 10 days to dig out the mountain communities hampered by the heavy snow, officials warned in a news conference Wednesday. Mountain residents were still unable to access roads Wednesday, per fire department spokesperson Eric Sherwin. The county has about 500 miles of tight, winding roads throughout the mountain areas that need to be plowed, county Public Works Director Brendon Biggs said.   LOS ANGELES, CALIF. - FEB. 28, 2023.

Residents in a three-story apartment building in Olympic Valley had to be evacuated after it was struck by an avalanche Tuesday evening, engulfing the bottom two stories, the sheriff’s office said on Facebook. The building’s occupants were uninjured.   Huntington Lake in the Sierra Nevada saw 144 inches of snow, per a report from the Fresno County Office of Emergency Services, which reported 10 to 12 feet of snow near China Peak, leading to the closure of Highway 168.   In Southern California, 106 inches of snow were recorded since February 22 at Mount Baldy, outside of Los Angeles. Of that 106 inches, 29 fell in the past two days, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward, while the other 77 inches fell late last week and through the weekend.

Sign up here.Hong KongCNN      The US Department of Energy’s assessment that Covid-19 most likely emerged due to a laboratory accident in China has reignited fierce debate and attention on the question of how the pandemic began.  But the “low confidence” determination, made in a newly updated classified report, has raised more questions than answers, as the department has publicly provided no new evidence to back the claim. It’s also generated fierce pushback from China.  “We urge the US to respect science and facts, stop politicizing this issue, stop its intelligence-led, politics-driven origins-tracing,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.  The Department of Energy assessment is part of a broader US effort in which intelligence agencies were asked by President Joe Biden in 2021 to examine the origins of the coronavirus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.   That overall assessment from the intelligence community was inconclusive, and then, as now, there has yet to be a decisive link established between the virus and a specific animal or other route – as China continues to stonewall international investigations into the origins of the virus.  Four agencies and the National Intelligence Council assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans through natural exposure, while one assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory-related accident. Three other intelligence community elements were unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, according to a declassified version of the 2021 report.  The majority of agencies remain undecided or lean toward the virus having a natural origin – a hypothesis also widely favored by scientists with expertize in the field. But the change from the US Department of Energy has now deepened the split in the intelligence community, especially as the director of the FBI this week commented publicly for the first time on his agency’s similar determination made with “medium confidence.”  Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means the information obtained is not reliable enough, or is too fragmented to make a more definitive judgment.  And while the assessment and new commentary has pulled the theory back into the spotlight, neither agency has released evidence or information backing their determinations. That raises crucial questions about their basis – and shines the spotlight back on gaping, outstanding unknowns and need for further research.

Many have also questioned the lack of data released to substantiate the latest claim.  Virologist Thea Fischer, who in 2021 traveled to Wuhan as part of a World Health Organization (WHO) origins probe and remains a part of ongoing WHO tracing efforts, said it was “very important” that any new assessments related to the origin of the virus are documented by evidence.   “(These are) strong accusations against a public research laboratory in China and can’t stand alone without substantial evidence,” said Fischer, a professor at the University of Copenhagen.  “Hopefully they will share with the WHO soon so the evidence can be known and assessed by international health experts just as all other evidence concerning the pandemic origin.”  A senior US intelligence official told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the new Department of Energy assessment, that the update to the assessment was conducted in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and in consultation with experts outside government.

It was further enhanced amid a failure to find a “smoking gun” showing which animal could have passed the virus to people at Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market – the location linked to a number of early known cases – amid limitations to follow-up research.  Some experts who have been closely involved in examining existing information, however, are skeptical of the new assessment giving the theory more weight.  “Given that so much of the data we have points to a spillover event occurring at the Huanan market in late 2019 I doubt there’s anything very significant in it or new information that would change our current understanding,” said David Robertson, a professor in the University of Glasgow’s School of Infection and Immunity, who was involved in recent research with findings that supported the natural origin theory.  He noted that locations of early human cases centered on the market, positive environmental samples, and confirmation that live animals susceptible to the virus were for sale there are among evidence supporting the natural origins theory – while there’s no data supporting a lab leak.  “The extent of this evidence continually gets lost (in media discussion) … when in fact we know a lot about what happened, and arguably more than other outbreaks,” he said.

Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images/FILE    China’s responseEfforts to understand how the pandemic started have been further complicated by China’s lack of transparency – especially as the origin question spiraled into another point of bitter contention within rising US-China tensions of recent years.   Beijing has blocked robust, long-term international field investigations and refused to allow a laboratory audit, which could bring clarity, and been reticent to share details and data around domestic research to uncover the cause. However, it repeatedly maintains that it has been transparent and cooperative with the WHO.  Chinese officials carefully controlled the single WHO-backed investigation it did allow on the ground in 2021, citing disease control measures to restrict visiting experts to their hotel rooms for half their trip and to prevent them from sharing meals with their Chinese counterparts – cutting off an opportunity for more informal information sharing.  Citing data protection, Beijing has also declined to allow its own investigatory measures, like testing stored blood samples from Wuhan or combing through hospital data for potential “patient zeros,” to be verified by researchers outside the country.  China has fiercely denied that the virus emerged from a lab accident, and has repeatedly tried to assert it could have arrived in the country for the initial outbreak from elsewhere – including a US laboratory, without offering any evidence supporting the claim.

Kiichiro Sato/AP/FileBlinken's new warning to Beijing is the latest sign of deteriorating US-China relationsBut a top WHO official as recently as last month publicly called for “more cooperation and collaboration with our colleagues in China to advance studies that need to take place in China”– including studies of markets and farms that could have been involved.   “These studies need to be conducted in China and we need cooperation from our colleagues there to advance our understandings,” WHO technical lead for Covid-19 Maria Van Kerkhove said at a media briefing.   When asked about the Department of Energy assessment by CNN, a WHO representative said the organization and its origins tracing advisory body “will keep examining all available scientific evidence that would help us advance the knowledge on the origin of SARS CoV 2 and we call on China and the scientific community to undertake necessary studies in that direction.”  “Until we have more evidence all hypotheses are still on the table,” the representative said.

It’s like, let me tell you what I saw or what I heard, or what people are saying to me.”  “It’s in that context because I’m out every day. I’m in the classroom. I’m out, you know, somewhere in the United States,” she added. “I think it’s a good balance really.”  And on the other side of the relationship, Biden said her husband helps her understand there are different ways of looking at issues and viewpoints.  “Well, sometimes I don’t, I may not see things from his perspective. Let’s just put it that way. And so he offers both sides,” she said. “I’m always better like, ‘This person feels this way.’ ‘Yes, but this is why they,’ – you know, he’s very good at that – understanding why people feel the way they do. He understands both sides, which is part of his strength.”  Her comments came during a wide-ranging interview with CNN on her five-day visit to Africa, which included stops in Namibia and Kenya.  CNNvideo    Hear what first lady thinks about Biden's reelection plansBiden, who has been married to the president for nearly 46 years, has long said she’s not an adviser to her husband, but she is his most trusted partner and wields a significant amount of influence within the White House. The first lady told CNN she is “all for” her husband running for reelection in 2024 but also left an opening should he decide not to run, noting, “If he wants to do something else, we’re there too.”  Biden plays a unique role as first lady, the first to hold a full-time paid job outside of the White House. She teaches English and writing full time at Northern Virginia Community College, a job she also held for her eight years as second lady when her husband was vice president.  From her perch at the White House, she has spent time advocating for education issues, helping military families through her “Joining Forces” initiative and working to end cancer through the “Cancer Moonshot.” The first lady is one of the Biden administration’s most often used surrogates at events across the country.  “I think it’s all so interesting and really fulfilling for me as, as a teacher, and as a woman, you know, to see the empowerment of other young women in them getting education,” she said when asked how she balance the two roles. “There’s nothing I can ever give up.”  “I really feel like I’ve grown so much in this role, because of the opportunities that I’ve been given whether it’s traveling to Africa, or whether it’s traveling to Nebraska,” she added. “I see so many different communities and reach out to people in all walks of life.”  Biden said her experiences as an educator and first lady have helped her build connections with people during her travels abroad, which has included trips to 10 countries in her first two years in the role.  “Joe tends towards policy,” she said. “I try to, you know, go in a little bit maybe a softer direction.”  The first lady traveled to Africa to emphasize the United States’ commitment to the region at a time when Russia and China have made inroads on the continent.  “We want to say, ‘Hey, we’re back. We’re back. And we’re here to meet you halfway,’” she said.  It marked her sixth trip to Africa after having traveled to the continent five times as second lady. She focused on delivering messages about women’s empowerment, youth engagement, and the need to preserve democracy as well as highlighted programs funded through PEPFAR, the Bush-era initiative aimed at fighting HIV/AIDS around the world.  The first lady also looked to shine a spotlight on the severe drought affecting East Africa, traveling to the rural village Lositeti in Kenya on her final day in the country.  “Livestock is dying. There’s no water. There’s no grass. There are no crops. Mothers can’t lactate. They’re not able to feed their children. It’s a major problem,” she said. “I’m here before it gets any worse to try to create awareness and say, ‘How can we find solutions for these major problems?’”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

He is the author of “The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.” The views expressed in this commentary are the author’s own. View more opinion on CNN.CNN      The Chinese lab leak report from the Department of Energy saying it has “low confidence” that the Covid-19 virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan made headlines earlier this week.  Peter BergenCNNThen on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray weighed in, telling Fox News that “the FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.”  On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning responded to that assessment, saying that the lab leak theory holds “no credibility at all.”  This all adds to the confusion surrounding the virus’s origins. There is considerable science pointing to animal-to-human transmission as the origin of the virus, but there is also credible reporting and the FBI director’s public assessment that it likely leaked from labs researching viruses in Wuhan.  And we may never truly know how the Covid-19 virus originated because the Chinese government didn’t allow international inspectors into Wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in December 2019.  Initially, the local Wuhan government downplayed the virus. That doesn’t necessarily mean they were covering up a lab leak, but rather this may point to simple incompetence – a pretty good explanation of most human activity.  As CNN noted, “top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis” may have been to blame, a conclusion based on an examination of internal Chinese documents from the first months of the crisis.  By the time the central Chinese government got serious about the virus, it was already spreading worldwide.  Security personnel keep watch outside Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organization (WHO) team tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Wuhan, Hubei province, China February 3, 2021.Thomas Peter/Reuters/FileCovid 'lab leak theory': What we've learnedWhile the new Department of Energy intelligence report does not settle the question of the precise origin of the virus, it does point us to the need for a bipartisan Covid-19 commission that goes well beyond US House investigations of Covid that are planned for this year.  Consider that almost as many Americans have died of Covid-19 already – some 1.1 million – as have died in every war since the American Revolution. If that isn’t a significant national security problem, I’m not sure what is.  And yet the United States hasn’t had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened. A good deal of that is likely because the whole issue of the pandemic is so politicized – but so too were the debates about whether the George W. Bush administration might have done a better job thwarting the 9/11 attacks.  The Bush administration initially blocked a commission to investigate 9/11. Following intense public pressure, the administration finally agreed to allow a commission to be formed more than a year after the attacks.  The 9/11 commission not only told the whole backstory of the attacks, but it also proposed lasting reforms that made Americans safer when they were implemented, such as the creation of a National Counterterrorism Center that coordinates all counterterrorism intelligence across the US government and the creation of a new Office of the Director of National Intelligence which coordinates the work of all of the US intelligence agencies.  A similar Covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn’t work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic.  Each party should appoint subject matter experts on pandemics, epidemiology and emergency response to take part in this Covid-19 commission.  It should have sufficient staff and money and subpoena power to investigate questions such as, “How did we get here?” And, “What can be done to mitigate the next pandemic?”    This general view shows the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province on February 3, 2021, as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus, visit. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAssessment Covid-19 leaked from Chinese lab is a minority view within US intel community, sources sayOf course, some questions may never be completely settled, like the lab leak theory vs. the natural transmission theory.  Still, there are pressing questions that the Covid-19 commission should address so that we are better prepared for the next pandemic, which will inevitably eventually happen.  Here are eleven questions that a Covid-19 commission could try and answer:  Where did the coronavirus originate from?After 9/11, the US spent many billions of dollars preparing for a possible bioterrorism attack. Where did all that funding go and why were those defenses against bioterrorism not more helpful in responding to the pandemic?Why did the Trump administration eliminate the National Security Council’s pandemic unit in 2018? What effect did that have? An early decision by former President Donald Trump during the pandemic was to bar non-US citizens who had recently visited China from entering the US. What kind of effect did that have on mitigating the spread of the virus? Why didn’t the US government ensure there were enough medical-grade masks to cope with the pandemic when it started?Why was there so little federal leadership on containing the virus in the early months of the pandemic? Those decisions were primarily left to individual states. What effect did this uncoordinated response have?Trump said on February 26, 2020, that the number of Covid-19 cases would soon be close to zero. He also claimed that the coronavirus was no more dangerous than the flu. What effect did this have on the behavior of the American public and how did that behavior impact the spread of the virus?What role did right-wing media play in downplaying the pandemic and how did that affect sentiments among some Republicans that the coronavirus was being hyped?Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump’s coronavirus response coordinator, told a congressional committee in closed-door testimony in 2021 that “we probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range.”  How did she come to that conclusion?To its credit, the Trump administration launched “Operation Warp Speed,” which saved many lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. As part of that effort, the US invested $2.5 billion in Moderna, which produced a testable vaccine on humans in only two months. Why did Operation Warp Speed work so well? And what are the lessons for future vaccine development? Covid-19 mortality rates per capita in the US are much higher than in other wealthy nations such as Canada, France, Germany and Japan.

The North Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 18, 2022.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      The White House on Thursday released an ambitious national cybersecurity strategy that calls for new federal regulation of vulnerable critical infrastructure firms and for software makers to be held liable when their products leave gaping holes for hackers to exploit.  The strategy – shaped by major hacking incidents that threatened key public services in the first year of the Biden administration – embraces the US government’s regulatory and purchasing power to force companies that are critical to economic and national security to raise their cyber defenses.  It reflects a widely held belief in the US government that market forces have failed to keep the nation safe from cybercriminals and an array of foreign governments such as Russia and China.   “We have to drive the entire ecosystem to be more cyber vigilant,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with CNN on Thursday.  The Biden administration will look for new regulatory authorities if necessary “to make sure that we are shoring up our critical infrastructure” in the face of advanced hacking threats “because the adversaries are not decreasing in activity, only increasing.”  Acting National Cyber Director Kemba Walden said that too often small businesses and local governments bear the brunt of cyberattacks.  “This isn’t just unfair, it’s ineffective,” said Walden, a White House official, told reporters on Wednesday.  The strategy is a policy document and not law, but it could shape corporate behavior for years to come as firms compete for billions of dollars in federal contracts that increasingly require a minimum set of cybersecurity defenses. And the White House says it wants to work with Congress to develop legislation that holds software makers liable when their products and services don’t provide adequate protections from sabotage.   The goal of US government and corporate work on cybersecurity should be to “correct market failures, minimize the harms from cyber incidents to society’s most vulnerable,” a copy of the strategy states.   The strategy does not specify which sectors of the economy the administration could regulate next, but US officials have previously signaled that one area of focus could be health care. Ransomware attacks – hacks that lock up computer systems and demand a fee – have put an even greater stress on hospitals across the country struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.   So far, the Biden administration has imposed cybersecurity requirements on sectors such as aviation and oil and gas pipelines. The genesis for those regulations in many ways was a May 2021 ransomware attack by an alleged Russian-speaking hacker that shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipelines in the US for days.  Corporations have sometimes balked at the regulations.  After oil and gas industry groups complained that cybersecurity regulations from the Transportation Security Administration were too onerous and unrealistic, the Biden administration last year revised the regulations to give pipeline operators more time to report cyber incidents to the government.  Multiple administrations, including the Trump and Obama administrations, have tried to shore up federal defenses against hacking threats and in some cases drive big changes that make agencies safer in the long term.   There has been some progress. Agencies now have more visibility into malicious cyber activity than ever before, officials say.   But in other cases, bureaucratic inertia has gotten in the way. The Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, says it has made over 700 public recommendations for federal agencies to improve their cyber defenses since 2010. About a fifth of the recommendations had not been implemented as of December, according to GAO.  In the last month, the US Marshals Service was hit by a ransomware attack that affected sensitive law enforcement information, and the FBI has had to deal with a cyber incident involving a computer network used in investigations of child sexual exploitation.  In the interview Thursday, Mayorkas said it was incumbent on the federal government to share what it learns from hacking incidents so the private sector can protect itself.  “The lessons learned should spread throughout the entire cyber ecosystem and not be limited to the particular domain in which it occurs,” Mayorkas told CNN.  Geopolitics has also been a roadblock to improved cybersecurity. The US has for years tried to blunt the impacts of hacking operations from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, to limited effect. And US officials have accused all of those governments of harboring, or even enlisting, cybercriminals that attack US organizations – accusations those governments deny.  After the big pipeline hack in 2021, President Joe Biden made a big push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on cybercriminals operating from Russia. But any chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago.   A senior administration official acknowledged the obstacle when rolling out the new cybersecurity strategy.   “We do have a problem where Russia is serving as a de facto safe haven for cybercrime,” the official told reporters.  In the last few years, including during the Trump administration, US officials have rallied support from allies in Europe and elsewhere to condemn alleged hacking operations from Russia and China, and to arrest cybercriminals who travel to Europe.  “[T]he criminal justice isn’t going to be able to on its own address this problem,” the senior official added, “so we do need to look at other elements of national power to be going after the threat.”  The official cited US Treasury Department sanctions on hackers and the State Department’s multi-million-dollar offers for information on criminal gangs and intelligence operatives. US military and intelligence services also conduct their own hacking operations to collect intelligence or to try to deter foreign governments in cyberspace.  “We want to shrink the surface of the earth that people can conduct malicious cyber activity with impunity,” the senior official said, “and put pressure on them and make their lives a little bit less pleasurable.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

So this is not moving output to anywhere, from anywhere. This is supplemental production.”  The company currently has capacity to build about 2 million cars a year at four factories, in Fremont, California; Shanghai, China; Austin, Texas; and Berlin, Germany. It has set a goal of eventually building 20 million cars a year. The company delivered just over 1.3 million cars in 2022. The largest automaker in the world by production volume, Toyota, delivered just over 10 million cars globally in 2022.  Tesla did not comment on the cost of the new plant. The news was a confirmation of plans announced Tuesday by Mexican President  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for Tesla to build its next factory in the country. Reuters reported that Mexican officials said the plant could cost $1 billion.  The company estimates to build the additional plants needed to reach 20 million vehicles will cost a total of $150 billion to $175 billion, including the $28 billion in investment that it has already made in its history.  “Maybe this total investment looks large,” said CFO Zachary Kirkhorn. “I think its quite small relative to our ambitions.”  The company also announced that earlier Wednesday it built 4 million vehicles in its history.  Shares of Tesla    (TSLA) slipped more than 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday, although that was up a bit from a larger decline before Musk’s announcement more than three hours into the presentation. There had been hope by some investors that Tesla    (TSLA) would announce details about a next generation of vehicles. Musk declined to answer a question about the next generation vehicle.  “We will have a proper sort of product event,” Musk said. “We’d be jumping the gun if we were to answer that question.”  In response to another question from an analyst, Musk said he doesn’t anticipate Tesla ever having more than 10 different vehicles in its product lineup. He derided the broad offerings of competing automakers as simply a “shuffling” of many similar models.  The Inflation Reduction Act passed last year restored tax credits of up to $7,500 to buyers of the less expensive Tesla cars, the Model 3 and Model Y, as long as their list price is under $55,000. To qualify for the tax credit, the cars must be assembled in North America, so the eventual output from the plant in Mexico should qualify.  Most of the global automakers already have assembly plants in Mexico. According to Reuters, there are 20 auto assembly plants in the country. General Motors has three, Ford has two, including one that make its Mustang Mach-E, the EV SUV that is a competitor to Tesla. Stellantis — which builds cars under the Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep brands — has three.  In addition Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Audi, Mazda, Mercedes, Kia and BMW all have plants in Mexico.  According to statistics from the US Trade Administration, a part of the Commerce Department, Mexican plants were producing just under 4 million cars a year in the years before the pandemic reduced the supply of auto parts, particularly computer chips, and auto production worldwide. They produced about 3.5 million cars last year. That makes it the seventh largest country in terms of auto production.  But 90% of the cars it builds are exported, with 76% destined for the United States.

One of China’s richest women takes over for her father at real estate developer Country Garden    			By Laura He, CNN		  Updated  5:35 AM EST, Thu March 2, 2023    Link Copied!

Yang Huiyan succeeded her father Yang Guoqiang as chairman of the company that he founded, according to a Wednesday filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which said the appointment took effect the same day.    Yang, 68, also known as Yeung Kwok Keung in Cantonese, had tendered his resignation from the position of chairman “due to age,” the statement said.

In little more than a decade, he grew the firm into one of the largest real estate developers in the country.  The company boasted a record-setting $1.7 billion IPO in Hong Kong in 2007. Last year, Country Garden was China’s No 1 developer by sales, which reached $67 billion.   The younger Yang has served as a co-chairman of the company since 2018 and jointly managed the day-to-day operations with her father.

Fang Xing/Imaginechina/AP/FILEYang, 41, had a net worth of $9.2 billion as of Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That placed her as China’s second richest woman, behind only Wu Yajun, the 59-year-old founder of Longfor Properties, who has a fortune of $9.7 billion.   Yang Huiyan’s wealth comes mainly from her majority stake in Country Garden, which was largely transferred to her by her father in 2005, two years before the company’s IPO.  Yang’s father resigned at a time when China’s property market is mired in a historic downturn.  The real estate sector has been lurching from one crisis to another since 2020, when Beijing started cracking down on excessive borrowing by developers to rein in their high debt. A debt crisis hit the industry after Evergrande, the second largest property developer in China, suffered a severe cash crunch and defaulted on its debt in late 2021.  Since then, a number of cash-strapped developers have sought protection from creditors.   Country Garden’s stock price has lost more than half of its value in the past year.

Sentiment cooled even further last year after thousands of home buyers refused to continue paying mortgages on unfinished properties.  The crash in the real estate market has dealt a blow to the finances of local governments, which rely heavily on land sales revenue.   Authorities have shifted policy to rescue the industry, including easing restrictions on borrowing for developers and rolling out loans. But the recovery seems to be slow.   Yang Guoqiang’s resignation is the latest in a string of departures by prominent property entrepreneurs.

Her focus is on arms control, nuclear weapons policy issues and Russia-NATO relations. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. CNN      Easy to miss in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s speech to parliament last week was a glancing reference to the possibility of Russia resuming nuclear testing.   Marion Messmer Marion MessmerIn a surprise move, Putin said that Russia was ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the US conducted one first.  While most of the media focus has been on Russia suspending its participation in the New START nuclear arms treaty, this announcement was just as significant, with potentially devastating consequences.   It would signify a further step towards escalation in Ukraine by demonstrating Russia’s intent to use nuclear weapons and could begin another, more devastating, nuclear arms race.  Neither Russia nor the US have conducted a nuclear weapons test since the early 1990s – soon after that, they negotiated the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in Geneva – and although both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998, only North Korea has continued to test nuclear warheads since.   If Russia were to resume tests, other nuclear armed states might follow. North Korea would certainly take this as carte blanche for further tests and there would be concern in the US about potentially falling behind Russia in the development of new nuclear capabilities. All potentially leading to a new arms racing dynamic.

But by inserting this into his ‘State of the Nation’ speech, Putin appears to be creating a false narrative that the US is working towards a nuclear weapons test to justify Russia breaking the CTBT and once again conducting its own tests.   Indeed, the Russian news agency TASS reported in early February, days before Putin’s speech, that the Novaya Zemlya nuclear test site is ready to resume if needed. Why might Russia want to begin testing again? Firstly, as a signal of intent to ride roughshod over all nuclear agreements, demonstrating its capability and resolve – domestically and internationally – to use nuclear weapons.   And secondly, because Russia is developing new nuclear capabilities and has insufficient data without new warhead tests.   Neither reason is comforting. A Russian nuclear weapons test would shatter several decades of international agreements and any sense of certainty in non-proliferation efforts. The CTBT underpins the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by creating a credible premise that states will reduce their nuclear arsenals over time rather than continuing to expand.What would Russian nuclear weapons tests mean for other nuclear armed states?It would foment concerns in other nuclear-armed states that Russia can gain valuable insights from test data which they are currently missing out on.   This could lead to more states testing as they modernize their arsenals. In the US, some political figures would be likely to call for nuclear weapons tests, not wanting to be outdone by Russia or fall behind. A new nuclear arms race would emerge with several nuclear powers competing, amid few remaining treaty constraints.   Workers unload civilian bodies in a cemetery in Bucha, Ukraine on April 7, 2022.Rodrigo Abd/APOpinion: In Ukraine, a river of horrors has swelled to a flood By abandoning the CTBT and expanding its nuclear arsenals, Russia and any other states joining in a new series of tests would seriously damage the NPT. It is hard to see how it could recover from such a drastic departure of its central promise – that the five Nuclear-Weapon States will reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons – resulting in complete and irreversible disarmament.    It would also increase the potential of other states pursuing nuclear weapons again. South Korea has already hinted several times this year at investing in a nuclear program if the threat from North Korea does not diminish. A return to a global nuclear arms race may push them over the edge.  Nuclear testing could also be read as a signal of further escalation, demonstrating Russia’s resolve to use nuclear weapons in war or an escalation of the conflict between Russia and NATO. It would mean a step change from Putin’s rhetorical threats, to a dangerous reality which could easily spin out of control.What could be done if Russia was seen preparing for a test? A Russian nuclear weapons test would not come out of the blue. Intelligence services would be able to see preparations ahead of time. The US and the UK have been sharing regular defense intelligence updates since before the invasion of Ukraine, to signal to Russia that its motives are transparent and to help allies coordinate. They could use this same mechanism to draw attention to an upcoming test and to try to prevent it.  In such an event, the international community should work together to impress upon Russia its seriousness and coherence against a nuclear weapons test.A Russian nuclear weapons test would not come out of the blue. Intelligence services would be able to see preparations ahead of time. Marion Messmer  The response should be to immediately increase sanctions until Russia reverses any test preparations. The European Union should act more quickly on sanctions than it has previously. Knowing the risks, other states who so far have avoided taking a position might switch and join the transatlantic pressure on Russia.  China and India have a key role to play. So far, they have taken an ambivalent stance on Ukraine, abstaining on UN votes and refusing to condemn Russia outwardly. However, they have criticized its nuclear threats.   China has shown that it is not comfortable with such nuclear brinksmanship and equally does not want to see Russia or the US investing in expansion and development of their arsenals. Seeing such test preparations could see China threaten to withdraw its political and economic support for Russia, which would be a heavy blow to Putin’s military ambitions.What could be done if Russia conducted a test?By conducting a nuclear weapons test, Putin may well want to frighten Western states into no longer supporting Ukraine. However, it is far more likely that NATO member-states, worried about escalation, would simply double down on their support.   There are no good options in this scenario: a conventional response from NATO might also be an escalation. A change in nuclear alert levels would send a strong signal to Russia but could also provoke further escalation.   A new nuclear arms race would look different from that of the Cold War. It would no longer be largely a race between Russia and the US and would certainly include China – and have other regional nuclear dynamics implications.   In case of a Russian nuclear test, all other nuclear-armed states (with the exception of North Korea which would be unlikely to join) would need to stand together against nuclear testing and work to bring Russia back into compliance.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook History has several examples where the world came close to a devastating nuclear war and was saved by good fortune.

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko meets with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing.Pavel Orlovsky/Belta/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko – a close ally of Vladimir Putin – vowed to deepen defense and security ties and expressed shared views on the war in Ukraine during a Wednesday meeting in Beijing, as geopolitical tensions around Russia’s war continue to rise.  Lukashenko endorsed China’s recent position on a “political solution” to the conflict, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout of the meeting, referring to a statement released by Beijing last week which called for peace talks to end the conflict, but did not push for a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine – drawing skepticism from Western leaders.  Both Xi and Lukashenko expressed “deep concern over the prolonged armed conflict” and looked forward to an “early return to peace in Ukraine,” according to a joint statement following their sit down in the Great Hall of the People, where Xi greeted Lukashenko in a ceremony alongside a phalanx of Chinese troops.  The visit from the Belarusian leader – who allowed Russian troops to use Belarus to stage their initial incursion into Ukraine last year – comes as tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent weeks, including over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.   Beijing has denied those claims and instead sought to portray itself as an impartial agent of peace – in contrast to the United States, who it has accused of “adding fuel to the fire” in the conflict and damaging the global economy with sanctions targeting Russia.  Speaking about the war in Wednesday’s meeting, Xi called for “relevant countries” to “stop politicizing and instrumentalizing the world economy” and act in a way to help “resolve the crisis peacefully,” in an apparent reference to the US and its allies.   The joint statement underscored the alignment between Minsk and Beijing when it comes to their opposition of what they see as a Western-led global order, with their joint statement including opposition to “all forms of hegemonism and power politics, including the imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions and restrictive measures against other countries.”   China and Belarus, which was also targeted in hefty Western sanctions following Russia’s invasion, would also bolster their cooperation across a range of economic areas, the statement said.   They also pledged to “deepen cooperation” on military personnel training, fighting terrorism, and “jointly preventing ‘color revolution’” – a reference to popular pro-democracy movements autocrats allege are backed by Western governments.

Kiichiro Sato/AP/FileBlinken's new warning to Beijing is the latest sign of deteriorating US-China relations    Tensions with the WestThe meeting, which Chinese state media described as “warm and friendly,” was the leaders’ first face-to-face since upgrading ties to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit last September in Uzbekistan, which Putin also attended.  “Today we will jointly set out new visions for the development of the bilateral ties … Our long-lasting friendly exchanges will keep our friendship unbreakable,” Xi told Lukashenko during the meeting, according to Chinese state media. He also endorsed Belarus in becoming a full member of the China and Russia-led SCO, where it is currently an observer state.  Speaking the same day from Uzbekistan, which is also a SCO member, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China “can’t have it both ways,” by “putting itself out as a force for peace in public,” while it continues to “fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.”  Blinken said that there are “some positive elements” of China’s peace proposal but accused China of doing the opposite of supporting peace in Ukraine “in terms of its efforts to advance Russian propaganda and misinformation about the war blocking and tackling for Russia.”   He also repeated Western concerns that China is considering providing Russia with lethal aid and later said he had no plans to meet with Russian or Chinese counterparts at a G20 meeting for foreign ministers scheduled to take place in New Delhi in India on March 2.  Lukashenko said he fully supports Beijing's ""recent"" security initiative days after it released a 12-point position on Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Belarusian PresidencyThe tightening of ties between Minsk and Beijing also comes alongside a years-long decline in Belarus’ relations with the West.  The former Soviet state was targeted by sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies in response to Moscow’s aggression after Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border north of Kyiv.  The European Union also does not recognize the results of Lukashenko’s 2020 election win – which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the country and were followed by a brutal government crackdown. The US has also called the election “fraudulent.”  There have been fears throughout the conflict in Ukraine that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another Russian offensive, or that Lukashenko’s own troops would join the war. Before visiting Moscow earlier this month, Lukashenko claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked.  Like China, Belarus has previously implied that the US does not want to see an end to the conflict.   In comments to reporters earlier this month before heading to Moscow to meet with Putin, Lukashenko maintained he wanted to see “peaceful negotiations” and accused the United States of preventing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from negotiating.  “The US are the only ones who need this slaughter, only they want it,” he said.

A US Air Force F-16 fighter jet flies during a public display at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix, Arizona on March 17, 2018. Yichuan Cao/NurPhoto/Getty Images/FILECNN      The Biden administration has approved an estimated $619 million potential arms sale to Taiwan, including hundreds of missiles for F-16 fighter jets, in a move that will likely further inflame already heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing.  The administration formally notified Congress on Wednesday of the proposed sales of F-16 munitions and related equipment.  A State Department official said the potential sale is “consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and our longstanding One-China policy,” wherein “the United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.”  The official noted Taiwan will use its own funds for the purchase.   “The United States’ support to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defense capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,” the official said.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement that “the Air Force has full combat capabilities in the two types of missiles that the United States agreed to sell this time,” adding: “Besides allowing us to effectively defend our airspace against provocations from the communist military, it also helps us stock weapons and boost our defensive resilience.”  “The provision of defensive weapons to our country is the basis for preserving regional peace, and the Ministry of National Defense expresses our sincere gratitude to the United States,” the statement continued.  The single-engine F-16 fighters would be at the heart of Taiwan’s defense in the event of any air attack from China.  The Chinese Communist Party claims Taiwan, a democratically ruled island of 24 million people, as part of its sovereign territory despite never having controlled it.  Beijing sends military aircraft and ships into the Taiwan Strait on a daily basis as it keeps up military pressure on the island.  On Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the US should cease arms sales to and military contacts with Taiwan.  “The US arms sales seriously undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests, Sino-US relations, and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” spokesperson Mao Ning said in a regular press briefing.  Taiwan’s air force has been upgrading older F-16A/B fighter jets, originally acquired in the 1990s, to the F-16V, or Viper, jets, equipping them with advanced radar systems and new mission computers, the official Central News Agency (CNA) reported in 2021. It planned to upgrade 141 fighters to the newer version by this year, the 2021 report said.  Taiwan has also purchased 66 new F-16Vs from manufacturer Lockheed Martin in the United States, and delivery of those was expected to start this year, CNA reported in 2021.  A news release from the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency on Wednesday said the defense contractors for the munitions and equipment will be Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.  According to the release, the munitions include: 100 AGM-88B High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles; 23 HARM training missiles; 200 AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles; 4 AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM Guidance Sections; and 26 LAU-129 multi-purpose launchers.  “This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability. The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the release stated.

Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday for the first time since the war in Ukraine began more than a year ago.  The brief contact on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in New Delhi marks a significant moment as high-level engagements between the United States and Russia have become exceedingly rare since the start of the war last February.   Blinken and Lavrov’s meeting comes amid some of the most heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow in decades.  Their conversation took place not only against the backdrop of the ongoing war – and stern warnings to the Chinese about materially supporting Russia’s conflict – but also amid deteriorating bilateral relations. Moscow has suspended its participation in the New START Treaty, the only remaining nuclear arms control agreement between Russia and the US, and it continues to hold American Paul Whelan in what the State Department has deemed as wrongful detention.  Blinken raised those three key issues – the war, New START, and Whelan – in his roughly 10-minute-long engagement with Lavrov, according to a State Department official traveling with the top US diplomat. Blinken was the one to initiate the conversation, the official and Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova both said.  However, the official noted that there aren’t high expectations the meeting will lead to a breakthrough on key issues of tension between the countries.  “I wouldn’t say that coming out of this encounter there was any expectation that things will change in the near term,” the State Department official told the traveling press.‘End this war of aggression’Blinken said he called on Russia to “end this war of aggression” and “engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace.”  “President Zelensky has put forward a 10 point plan for a just and durable peace. The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis,” Blinken said at a press conference later Thursday in Delhi.  “President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there’s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts and I quote ‘the new territorial realities,’ while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.”  The top US diplomat said the message calling on Moscow to cease its war echoed “what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations and what so many G 20 Foreign Ministers said today.”  At the newsconference, Blinken indicated that many of those foreign ministers had also on Thursday raised directly to China their concerns that Beijing will provide lethal assistance to Russia.  Blinken noted that “this is a shared concern” and reiterated that “this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China.”  “And I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions. So I’m not going to detail what they would be. But of course, we have sanctions authorities of various kinds. That would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at,” he said.‘Serious proposal’ to release Paul WhelanBlinken said that in his conversation with Lavrov, he “raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan as I have on many previous occasions.”  “The United States has put forward a serious proposal. Moscow should accept it,” he said.   Whelan, a former US Marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.  In December 2022, the US secured the freedom of another wrongfully detained American, Brittney Griner, in a prisoner swap, but US officials said that Moscow refused to accept the deal to release Whelan as well.   Whelan FamilyUS had 'direct conversations' with Russia on Paul Whelan since Griner's release, State Department saysElizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan’s sister, told CNN following Blinken’s exchange with Lavrov that “of course, we are pleased to see Paul’s case elevated in this manner, and take a great deal of comfort in the fact that the Secretary of State continues to press for a solution to Paul’s wrongful detention.”  David Whelan that the mention of his brother “at such a rare engagement between the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister” was appreciated.   “It reinforces our sense that the White House continues to advocate for Paul, even if we do not always see the activity,” he told CNN.‘Urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision’ on New STARTThe top US diplomat also “urged  Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision and return to implementing the New START treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation.”  Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would stop participating in the key arms control agreement, and signed a law formally suspending participation it in on Tuesday.  “Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries. It’s also what people around the world expect from us as a nuclear powers,” Blinken said.   “I told the foreign minister that, no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and Soviet Union did even at the height of the Cold War,” he added.  The brief sidelines engagement between Blinken and Lavrov was their first face-to-face encounter in more than a year. They last met in person in Geneva last January – just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.   Blinken and Lavrov were both present at several meetings together over the past year, but had not spoken with each other on those occasions.  And as recently as Wednesday, Blinken suggested he would not meet with his Russian counterpart at the meeting in the Indian capital.  “No plans to see either at the G20, although I suspect that we’ll certainly be in group sessions of one kind or another together,” Blinken said at a press conference Wednesday, referencing both Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang.  The two spoke by phone last July for the first time since the start of the war. In that “frank and direct conversation,” Blinken said he “pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.”    CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indonesia's President Joko Widodo at last year's G20 Leaders Summit in Indonesia. Willy Kurniawan/ReutersNew DelhiCNN      Foreign ministers from the world’s biggest economies convened in New Delhi Thursday in what was seen as a grand test for Indian diplomacy, which ultimately didn’t succeed in reaching a consensus because of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.   In the second high-level ministerial meeting under India’s Group of 20 (G20) presidency this year, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, met his American, Chinese and Russian counterparts, hoping to find enough common ground to deliver a joint statement at the end of the summit.   But amid festering divisions over Moscow’s war, New Delhi was unable to convince the leaders to put their differences aside, with Jaishankar admitting the conflict had struggled to unite the group.   India, the world’s largest democracy with a population of more than 1.3 billion, has been keen to position itself as a leader of emerging and developing nations – often referred to as the Global South – at a time when soaring food and energy prices as a result of the war are hammering consumers already grappling with rising costs and inflation.   Those sentiments were front and center during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opening remarks earlier Thursday, when he spoke of multiples crises the world faces, with less wealthy nations hit especially hard.   “The experience of the last few years, the financial crisis, climate change, the pandemic, terrorism and wars clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said.   “We must also admit that the tragic consequences of this failure are being faced most over by the developing countries,” who he says are most affected by global warming “caused by richer countries”.   Eluding to the war in Ukraine, Modi acknowledged the conflict was causing “deep global divisions.” But he encouraged the foreign ministers to put differences aside during their meeting Thursday.   “We should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can,” he said.

Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the summit, according to a State Department official traveling with Blinken.  Blinken and Lavrov spoke for roughly 10 minutes, the same official said.  Russian Ministry of Foreign affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but played down its significance.  “Blinken asked for contact with Lavrov. On the go, as part of the second session of the twenty, Sergey Viktorovich (Lavrov) talked. There were no negotiations, meetings, etc,” she said.  Deep disagreements over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine played out in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru last month as well, when G20 finance chiefs failed to agree on a statement after their meeting.   Both Russia and China declined to sign the joint statement, which criticized Moscow’s invasion. That left India to issue a “chair’s summary and outcome document” in which it summed up the two days of talks and acknowledged disagreements.  Analysts say that throughout the war New Delhi has deftly balanced its ties to Russia and the West, with Modi emerging as a leader who has been courted by all sides.   But as the war enters its second year, and tensions continue to rise, pressure could mount on countries, including India, to take a firmer stand against Russia – putting Modi’s statecraft to the test. India’s balancing actArguably India’s most celebrated event of the year, the G20 summit has been heavily promoted domestically, with sprawling billboards featuring Modi’s face plastered across the country. Roads have been cleaned and buildings freshly painted ahead of the dignitaries’ visit.   Taking place in the “mother of democracies” under Modi’s leadership, his political allies have been keen to push his international credentials, portraying him as a key player in the global order.  Last year’s G20 leaders’ summit in Bali, Indonesia, issued a joint declaration that echoed what Modi had told Russian President Vladimir Putin weeks earlier on the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan.  “Today’s era must not be of war,” it said, prompting media and officials in India to claim India had played a vital role in bridging differences between an isolated Russia and the United States and its allies.

Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesIndia, analysts say, prides itself on its ability to balance relations. The country, like China, has refused to condemn Moscow’s brutal assault on Ukraine in various United Nations resolutions. Rather than cutting economic ties with the Kremlin, India has undermined Western sanctions by increasing its purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer.  But unlike China, India has grown closer to the West – particularly the US – despite ties with Russia.  New Delhi’s ties with Moscow date back to the Cold War, and the country remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for military equipment – a vital link given India’s ongoing tensions with China at its shared Himalayan border.  The US and India have taken steps in recent months to strengthen their defense partnership, as the two sides attempt to counter the rise of an increasingly assertive China.

So when and if Putin wishes to come to the table to negotiate, he will have no shortage of diplomats hoping to help,” he said.  Still, as Putin’s aggression continues to throw the global economy into chaos, India has signaled an intention to raise the many concerns faced by the global South, including climate challenges and food and energy security, according to Modi’s opening speech earlier Thursday.   “The world looks upon the G20 to ease the challenges of growth, development, economic resilience, disaster resilience, financial stability, transnational crime, corruption, terrorism, and food and energy security,” Modi said.Navigating tensionsWhile Modi’s government appears keen to prioritize domestic challenges, experts say these issues could be sidelined by the tensions between the US, Russia and China, which have increased recently over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.  Speaking to reporters last week, Ramin Toloui, the US assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, said while Secretary of State Antony Blinken would highlight its efforts to address food and energy security issues, he would also “underscore the damage that Russia’s war of aggression has caused.”  Blinken will “encourage all G20 partners to redouble their calls for a just, peaceful, and lasting end to the Kremlin’s war consistent with UN Charter principles,” Toloui said.   At the same time, Russia in a statement Wednesday accused the US and the European Union of “terrorism,” stating it was “set to clearly state Russia’s assessments” of the current food and energy crisis.   “We will draw attention to the destructive barriers that the West is multiplying exponentially to block the export of goods that are of critical importance to the global economy, including energy sources and agricultural products,” Russia said, hinting at the difficulties New Delhi might face during the meeting.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP)Sean Kilpatrick/APG20's criticism of Russia shows the rise of a new Asian power. And it isn't ChinaIndia has “worked very hard not to be boxed into one side or the other,” Markey said. The country could not “afford to alienate Russia or the US and Modi doesn’t want discussion of the war to force any difficult decisions or to distract from other issues, like green, sustainable economic development,” he added.   But with plummeting ties between Washington and Beijing after the US military shot down what it says was a Chinese spy balloon that flew over American territory, New Delhi will have to carefully drive difficult negotiations between conflicting viewpoints.   China maintains the balloon, which US forces downed in February, was a civilian research aircraft accidentally blown off course, and the fallout led Blinken to postpone a planned visit to Beijing.  As differences played out during the ministerial meeting Thursday, analysts say while India will be disappointed at the outcome, they were in a very difficult position to begin with.   “It will be a disappointment for Modi, but not one that cannot be managed,” Markey said. “Nor would it be India’s fault, as it would primarily be a reflection of the underlying differences over which Modi has very little control.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Ohio toxic trainResidents of East Palestine, Ohio, will get the opportunity today to address the operator of a train that derailed while carrying toxic chemicals in their community nearly one month ago. The EPA has ordered Norfolk Southern to meet with residents to answer questions about long-term health effects following the wreck. Last month, Norfolk Southern – which was also ordered to fully clean up the site – backed out of a town hall with local officials, citing threats against its employees. In addition to mounting frustrations among residents, workers’ unions are saying some crews involved in the cleanup have also reported symptoms. However, the EPA and local government officials have repeatedly said their tests show the air quality in the area is safe and the chemicals should dissipate.2. InsulinEli Lilly, one of the biggest players in the US insulin market, announced a series of price cuts on Wednesday that would cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 for many people with diabetes. “Insulin costs less than $10 to make, but Americans are sometimes forced to pay over $300 for it. It’s flat wrong,” President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday, calling the announcement “a big deal.” Although insulin is relatively inexpensive to make, the cost has been a problem for many Americans for years. At least 16.5% of people in the US who use insulin report rationing it due to the cost. At the same time, demand for insulin has grown significantly as diabetes has become the fastest-growing chronic disease in the world, a 2022 study found.

Gas pricesThe average cost of a gallon of gas in the US stands at $3.37, according to AAA, down from $3.50 a month ago. That decline led many companies to end fuel surcharges, a move that has been met with mixed reactions. Fuel surcharges that were added in response to skyrocketing energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine went directly to ride-share drivers and were meant to help soften the blow of high gas prices. Beginning last March, Uber riders were paying an extra $0.45 or $0.55 in fees per trip and an additional $0.35 or $0.45 for Uber Eats food delivery, depending on the location. Lyft riders were paying a $0.55 surcharge per ride. Amazon also tacked on a $5 fuel and inflation surcharge on some merchants. The removal of surcharges means consumers have fewer fees – but it also means drivers will have less of a cushion to pay for gas.4. SpaceXSpaceX and NASA launched a fresh crew of astronauts on a mission to the International Space Station early this morning. The mission kicks off a roughly six-month stay in space where the crew will carry out science experiments and maintain the two-decade-old station. The launch marked the second attempt to get this mission, called Crew-6, off the ground. The first launch attempt was called off on Monday due to what officials said was a clogged filter. The vehicle is carrying two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and an astronaut from the United Arab Emirates. It’s expected to spend about one day maneuvering through space before linking up with the space station.  Video Ad FeedbackSpaceX night launch produces stunning display    03:16   - Source:CNN    5. TaiwanThe Biden administration has approved an estimated $619 million potential arms sale to Taiwan, including hundreds of missiles for F-16 fighter jets, in a move that will likely further inflame already heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing. The administration formally notified Congress on Wednesday of the proposed sale of F-16 munitions and related equipment. A State Department official said the potential sale is “consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and our longstanding One-China policy,” wherein “the United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.” In response, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement today urging the US to cease military contacts with Taiwan and end the arms sales.

Japanese flags on a street in Ginza, Tokyo on December 29, 2022.Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      The number of births registered in Japan plummeted to another record low last year – the latest worrying statistic in a decades-long decline that the country’s authorities have failed to reverse despite their extensive efforts.  The country saw 799,728 births in 2022, the lowest number on record and the first ever dip below 800,000, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Health on Tuesday. That number has nearly halved in the past 40 years; by contrast, Japan recorded more than 1.5 million births in 1982.  Japan also reported a record high for post-war deaths last year, at more than 1.58 million.  Deaths have outpaced births in Japan for more than a decade, posing a growing problem for leaders of the world’s third-largest economy. They now face a ballooning elderly population, along with a shrinking workforce to fund pensions and health care as demand from the aging population surges.  Japan’s population has been in steady decline since its economic boom of the 1980s and stood at 125.5 million in 2021, according to the most recent government figures.  Its fertility rate of 1.3 is far below the rate of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population, in the absence of immigration.  The country also has one of the highest life expectancies in the world; in 2020, nearly one in 1,500 people in Japan were age 100 or older, according to government data.  These concerning trends prompted a warning in January from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida that Japan is “on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.”  “In thinking of the sustainability and inclusiveness of our nation’s economy and society, we place child-rearing support as our most important policy,” he said, adding that Japan “simply cannot wait any longer” in solving the problem of its low birth rate.  Japanese flags adorn a popular street in the shopping district of Ginza in Tokyo on December 29, 2022.Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesIt's 'now or never' to reverse Japan's population crisis, prime minister says A new government agency will be set up in April to focus on the issue, with Kishida saying in January that he wants the government to double its spending on child-related programs.  But money alone might not be able to solve the multi-pronged problem, with various social factors contributing to the low birth rate.  Japan’s high cost of living, limited space and lack of child care support in cities make it difficult to raise children, meaning fewer couples are having kids. Urban couples are also often far from extended family in other regions, who could help provide support.  In 2022, Japan was ranked one of the world’s most expensive places to raise a child, according to research from financial institution Jefferies. And yet, the country’s economy has stalled since the early 1990s, meaning frustratingly low wages and little upward mobility.  The average real annual household income declined from 6.59 million yen ($50,600) in 1995 to 5.64 million yen ($43,300) in 2020, according to 2021 data from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.  Attitudes toward marriage and starting families have also shifted in recent years, with more couples putting off both during the pandemic – and young people feeling increasingly pessimistic about the future.  It’s a familiar story throughout East Asia, where South Korea’s fertility rate – already the world’s lowest – dropped yet again last year in the latest setback to the country’s efforts to boost its declining population.  Meanwhile, China is inching closer to officially losing its title as the world’s most populous country to India after its population shrank in 2022 for the first time since the 1960s.

In his first public comments on the FBI’s investigation into the virus’ origins during an interview with Fox News, Wray said that “the FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.”  FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks during a press conference on January 26, 2023.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images/FILECNN reported in 2021, citing two sources familiar with the matter, that the FBI had “moderate confidence” in the lab-leak theory.   Wray’s comments come just days after news of the Department of Energy’s “low-confidence” assessment that Covid-19 most likely originated from a laboratory leak in China, underscoring a divide in the US government as the majority of the intelligence community still believes that Covid either emerged naturally in the wild, or that there is still too little evidence to make a judgment one way or another.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a 2021 report that revealed the National Intelligence Council, along with four other unidentified agencies, assessed with low confidence that the initial Covid-19 infection “was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus.”  Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.  Wray said in the interview that the FBI has a team of experts who focus specifically on the risk of biological threats that come into the “wrong hands,” including by a “hostile nation state.”  “You’re talking about a potential leak from a Chinese government-controlled lab that killed millions of Americans,” Wray said of the coronavirus, “and that’s precisely what that capability was designed for.”  Wray said that most details of the FBI’s investigation remain classified, and that it has been difficult to work with the Chinese government on investigating the pandemic’s origin.  “I will just make the observation that the Chinese government, it seems to me, has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate the work here,” the bureau director said. “The work that our US government and close foreign partners are doing. And that’s unfortunate for everybody.”  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs pushed against the Department of Energy’s updated assessment during a briefing on Monday, with spokesperson Mao Ning saying that “the parties concerned should stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin.”    CNN’s Jeremy Herb, Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen and Pamela Brown RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Human rights advocate Tong Yi, testifies during a hearing of a special House committee dedicated to countering China, on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2023, in Washington.Alex Brandon/APCNN      Bipartisan lawmakers warned of the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party on Tuesday during the first hearing of the House select committee on China, a rare demonstration of unity across the aisle in a Congress increasingly divided along partisan lines.  The panel’s chairman, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, described the stakes in sweeping and dire terms at the outset of the hearing, saying, “This is an existential struggle over what life will look like in the 21st century – and the most fundamental freedoms are at stake.”   Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel’s top Democrat, argued that working across the aisle is critical for the US to counter the threat. “We must practice bipartisanship,” he said. “We must recognize that the CCP wants us to be fractious, partisan and prejudiced,” a reference to the Chinese Communist Party.   Gallagher made a clear distinction between the Chinese government and its citizenry, saying, “We must constantly distinguish between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people themselves, who have always been the party’s primary victims.”  And Krishnamoorthi stressed the need to “avoid anti-Chinese or Asian stereotyping at all costs.”  The hearing featured several high-profile witnesses, including former President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and China expert and former deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger.   McMaster said the committee “can help determine the combinations of policies and legislation necessary to counter CCP aggression and rebuild America’s and the free world’s competitive advantages.”   The hearing also featured compelling first-person testimony from Tong Yi, former secretary to one of China’s leading dissidents and human rights activist Wei Jingsheng.  Tong described being interrogated by police at a detention center in Beijing about what Wei had said to US dignitaries. “They were truly afraid that the US might listen to Wei,” she said.   Tong argued that the US must confront its own role in the development current state of affairs.    “In the US, we need to face the fact that we have helped to feed the baby dragon of the CCP until it has grown into what it now is,” she said. “Since the 1990’s US companies have enriched themselves by exploiting cheap labor in China and have in the process also enriched the CCP,” she added.   “I am a proud immigrant citizen of the US, and I want my country to do better,” Tong said.  Ahead of the hearing, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have worked to set a tone of cooperation for the panel.  The US-China relationship has garnered heightened attention in the wake of the US shooting down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon, an incident that took place in early February after the balloon had traveled across the continental US. China has denied the vehicle was used for spying, saying instead it was a research airship blown off course and accusing US of overreacting to the incident.  McMaster was asked during the hearing what message China was sending to the US with the balloon. “I think the message is that we are intending to continue a broad range of surveillance activities. The balloon, I think, is in many ways a metaphor for the massive effort at espionage,” he said. “The balloon is important to look at but placing the balloon in context is perhaps most important.”   In a display of unity across party lines, the House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution condemning China’s use of the suspected surveillance balloon. The measure passed unanimously with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 419 to zero.   This story has been updated with additional developments.

House panel votes to advance bill empowering Biden to ban TikTok    			By Brian Fung, CNN		  Updated  10:51 AM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackForget influencers. 'Deinfluencing' is now a thing    01:44   - Source:CNN Business    WashingtonCNN      A powerful House committee voted to advance legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier to ban TikTok from the United States and crack down on other China-related economic activity, amid vocal objections from some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates who argue the proposal is unconstitutionally broad and threatens a wide range of online speech.  The legislation — introduced Friday and fast-tracked by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul — would empower the Biden administration to impose a nationwide TikTok ban under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).   Adobe StockAgencies have 30 days to ban TikTok on government devices, White House saysThe bill’s text specifically names TikTok and its parent, ByteDance, and requires President Joe Biden to impose penalties against the companies, up to and potentially including a ban, if the administration determines they may have knowingly transferred TikTok’s user data to “any foreign person” working for or under the influence of the Chinese government.   Sanctions would also be required if the Biden administration finds the companies helped the Chinese government engage in surveillance, hacking, censorship or intelligence-gathering; facilitated election meddling in the United States or in another democratic ally; or helped the Chinese government influence US policymaking, among other things.  The bill, known as H.R. 1153 or the Deterring America’s Technological Adversaries Act, also weakens a 35-year-old law, known as the Berman Amendment to IEEPA, that prohibited the US government from restricting the free flow of “informational materials” such as movies, photos, news and eventually electronic media to and from foreign countries, even those under US sanction. Legal experts and even some TikTok creators have cited the Berman Amendment as a potential barrier to a nationwide TikTok ban because it may violate the Berman Amendment’s protections for electronic information.  The legislation considered this week specifies that “sensitive personal data” does not qualify for the Berman Amendment’s protections, allowing the US government to impose restrictions on the international flow of data under IEEPA.   The legislation reflects US lawmakers’ urgency amid fears that TikTok or ByteDance could be pressured by the Chinese government to hand over the personal information of its US users. US officials have said that the data could benefit China by facilitating targeted misinformation campaigns or by providing it with intelligence targets.   In a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter called for the Biden administration to finalize a proposed national security deal that has been in the works for years and that is designed to address those concerns.   “A U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide,” TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said in a statement. “We’re disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok.”  In an earlier statement, Oberwetter called for the Biden administration to finalize a proposed national security deal that has been in the works for years and that is designed to address concerns. “TikTok Inc. is a U.S. company bound by U.S. law,” Oberwetter said, “and we are two years and $1.5 billion dollars deep into a project to go above and beyond existing law to secure the U.S. version of the TikTok platform.”A lengthy debateThe vote followed a lengthy debate Tuesday by panel members who were split along party lines on the proposal. McCaul and other Republicans argued that the risks of allowing TikTok to continue operating in the United States were too great and that Congress must act quickly, citing the federal government’s TikTok ban affecting official devices.  “How can we ban TikTok among ourselves and not ban it for our children? That is the moral question of today and of our time,” McCaul said Tuesday. “TikTok is a modern-day Trojan horse of the [Chinese Communist Party] used to surveil and exploit Americans’ personal information… in other words, it’s a spy balloon in your phone.”  Missouri Republican Rep. Ann Wagner called TikTok “an urgent, urgent issue of supreme national security risk,” adding: “There is clear and present danger; the timing and the urgency are necessary.”  But Democrats pushed back, saying the public had had just days to consider the bill before McCaul brought the legislation to a vote. The legislation’s breadth would unintentionally affect US and European businesses, they said. The panel’s top Democrat, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, warned that Taiwanese and Korean chipmakers could all be harmed by the bill at a time when the US government is trying to entice those same companies to build chip manufacturing plants in the United States.  “This legislation would damage our allegiances across the globe, bring more countries into China’s sphere, destroy jobs here in the United States and undercut core American values of free speech and free enterprise,” Meeks said. “The legislation before us today is unvetted and dangerously overbroad.”  Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline expressed confusion about how the bill tackles “recommendation algorithms,” saying the term is not defined in the legislation, suggesting that the bill could have extensive impacts on the artificial intelligence algorithms that have come to play a massive role in the digital economy.   Several critics of McCaul’s legislation proposed amendments to protect video game companies, including Riot Games and Epic Games, which are owned by the Chinese company Tencent or count it as a large stakeholder, from being unintentionally swept up by the bill.   California Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, who proposed one of the amendments to create a carveout for Riot Games, called the bill “ill-conceived,” “hastily drafted,” and “precipitous.”   The amendments were defeated, and the underlying bill was approved 24-16 along party lines. The bill must still receive a vote on the House floor and in the Senate. Fears for free expressionOn Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union on blasted the legislation as “vague and overbroad,” and accused lawmakers of rushing the bill to a committee vote within days of its introduction without holding a hearing on the proposal.  In seeking to restrict access to a specific social media platform, the bill risks violating Americans’ First Amendment rights to free expression, the ACLU said.  Under the bill, the US government could seek to impose similar penalties and restrictions on any US citizen who “may transfer sensitive personal data” to “any foreign person” who is “subject to the jurisdiction” or “is otherwise subject to the influence of China.”  But terms such as “may be facilitating” or “subject to the influence of China” could be broadly interpreted to encompass a wide range of innocuous economic activity, and could expose Americans to enormous legal risk, the ACLU wrote in a letter to McCaul and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks.   “It would be impossible for the average person to know what the term ‘subject to the influence of China’ means, and the term is not defined in the legislation,” the letter said. “Would an entity be under the influence of China if the CEO’s sister had moved there, or married a Chinese person? Would an entity be under the influence of China if the CEO regularly travels there for leisure?”  The ACLU also took aim at the bill’s proposed changes to the Berman Amendment, calling them a “slippery slope” that could lead to further efforts to chip away at the law that would “leave U.S. residents without some of their favorite international books, movies, and artwork.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Camp toy store pleads for help after Silicon Valley Bank collapse    Mar 11, 2023  Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

Ever bigger cars pose a growing problem for the environment because they produce more planet-heating pollution and need larger batteries, according to the International Energy Agency.Michael Probst/APCNN      While global car sales might have fallen in 2022, one type of car, with an especially large climate footprint, had a great year: The SUV.   Last year sports utility vehicles accounted for nearly half of all cars sold, with particular growth in the US, India and Europe, according to the International Energy Agency.   This boom comes at a climate cost.   The amount of planet-heating carbon pollution produced by the 330 million SUVs now on the world’s roads rose to around 1 billion tons in 2022. To put that in perspective, if SUVs were a country, they would easily be in the top 10 world’s highest carbon-polluters.   There was some good news for electric cars. While car markets in general shrunk due to factors including supply chain shortages and inflation, electric cars bucked the trend.  Last year, global electric car sales rose by about 60%, exceeding 10 million for the first time, according to the IEA. More than a quarter of cars sold in China were electric, one in five in the European Union and nearly one in 10 in the US.   However, the big increase in electric cars was not enough to offset the growing carbon-pollution impact of SUVs, the majority of which are gas-powered.   An electric vehicle is plugged into a charger in Los Angeles, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2022. Jae C. Hong/APElectric vehicle sales hit a tipping point in 2022These heavier vehicles are less fuel efficient than smaller cars, on average consuming about 20% more fuel than the average medium-sized car, according to the IEA.  While the number of electric SUVs is increasing – last year they made up more than half of global electric car sales and 16% of total SUV sales – they also come with problems. Their bigger batteries require more materials such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel, which adds to pressure on supply chains.   “Carmakers are culling small cars in pursuit of profit,” Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility at Transport & Environment, told CNN by email. “But larger cars put more pressure on the planet as they need more materials and energy,” she added.  “For drivers, this means more expensive models and higher running costs, especially at a time of high energy prices. Ultimately, Western carmakers might come to regret this,” Poliscanova said.   The IEA called for or car makers to decrease the average car size and invest in battery technologies. “Rapidly increasing the number of electric cars on the road in place of conventional cars is a key part of reaching net zero emissions by mid-century,” it said.

The Chasing Life podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta dives into the science behind how technology is impacting our brains. Listen now.CNN      TikTok announced Wednesday that every user under 18 will soon have their accounts default to a one-hour daily screen time limit, in one of the most aggressive moves yet by a social media company to prevent teens from endlessly scrolling.   Teenage TikTok users will be able to turn off this new default setting, which will roll out in the coming weeks. But the feature change could bolster the digital well-being of younger users by requiring them to opt out of stricter screen time limits rather than clearing the higher bar of opting in to them.   Photo taken on Oct. 17, 2021 shows the TikTok booth at the 2021 Hangzhou International E-commerce Expo in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesTikTok might be too big to ban, no matter what lawmakers sayIf the 60-minute limit is reached, users will be prompted to enter a passcode — requiring them to make an active decision to extend their time spent swiping through videos on the app.  The move comes after TikTok and other social media platforms have faced years of scrutiny over their impact on young users, including their potential to lead teens down harmful rabbit holes. TikTok is also facing mounting pressure from Washington over security concerns from its ties to China through parent company Bytedance, including renewed discussion of a possible US ban of the short-form video app.  Cormac Keenan, TikTok’s head of trust and safety, said the company consulted researchers and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital when deciding the time limits to set for teen users.   “While there’s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is ‘too much’, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,” Keenan wrote in a blog post.  TikTokKeenan added that if a teen decides to turn off this new default limit and spends more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they will be prompted to set a daily screen time limit for themselves. “In our first month of testing, this approach increased the use of our screen time management tools by 234%,” Keenan wrote.  Keenan also announced some updates to the app’s Family Pairing feature, which allows a parent or caregiver to link their TikTok account to their teen’s and set controls. Parents will be able to filter videos with words or hashtags they don’t want to appear in their teen’s feed, set a custom daily screen time limit for their teen, and set a custom schedule to mute TikTok notifications sent to their teen.   Other platforms including Instagram and Snapchat have similarly rolled out additional parental controls and features that encourage teens to take a break and set boundaries.

While GOP leaders are supportive of the move to release the footage – which was one of the many concessions McCarthy made in his bid to become speaker – some lawmakers in the closed-door leadership meeting asked whether sensitive security protocols or certain evacuation routes would be exposed by taking that step.   Others questioned how long the footage is going to be dragged out in the press, with some lawmakers concerned about the optics of appearing to try to downplay a deadly insurrection in the US Capitol.   “Let’s just rip the Band-aid off and get this over with,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN.  Sources said McCarthy assured his leadership team that he wants to move swiftly, but said they need to be deliberate about how they handle it to ensure the release does not endanger their security. He also told lawmakers that other media outlets will get access to the footage after Carlson airs his exclusive, but it could take a few weeks.  CNN, along with a group of other media organizations, has signed on to a letter calling for congressional leaders to grant access to the security footage from the riot.  A congressional source familiar with the matter said there were ongoing discussions with the Capitol Police about what restrictions should be placed on the footage and that it remained unclear exactly what limitations would be on the video that Carlson will be allowed to air. But even giving Carlson the video footage has spawned widespread concerns, given the conservative host has pushed conspiracy theories about the attack and downplayed the violence at the hands of Trump supporters.  House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York confirmed that the topic came up in their leadership meeting and said she fully supports McCarthy’s decision to publicly release the footage. She also said Republicans would ensure that law enforcement and security protocols are protected.  “Unlike Democrats, we do work very effectively with the Capitol Police. And we respect law enforcement,” Stefanik told CNN. “This is about transparency.”  McCarthy, who initially told reporters he would answer questions on Monday, left the Capitol and avoided reporters and questions about the matter. McCarthy defended his decision to publicly release the footage during a closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday morning, according to sources in the room.   McCarthy said the release was an important step in the name of transparency and argued that there wasn’t outcry when the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection showed clips at their public hearings of then-Vice President Mike Pence’s evacuation. That select committee never revealed Pence’s exact escape route but showed photos of him in the garage where he was hiding during the riot.  One of McCarthy’s closest allies, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene – who also has downplayed the January 6 attack – backed his decision to give the footage to Carlson. She told CNN on Monday she played a role in McCarthy’s decision, but she wouldn’t go into further detail.   Greene, who was not in the Monday night meeting, said she’s spoken with McCarthy, and that the speaker’s office is coordinating a process for how to release the footage more widely, beyond Fox News, while also ensuring it doesn’t violate any security concerns.   “We can’t give away our national security,” Greene said, “Everyone in Congress agrees. And I think the American people agree. We don’t want Russia or China or any of these other countries being able to study all the entries and exits of our capital. That’s foolish.”  Greene told CNN that Carlson’s team was also given certain parameters for what they could and couldn’t air. “Yes … of course (there were parameters) they’re being extremely careful and responsible.”   “I think it is any day now,” Greene told CNN of when to expect some of the footage to air on Fox News.  Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who urged the speaker to release the footage as McCarthy was courting his vote for the speakership, would not say if that was part of the commitment made to encourage him to vote “present” and help the California Republican’s cause.  “I think it’s getting released,” Gaetz told CNN of the security footage.  Top Democrats, too, are closely monitoring the matter.  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said he and McCarthy “have not had an extended conversation” yet about releasing the footage to Carlson.   “But I look forward to talking to him this week and further about figuring out an approach that makes sense and respects the security concerns that many members have articulated in the House,” Jeffries said of the speaker.  Top Democrats are waiting to see what footage is ultimately released before taking position on whether the full media should also have access to it, a source familiar with the matter said.  Asked if he believed the footage should be released widely to the media, Jeffries told CNN: “I have no comment on that right now.”  Other Democrats were outraged at the speaker.  Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chaired the select committee on January 6, told CNN that McCarthy “opened up a can of worms” by agreeing to release the footage to Carlson and dinged the California Republican for fundraising off the move, which he said puts “the institution at risk.”  This story has been updated with additional developments.CNN’s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.

India, world’s largest democracy, leads global list of internet shutdowns    			By Rhea Mogul, CNN		  Updated  3:30 AM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!   Paramilitary soldiers patrol a street during a protest march on June 10, 2022 in Srinagar, India.Waseem Andrabi/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesCNN      India imposed the highest number of internet shutdowns globally in 2022, a new report has revealed, in what critics say is yet another blow to the country’s commitment to freedom of speech and access to information.   Of 187 internet shutdowns recorded worldwide, 84 took place in India, according to the report published Tuesday by Access Now, a New York based advocacy group that tracks internet freedom.  This is the fifth consecutive year the world’s largest democracy of more than 1.3 billion people has topped the list, the group said, raising concerns about India’s commitment to internet freedom under its current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.   “The responsibility of Indian states for the majority of shutdowns globally is impossible to ignore and a deep problem on its own,” the report said. “Authorities in regions across the country are increasingly resorting to this repressive measure, inflicting shutdowns on more people in more places.”   Nearly 60% of India’s internet shutdowns last year occurred in Indian-administered Kashmir, where authorities disrupted access due to “political instability and violence,” according to the report.   In August 2019, the BJP revoked the autonomy of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir and split it into two federally administered territories, bringing the region under greater control of New Delhi. The unprecedented decision sparked protests and the government has frequently restricted communication lines since, a move rights groups say is aimed at quashing dissent.   Apart from Jammu and Kashmir, authorities in the states of West Bengal and Rajasthan imposed more shutdowns than other Indian regions in response to “protests, communal violence and exams,” according to the report.   India has the world’s second largest digital population, following China, with more than 800 million internet users. The internet has become a vital social and economic lifeline for large swathes of the population and connects the country’s isolated rural pockets, with its growing cities.  The disruptions “impacted the daily lives of millions of people for hundreds of hours in 2022,” the report said. Concerns in IndiaThe Access Now report comes at a time when India’s commitment to freedom of speech and expression is under increasing scrutiny.   In January, the country banned a documentary from the BBC that was critical of Modi’s alleged role in deadly riots more than 20 years ago. Indian tax authorities raided the BBC’s offices in New Delhi and Mumbai in the weeks that followed citing “irregularities and discrepancies” in the broadcaster’s taxes.   But critics of the government were not convinced, instead calling the raids “a clear cut case of vendetta” and accused the BJP of intimidating the media.   Last week, police in New Delhi arrested a senior opposition politician for allegedly “disturbing harmony” after he misstated the Prime Minister’s middle name, a move Modi’s critics likened to “dictatorial behavior.”   People line up to cast their votes for first phase of India's General Elections in April 2019.Pradeep Guar/Mint/Getty ImagesIn recent years, the government has repeatedly justified blocking internet access on the grounds of preserving public safety amid widespread fears of mob violence.  While the country was in the middle of its general election in 2019, with more than 900 million people eligible to vote, some Indians were denied access to the internet for days at a time as they prepared to cast their ballots.  Authorities said the blocking was “a precautionary measure to maintain law and order,” leading many critics to question India’s grand exercise in political freedom during the world’s largest election.   During a nearly year-long protest by angry farmers in 2021 over controversial new pricing laws, the Indian government blocked internet access in several districts after violent skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and police.

Apart from India, other countries that saw internet shutdowns last year include Ukraine, Iran and Myanmar.   During Russia’s invasion of it neighbor Ukraine, the Kremlin cut internet access at least 22 times, according to Access Now, engaging in “cyberattacks and deliberately destroying telecommunications infrastructure.”   The Iranian regime responded to protests ignited by the death in custody of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini by imposing 18 shutdowns – a move Access Now called “a further escalation of its repressive tactics.”  Myanmar, which in 2021 saw the junta remove its democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, saw seven internet blackouts, according to the report. The Southeast Asian country continues to be rocked by violence and instability, while many are grappling with shortages of fuel, food and basic supplies  The “military persisted in keeping people in the dark for extended periods, targeting areas where coup resistance is strongest,” the report said.

China’s factories just had their best month in nearly 11 years as economy rebounds after reopening    			By Laura He, CNN		  Published  12:49 AM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!

In January, the reading was 50.1, a sharp increase from the month before, as disruptions caused by the abrupt end of pandemic restrictions was starting to fade. China scrapped most of those restrictions in early December.

The official non-manufacturing PMI for February, which includes the construction and services industries, recorded its best level in two years, figures from the NBS showed. The reading was at 56.3, compared to 54.4 in January.  Also Wednesday, the Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI, a private gauge of the country’s factory activity, jumped to 51.6 in February from 49.2 in January. It was the first expansion in seven months.  The official PMIs mainly cover larger businesses and state-owned companies, while the Caixin readings are more focused on smaller businesses and private companies.   The robust data has boosted Asian stocks. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up more than 3%, leading gains in the region, and poised to record the biggest daily increase in three months.

On Wednesday, Moody’s Investors Services raised its forecast for China’s real GDP growth to 5% for both 2023 and 2024, up from 4% previously, citing a “stronger than expected” rebound in the short term after the government fully relaxed Covid restrictions.

US is reviewing Huawei export license policy amid rising congressional scrutiny of China    			By Brian Fung, CNN		  Published  2:26 PM EST, Tue February 28, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackEnergy Dept intel:Covid may have come from lab    02:53   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      The US government is reviewing a policy that permits certain US exports to continue to Huawei, despite an overall push by the Trump and Biden administrations to block the Chinese telecommunications giant from receiving American technology.  Alan Estevez, a Commerce Department official, told lawmakers Tuesday that the policy is “under assessment” as the agency conducts a “top-to-bottom review of our export control policies related to the [People’s Republic of China].”  Estevez testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which was holding a hearing to scrutinize China’s impact on US national security.   In 2019, Huawei was one of a number of Chinese companies placed on the Commerce Department’s Entity List, which prohibits US companies from trading specified items with entities named on the list unless they obtain a license to do so.   US officials have expressed concerns that Huawei’s 5G wireless networking gear could allow the Chinese government to spy on American communications. Huawei has denied that it poses a security risk, and its founder has said the company would resist any Chinese government effort to obtain its data.   According to Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul, between January and March of 2022 the Commerce Department approved more than $23 billion in license applications to trade with Chinese-affiliated companies on the Entity List. Confronting Estevez at Tuesday’s hearing, McCaul asked the Commerce Department to square the license approvals with the US government’s wider effort to sideline Huawei and similar companies.   “A licensing rule of the previous administration that still stands for Huawei allows things below 5G, below cloud-level to go,” Estevez said, “and I will say that all those things are under assessment.”  Entity List restrictions do not provide for a “blanket embargo” on exports generally, Estevez added, but rather reflect specific rules about particular exports.   Separately, in 2020 the Commerce Department moved to prevent Huawei’s suppliers from selling the company semiconductor chips made by US-built software and equipment, unless those suppliers also obtained a license.  Other parts of the US government have also moved against Huawei. The Federal Communications Commission has prohibited US wireless carriers from using federal funding to purchase Huawei networking gear, and last year also banned future approvals of Huawei equipment for sale in the United States, in the first use of the FCC’s equipment authorization authority for a national security purpose.

But even those who spend their days tracking its movement across oceans struggle to work out exactly who is ferrying it.   As Western sanctions against Russia have escalated over its invasion of Ukraine, more ships have joined an existing fleet of mysterious tankers, ready to facilitate Russia’s oil exports.  Industry insiders estimate the size of that “shadow” fleet at roughly 600 vessels, or about 10% of the global number of large tankers. And numbers continue to climb.  Who owns and operates many of these ships remains a puzzle. As trading Russian oil became more complex over the past year, many Western shippers withdrew their services. New, obscure players swooped in, with shell companies in Dubai or Hong Kong involved in some cases. Some bought boats from Europeans, while others tapped old, creaking ships that might have otherwise ended up in the scrapyard.  “You’ve gone deeper into the dark arts,” a senior executive at an oil trading firm told CNN, referring to this opaque network.  The under-the-radar fleet has increased in importance as Moscow tries to avoid working with Western shippers, and as customers in China and India supplant those in Europe, now banned from purchasing seaborne Russian oil and refined products such as diesel. Delivery to more distant buyers requires additional boats — and ship owners willing to deal with added complexity and legal risk, especially after Group of Seven countries imposed price caps on Russian oil.

Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe expansion of the shadow fleet highlights the dramatic changes Russia’s war has brought to the global oil market. In its bid to keep operating, the world’s second-largest crude exporter has reshaped decades-old trading patterns and split the world’s energy system in two.  “There’s the fleet that is not doing any Russian business, and then there’s the fleet that’s almost exclusively doing Russian business,” said Richard Matthews, head of research at EA Gibson, an international shipbroker. Only a few ships, he added, are doing a “bit of both.”‘Gray ships’ and ‘dark ships’As Europe has weaned itself off Russian energy, buyers in Asia have cut deals. China boosted imports of Russian oil to 1.9 million barrels per day on average in 2022, up 19% from 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. India ramped up purchases even more sharply, logging an 800% increase to an average of 900,000 barrels per day.   Russia’s oil exports to China and India both hit record highs in January after Europe’s ban on seaborne Russian oil took effect, according to Kpler, a data and analytics company. Exports to Turkey, another top customer, also continued apace. (The ban on refined oil products did not kick in until February.)  Filling these orders requires boats amenable to the trip. Russia’s national fleet doesn’t have enough vessels. That’s where the “shadow fleet” comes in.  Matthew Wright, senior freight analyst at Kpler, sorts the boats moving Russian crude into two categories: “gray ships” and “dark ships.” Gray ships have been sold since the invasion — mostly by owners in Europe to firms in the Middle East and Asia that weren’t previously active in the tanker market. Dark ships, on the other hand, are veterans of campaigns by Iran and Venezuela to avoid Western sanctions that have recently switched to carrying Russian crude.  “There is often some evidence that they have been disguising their activities by turning off their AIS transponder,” Wright said of the “dark” ships, referring to technology that helps identify and locate vessels.

VCG/VCG/Getty Images/FileChina is helping to prop up the Russian economy. Here's howWhile Western countries have banned most Russian oil imports, there aren’t any rules preventing Western ships from delivering to buyers such as China and India, or from providing services such as insurance — so long as the G7 price caps are respected. Ships with European owners accounted for 36% of Russian crude trade in January, according to Kpler.  But the legal and reputational risks of failing to comply with the price caps loom large. At the same time, Russia is eager to stop working with Western shippers. That has led to the development of a new cohort, whose makeup is murkier — and history more checkered.  “The dark fleet that has been around carrying Venezuelan and Iranian oil globally is something we all expected to grow, and it has,” said Janiv Shah, senior analyst at Rystad Energy, a consultancy.  One reason: Sending Russian oil on longer trips to China or India is less efficient than shipping it to nearby countries such as Finland. Russia now needs four times as much shipping capacity for its crude as it did before the invasion, according to EA Gibson.  As a result, an estimated 25 to 35 vessels are being sold per month into the shadow fleet, according to another senior executive at an oil trading firm. Global Witness, a nonprofit, estimates that a quarter of oil tanker sales between late February 2022 and January this year involved unknown buyers, roughly double the proportion the previous year.  Demand could increase in the coming months if China needs more fuel to power its economic recovery.Questions and risksIf a greater percentage of the global fleet is being used for Russian crude and petroleum products, that eats up capacity, raising costs for all oil traders.  “There’s been a massive increase in inefficiencies in the way the tanker market operates,” said Wright of Kpler.  There are also questions about who ultimately runs the shadow fleet. Some suspect a portion of the shell companies that have cropped up have ties to “the Russian state or certain politically connected players,” according to Sergey Vakulenko, a former executive at a Russian oil company, now nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The likelihood of there being a major spill or accident is growing by the day.”Richard Matthews, head of research at EA Gibson  This past weekend, the European Union imposed sanctions on Sun Ship Management, a subsidiary of Sovcomflot, Russia’s largest shipping company. The EU said the Dubai-based firm, registered a decade ago, had been “operating as one of the key companies managing and operating the maritime transport of Russian oil,” and that the “Russian Federation is the ultimate beneficiary” of its business operations.  Moreover, experts have said the shadow fleet may be easing Russia’s ability to dodge sanctions or sell its oil above the price cap. It’s also making it harder to discern exactly how much Russia’s barrels are selling for. Experts including Vakulenko have found evidence in customs data that Urals, the country’s benchmark, is selling for much more at key ports than official prices indicate.    Safety is also a worry. The dark fleet is believed to have a large contingent of vessels older than 15 years, the age at which mainstream oil companies would typically retire them due to wear and tear. Now, more of these boats are making trips across the globe.  “You’ve got all these old vessels that are probably not being maintained to the standard they should be,” said Matthews of EA Gibson. “The likelihood of there being a major spill or accident is growing by the day as this fleet grows.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko arrives in Beijing on February 28, 2023. Maxim Gucheck/BELTA/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      A key autocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in China for a state visit on Tuesday, amid warnings from United States officials that Beijing may be considering aiding Moscow in its ongoing assault on Ukraine.   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will stay in China until Thursday and meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss a range of issues from trade and investment to “acute international challenges,” Belarus’ state news agency Belta reported Tuesday after confirming the leader’s arrival.  His trip comes after the two leaders agreed to upgrade their countries’ ties to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” during a September meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Uzbekistan, which Putin also attended.  Lukashenko met with outgoing Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday and called for the two countries to “intensify” their relations, according to a readout from the Belarusian government.  “We have no closed topics for cooperation. We cooperate in all avenues,” Lukashenko told Li, per the readout, adding “we have never set ourselves the task of … working against third countries.”   Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday reported that Lukashenko visited Beijing’s Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath in front of the Monument to the People’s Heroes, which honors revolutionary figures in the Chinese Communist Party.  The visit from the Belarusian leader – who allowed Russian troops to use Belarus to stage their initial incursion into Ukraine last year – comes as tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent weeks, including over concerns from Washington that Beijing is considering sending lethal aid to the Kremlin’s struggling war effort.   In some of the most specific comments to date about the US response to any such support, Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a trip to Kazakhstan on Tuesday warned that Washington would target Chinese firms or citizens involved in any effort to send lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine.  Video Ad FeedbackReport obtained by CNN shows Russia is getting military support from China    04:37   - Source:CNNBeijing has pushed back on claims it is considering sending lethal aid, with its Foreign Ministry on Monday saying China was “actively promoting peace talks and the political settlement of the crisis,” while the US was “pouring lethal weapons into the battlefield in Ukraine.”  And despite its “no-limits” partnership with Russia, China claims to be a neutral party to the Ukraine conflict.  Jake Sullivan.Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesUS says China will face 'real costs' if it provides lethal aid to Russia for war in UkraineOn Friday, Beijing released a 12-point position on the “political solution” to the crisis in a document calling for peace talks to end the year-long war. Its release, however, was criticized by Western leaders, who accused China of already having taken Russia’s side.  Xi has yet to speak with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky since Russia’s invasion began, though he has spoken with Putin on multiple occasions, including in person during the SCO summit.  In an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua released ahead of his visit, Lukashenko is cited as saying the position paper was a testimony to China’s peaceful foreign policy and a new and original step that would have a far-reaching impact.  While burgeoning economic ties between China and Belarus are expected to be a key component of talks this week, the conflict in Ukraine will loom over discussions.  Video Ad FeedbackSee why Ukraine thinks Russia will launch new offensive from Belarus    03:05   - Source:CNNBelarus has been targeted by sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies in response to Moscow’s aggression after Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border north of Kyiv.   Belarus already had fraught relations with Western powers, with the European Union not recognizing the results of Lukashenko’s 2020 election win – which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the country and were followed by a brutal government crackdown.  There have been fears throughout the conflict in Ukraine that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another Russian offensive, or that Lukashenko’s own troops would join the war. Before visiting Moscow earlier this month, Lukashenko claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked.   Video Ad FeedbackHear the message the Belarusian president told a CNN reporter to relay to Biden    03:10   - Source:CNNThe backdrop of Belarus’ damaged ties with the West – and an interest in diversifying a Russia-dependent economy – could see Lukashenko keen to focus on boosting economic ties with China during this visit.   Belarus was an early joiner of China’s Belt and Road development initiative, launched a decade ago, and trade between the two last year increased 33% year-on-year to surpass $5 billion, according to Xinhua.  In a call between Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and his Belarussian counterpart Sergei Aleinik on Friday, Qin pledged that China would “support Belarus in its efforts to safeguard national stability and development,” and “oppose external interference in Belarus’s internal affairs and illegal unilateral sanctions against the country,” according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout.  On Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a regular briefing that Lukashenko’s visit would be “an opportunity to pursue further progress in the all-round cooperation between the two countries.”    CNN’s Wayne Chang, Frederik Pleitgen, Zahra Ullah, Claudia Otto and Rob Picheta contributed reporting.

EU bans TikTok from official devices across all three government institutions    			By Xiaofei Xu, Eve Brennan and James Frater, CNN		  Updated  3:31 AM EST, Wed March 1, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackExperts raising alarm over 'crisis' of TikTok's impact on mental health    03:12   - Source:CNNParis/LondonCNN      The European Parliament on Tuesday banned TikTok from staff devices over cybersecurity concerns, meaning the Chinese video-sharing app is now barred in all three of the EU’s main institutions.  “In view of cybersecurity concerns, in particular regarding data protection and collection of data by third parties, the European Parliament has decided, in alignment with other institutions, to suspend as from 20 March 2023, the use of the TikTok mobile application on corporate devices,” it said in a statement.  The parliament also “strongly recommended” that its members and staff remove TikTok from their personal devices.  TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, told CNN “it’s disappointing to see that other government bodies and institutions are banning TikTok on employee devices with no deliberation or evidence.”   “These bans are based on basic misinformation about our company, and we are readily available to meet with officials to set the record straight about our ownership structure and our commitment to privacy and data security. We share a common goal with governments that are concerned about user privacy, but these bans are misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security,” a spokesperson said in a statement.  “We appreciate that some governments have wisely chosen not to implement such bans due to a lack of evidence that there is any such need.”   Adobe StockEuropean Commission bans TikTok from official devicesLast week, the European Commission announced it was banning TikTok from official devices, citing cybersecurity concerns.    A senior EU official in the European Council told CNN that the General Secretariat of the Council, the body that assists the permanent representatives of the EU’s 27 countries based in Brussels, “is in the process of implementing measures similar to those taken by the Commission.”   “It will be uninstalling the application on corporate devices and requesting staff to uninstall it from personal mobile devices that have access to corporate services,” the official added. “The Secretariat continuously keeps its cybersecurity measures under review in close cooperation with the other EU institutions.”  The European Commission said last week their decision to ban TikTok applies only to devices overseen by the EU’s executive branch.    “This measure aims to protect the Commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyber-attacks against the corporate environment of the Commission,” it said in a statement.    A TikTok spokesperson told CNN in a statement at the time that it had contacted the commission to “set the record straight and explain how we protect the data of the 125 million people across the EU who come to TikTok every month.”  Previously, TikTok had disclosed to European users that China-based employees may access EU user data. The company also recently announced plans to open two new data centers in Europe.Agencies banTikTok is facing similar scrutiny across the Atlantic.  On Monday, the White House directed federal agencies to remove TikTok from all government-issued devices within 30 days, with few exceptions.   The move added to growing efforts by the United States to clampdown on the app amid renewed security concerns.   Adobe StockAgencies have 30 days to ban TikTok on government devices, White House saysUS officials have raised concerns that the Chinese government could pressure ByteDance to hand over information collected from users that could be used for intelligence or disinformation purposes. As CNN has previously reported, independent security experts have said that type of access is a possibility, though there has been no reported incident of such access to date.  Brooke Oberwetter, a TikTok spokesperson, called the ban “little more than political theater.”  “The ban of TikTok on federal devices passed in December without any deliberation, and unfortunately that approach has served as a blueprint for other world governments,” Oberwetter said in a statement.   “We hope that when it comes to addressing national security concerns about TikTok beyond government devices, Congress will explore solutions that won’t have the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans.”  China also hit back at the decision Tuesday, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson accusing Washington of “generalizing the concept of national security” and “unreasonably suppressing enterprises of other countries.”  Adobe StockCanada bans TikTok on government devicesThe Canadian government announced a similar ban on TikTok from official electronic devices on Monday.  Other nations may soon have to grapple with the same issue.   Asked whether Australia would soon follow the United States, European Union and Canada, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the country hadn’t yet been advised to restrict use of the app by government workers.   “We’ll take the advice of our national security agencies. That hasn’t been the advice to date,” Chalmers told Australia’s ABC broadcaster in an interview on Wednesday.    CNN’s Brian Fung, Jack Forrest and Michelle Toh contributed to this report.

In the most specific public admonition on the issue to Beijing so far, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken underlined that arming Moscow’s forces would cause China serious problems around the world.  “China can’t have it both ways when it comes to … the Russian aggression in Ukraine. It can’t be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand, while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand,” Blinken said in Kazakhstan.  US officials have spent the past 10 days warning that it has intelligence that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia, causing fury in Beijing and underscoring how already deteriorating diplomatic relations are being rocked by almost daily crises – from a recent spy balloon controversy to a revived dispute over the specific origins of Covid-19. On Monday evening, the White House gave federal agencies a 30-day deadline to remove TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, from federal devices. And later Tuesday, a new House select committee will hold its first hearing on the fast-widening US-China rivalry.  In his clearest comments about how the US would respond if China did decide to help its ally Russia with lethal aid, Blinken spoke of punishments for Chinese firms that could cause Beijing to pay an economic price.  “We did very clearly warn China about the implications and consequences of going through with providing such support,” referring to his own meeting with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in Munich this month and President Joe Biden’s talks with President Xi Jinping in Indonesia in November 2022.  “We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, or otherwise engaged in supporting the Russian war effort,” he said.   New confrontations – along with rising tensions between US and Chinese forces in Asia and escalating standoffs over Taiwan – are dramatizing a long-building and once theoretical superpower rivalry that is suddenly a daily reality.

Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAssessment Covid-19 leaked from Chinese lab is a minority view within US intel community, sources sayThis increasingly adversarial relationship touches multiple areas of American life – from the economy to public health. It spans the challenges faced by the US military, which are amid the great geopolitical clashes of the early 21st century like in Ukraine to risks posed by the Chinese-designed apps on the electronic devices everyone carries everywhere. It’s fueling the dangerous possibility that the US and China are locked into a potentially disastrous slide toward conflict. And it poses serious challenges for a polarized US political system that struggles to have a rational debate on these issues without descending into a partisan game of who can be tougher on China. Such one-upmanship only deepens a self-perpetuating cycle of escalation between the two sides.  It is in this politicized atmosphere that the GOP-controlled House is debuting a new bipartisan select committee on competition with China during a primetime hearing on Tuesday night, just as Washington-Beijing tensions have rarely been worse.  The committee’s work will be based on the premise that after years of trying to integrate China peacefully into the global system as a competitor not an enemy, the US is switching to a tougher stance in a belief that a new generation of Chinese leaders is trying to dismantle the US global order and international law.  Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, the new committee’s chairman, told CNN’s Manu Raju that Tuesday’s hearing would not focus specifically on the latest drama – after the Department of Energy assessed with low confidence that the Covid-19 pandemic originated with a lab leak in the Chinese city of Wuhan. He said that finding, which is a minority view among US intelligence agencies, could be examined in a future hearing but that he wanted to show Americans on Tuesday that the threat from China was “not just an over there problem, it’s … right here.”  WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 28:  Nicholas Burns, professor of the practice of diplomacy and international relations at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, testifies before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee June 28, 2017 in Washington, DC.

On CBS News on Sunday, Gallagher warned: “We may call this a strategic competition, but it’s not a tennis match. This is about what type of world we want to live in. Do we want to live in Xinjiang-lite or do we want to live in the free world?” he said, referring to the Chinese region where the US has accused China of inflicting genocide on the Uyghur minority, a charge China continues to vehemently deny.  The committee may be one of the few areas where a divided Congress – and potentially the White House – can find common ground. The Biden administration has reinforced the already tough stance toward China that ex-President Donald Trump adopted later in his presidency. Biden, for instance, last year signed a new law that will allow the government to spend $200 billion in a bid to claim the leadership of the semiconductor chips industry – a critical sector that could decide the economic race between the US and China in decades to come.Covid-19 origin controversy starts new pan-Pacific war of words The new controversy over the origins of Covid-19 is a study in isolation of many of the forces ripping at US-China relations, including US mistrust of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping’s desire to preserve his prestige and that of a political system he holds up as an alternative to Western democracy. US demands for information about the origins of the pandemic show how China is refusing to play by global rules – in this case, in allowing follow-up virological investigations. All of this only exacerbates intense reaction in Washington, and in turn tears at US political fault lines.   There is no consensus within the US government on the origins of the pandemic. Intelligence agencies remain divided over whether it started with animal to human transmission in a Wuhan wet market or originated in a viral leak from a Chinese laboratory – and no new evidence has emerged publicly in support of the lab leak theory. Investigating the origins is hugely important.   “There is a bottom line here, which is that neither lab leak, nor spillover – i.e. animal origin – can be ruled out. We don’t have definitive information,” Tom Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN on Monday.   Security personnel keep watch outside Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organization (WHO) team tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Wuhan, Hubei province, China February 3, 2021.Thomas Peter/Reuters/FileCovid 'lab leak theory': What we've learnedBut it didn’t take long for Republicans to claim political victory in the wake of Sunday’s Wall Street Journal report about new intelligence causing the Department of Energy to believe with low confidence that a lab leak was to blame. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been accused of spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, tweeted, “Conspiracy theorists - 100 Media - 0.”   Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas tweeted: “Re. China’s lab leak, being proven right doesn’t matter. What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn’t happen again.”  Such definitive statements, based on one assessment, do not recognize that the US intelligence community is still divided over the matter. Some Republicans have long sought to prove that the virus was a conspiracy by China to unleash contagion on the world, and many have long appeared to be seeking an explanation for the pandemic that could mask Trump’s negligence in handling it.  But even if the virus did emerge from a laboratory, it doesn’t mean it was necessarily man made or that the rest of the world was deliberately exposed.   China’s foreign ministry reacted angrily to the reemergence of the lab leak theory in Washington, warning that Americans should “stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin.”   In many ways, it doesn’t matter if poor security at a lab in China or animal transmission caused the pandemic that killed nearly seven million people globally, according to World Health Organization figures, and more than a million in the US. Both possible routes of transmission represent a threat to humanity and need to be addressed, which is one reason why China’s lack of transparency on the issue is so potentially dangerous. The pandemic remains a huge embarrassment for China, souring its national mythology of a mighty rising power.   But in Washington this week, the issue has again degenerated into an excuse for Republicans to target scientists and government health experts and to twist a narrative about Covid-19 that still has massive gaps.   The challenge for the new select committee, which is especially probing economic and technological competition with China, will be to break this cycle of politicization to provide a useful examination of US-China relations that could result in effective policy recommendations down the road.The US and China have a new area of confrontation – Ukraine Another example of how the wider antagonism between the United States and China is coloring other crises is evident with Ukraine.  The US, citing unpublished intelligence, has spent the last week warning that China is considering sending lethal aid to bolster Russia’s forces – a situation that would effectively put China on the opposite side of a proxy war with the US and NATO powers that have sent billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine.  Beijing has long amplified Russia’s justifications for the invasion, which took place a year ago shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to the Chinese capital to agree to a friendship with “no limits” with Xi. China would prefer Russia, which shares its autocratic form of government, not to suffer a total defeat in Ukraine – which could lead to the ousting of close ally Putin. And China increasingly tends to view its global interests through the prism of its standoff with the US, so it may perceive an advantage in Washington being locked in an arms-length conflict in Ukraine that is costing billions of dollars and to which it is sending reserve military equipment and ammunition that can therefore not be used to bolster its Pacific forces. Delays in procurement in the US arms industry caused by Ukraine could also slow the flow of weapons to Taiwan.   Yet a decision by China to throw in its lot with Russia in Ukraine would amount to a radical change in foreign policy – and another massive plunge in US-China relations. Washington and the European Union would certainly respond with sanctions on Chinese firms, a threat that will likely give leaders in Beijing pause, as the country’s economy slowly recovers from years of Covid isolation.  “China has never had to incur any costs for its support for Russia. This (would be) the first time – it is a very important crossroads,” Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, said on CNN Monday.   As with the latest Covid-19 drama, China has reacted angrily to US criticism – all of which it appears to view in the wider context of its belief that every US policy is aimed at depriving it of its rightful global influence.  This new front in US-China antagonism is also beginning to seep into US politics. While being tough on Beijing is a bipartisan position, the idea of a broadened conflict in Ukraine conflicts with the more limited view of US power projection abroad among “America First” Republicans. Traditional hawks like Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell strongly support even more US aid for Ukraine, but some conservatives like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – a likely 2024 contender – have warned against escalating conflict. In a rare foreign policy comment last week, he specifically mentioned potential Chinese involvement.  “I don’t think it’s in our interest to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the Borderlands or over Crimea,” DeSantis told “Fox & Friends,” referring to Ukrainian lands Russia has seized with military force.  His comments were a reminder that everything in Washington is ultimately political. And few issues are as politicized as tortured US relations with China.

Volkswagen sees no sign of forced labor at its plant in Xinjiang    			By Reuters  Published  6:24 AM EST, Tue February 28, 2023    Link Copied!   Volkswagen operates its plant in Urumqi, Xinjiang as a joint venture with China's SAIC Motor. China Daily/ReutersVolkswagen faced a barrage of criticism from campaigners Tuesday after the head of its Chinese business said he saw no sign of forced labor during a visit to the carmaker’s plant in Xinjiang.  Activists and an international group of lawmakers said verifying labor standards in the region was impossible.  Rights groups have documented human rights abuses in Xinjiang since the 2000s, including mass forced labor in detention camps which the United Nations said could constitute crimes against humanity. China has denied any abuses in Xinjiang.  Volkswagen’s    (VLKAF) China chief Ralf Brandstaetter spent 1-1/2 days on Feb. 16-17 touring the German group’s facility in the region, which is part of a joint venture with China’s SAIC Motor, along with Volkswagen’s    (VLKAF) compliance and external relations chiefs in China.  Brandstaetter said he saw no signs of forced labor and that workers’ comments matched the reports Volkswagen had received from SAIC about the plant.  “I can talk to people and draw my conclusions. I can try and verify the facts, and that’s what I did. I didn’t find any contradictions,” he said, adding it was his first visit but not his last.  Tesla/WeiboTesla just opened a new showroom in China's Xinjiang regionBut Luke de Pulford of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of legislators from 30 democratic countries including Britain, Germany, and the United States, said human rights organizations felt labor standards could not be verified in the region because members of the Uyghur minority could not speak freely without fearing for their safety.  Campaigners at the World Uyghur Congress in Germany and researchers from Sheffield Hallam University, who authored a report on the auto industry supply chain’s links to Xinjiang, said the visit to the region and conversations with workers were likely planned and coordinated with authorities.  Brandstaetter said he spoke at length to seven workers individually — including Han Chinese, Uyghurs and Kazakhs — some through a translator of Volkswagen’s choice and some in English, and held shorter discussions with other workers on his tour, which he said occurred without government supervision.  The plant, which previously assembled the Santana, has seen 65% staff cuts since the pandemic and only conducts final quality checks and installation of certain features before handing over vehicles to dealers for sale in the region.  Planned output for this year is 10,000, a fraction of the 50,000 targeted when it first opened.Reputational riskVolkswagen says it has never found evidence of forced labor among its Xinjiang workforce and its presence is positive for the local population. It denied maintaining the plant was a condition imposed by Beijing to keep producing cars across China.  The carmaker was initially praised for setting up the plant, chief lobbyist Thomas Steg said, comparing the goal of building infrastructure and boosting living conditions to Germany’s reunification.  But the atmosphere shifted after numerous deadly attacks in Xinjiang and elsewhere between 2009-2014 which the Chinese government blamed on militants from the region, leading to a “significantly more repressive approach,” he said.

Still, Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at top-20 Volkswagen investor Deka Investment, said the reputational risk of retaining the plant could affect the carmaker’s share price.  Already, some funds were shifting their portfolios to exclude Volkswagen shares after index provider MSCI issued a warning on its environmental, social and governance rating for the carmaker because of the plant in November.  “VW is stuck in a situation of reputational risk in Xinjiang,” Speich said.

Read more opinion at CNN.CNN      One year into Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine, it has become clear that neither side is strong enough to win the war nor weak enough to sue for peace. The conflict has settled into a stalemate. After making impressive gains, Ukraine’s armed forces have not made significant advances in months. Russia meanwhile has dug into the territories it occupies, and its further attacks are having little success so far.   Fareed ZakariaThe numbers tell the story. According to a Washington Post analysis, Russia occupied about 7% of Ukrainian territory when it launched its invasion in February 2022. It swept into eastern Ukraine, and in a month it was holding 22% of the country. Then came Ukrainian counter-offensives, which by mid-November had taken back about a third of those gains. In the last three months, nothing significant has changed. Ukraine and Russia are both planning new moves, but it would take massive victories to fundamentally change the situation. To put it another way, Ukraine would need to recover roughly twice as much territory as it was able to last year, just to get back the lands conquered since the 2022 invasion.   Russia’s performance in the war has been poor, but it is doing better, especially at holding territory. Russia has also been able to stabilize its economy, which the IMF projects will do better this year than the UK’s or Germany’s. Russia is trading freely with such economic behemoths as China, and India, as well as neighbors like Turkey and Iran. Because of these countries and many more, outside of the advanced technology sector, it has access to all the goods and capital it lost through the Western boycott. There is now a huge world economy that does not include the West, and Russia can swim in those waters freely. The long-term costs of the war and the effects of the sanctions are real but slow. This kind of isolation and pain rarely changes a dictatorship’s policies – look at North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.

In the short run, there is only one answer for the West and its allies – give Ukraine more weapons and money. If the decision has been made that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression must not be rewarded, then take all steps to make that a reality. With almost every weapons system requested by Ukraine, there is a pattern of ambivalence first, then delay, and then finally agreement. Why not send more, sooner? The next three months are crucial, as the winter thaws and makes troop movements easier.   All that said, however, it is difficult to imagine a World War II style total victory. Most wars end in negotiations. This one is unlikely to be different. The task for the West is to ensure that Ukraine has enough success and momentum on the battlefield that it enters those negotiations with a very strong hand. Only dramatic Ukrainian victories – like cutting off Crimea – will likely bring Putin to the negotiating table.    Is there a way to end the hostilities? On paper, yes. It’s possible to imagine a cease-fire that returns all lands captured since February 2022 to Ukraine. Those taken earlier, like Crimea in 2014, would be subject to international arbitration, including local referendums that would be conducted by international groups, not the Russian government. In addition, Ukraine would get security guarantees from NATO, though they would not apply to those disputed territories. That tradeoff – to put it simply, Crimea and parts of the Donbas for de facto NATO and EU membership – is one that could be sold to Ukrainians because they would achieve their long-cherished goal of becoming part of the West. It could be acceptable to Russia because it could claim to have protected some Russian-speaking parts of Ukraine.    Workers unload civilian bodies in a cemetery in Bucha, Ukraine on April 7, 2022.Rodrigo Abd/APOpinion: In Ukraine, a river of horrors has swelled to a flood There are many who believe that the war can end with a total Ukrainian victory. I hope so, but I doubt it. In 2021, Russia was more than three times bigger than Ukraine in population, almost 15 times bigger in GDP, and spent 10 times more on its defense budget. Russians have been known to have a high capacity for pain in wartime. (The Soviet Union lost 24 million people in World War II compared to America’s 420,000.) And while Russia’s economy is in slow decline, Ukraine’s has fallen off a cliff. GDP contracted by about 30% in 2022, and the government is spending more than double what it takes in (thanks to Western aid).

The war is taking place on Ukrainian soil, with its cities being bombarded to rubble, its factories razed, its people turned destitute.

(Photo by Damon Coulter/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Damon Coulter/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesSeoul, South KoreaCNN      A US Navy reconnaissance jet flew over the Taiwan Strait on Monday, in a maneuver intended to assert the right to operate in international airspace despite strong objections from the Chinese military.   In a statement Monday, the US 7th Fleet said the flight of the P-8A Poseidon over the waterway that separates China and the self-ruled island of Taiwan was conducted in accordance with international law, demonstrating “the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.”  But a spokesman for China’s Eastern Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Army Senior Col. Shi Yi, accused Washington of hyping the flight and inflaming tensions.  The US flight “has deliberately disrupted the regional situation and jeopardized the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Shi said in a report on the PLA’s English language website.  That allegation was amplified in Chinese state media, with a story in the nationalist state-run tabloid Global Times claiming the flight of the US Navy antisubmarine warfare and surveillance jet was “just another provocation aimed at stirring up troubles.”  The US 7th Fleet statement said the US would continue to “fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows including within the Taiwan Strait.”  The Chinese Communist Party claims Taiwan, a democratically ruled island of 24 million people, as part of its sovereign territory despite never having controlled it.  Beijing sends military aircraft and ships into the Taiwan Strait on a daily basis as it keeps up military pressure on the island.   On Tuesday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it spotted 14 PLA aircraft and three naval vessels around the island, including four aircraft that crossed the median line of the strait, which had for decades served as a rarely breached informal demarcation line between the two sides but is now routinely ignored by Beijing.  Tuesday’s PLA deployments were up from four aircraft and three ships spotted by Taiwan on Monday, with none of those crossing the median line.   The US P-8A flight on Monday was the second in less than a week to draw significant attention from the PLA.

U.S. Indo-Pacific CommandVideos show both sides of US-China aerial encounter -- and highlight the risks involvedThe intercept, filmed by the CNN crew, came after a PLA airfield in the Paracels, which China calls the Xisha Islands, warned the US plane to stay away from what it claimed was Chinese airspace around the islands.  A Global Times report on Sunday said the PLA handled the encounter with the US aircraft in a professional manner. But the presence of the “US spy plane that conducted a close-in reconnaissance on China at China’s doorstep” shows that Washington, not Beijing, is the “aggressor” in the region, the report said.  “The US military frequently sends aircraft and vessels to the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits for close-in reconnaissance operations and provocative transits, although China is thousands of kilometers away from the US,” it said.US general: PLA ‘preparing for something’In a related development Monday, the general in charge of the US Army in the Pacific said the PLA is on a “historical trajectory” as it continues building up its forces.   “The military arm that they have created, it’s extraordinary,” Gen. Charles Flynn said at an American Enterprise Institute event.  “They are rehearsing, they are practicing, they are experimenting, and they are preparing those forces for something,” Flynn said. “But you don’t build up that kind of arsenal to just defend and protect. You are probably building that for other purposes.”  At the same event, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said that while she does not believe a PLA amphibious invasion of Taiwan is imminent, “we have to obviously prepare … to fight and win that war.”  “I think the best way we avoid fighting that war is by showing the (People’s Republic of China) and countries in the region that we can actually win that war,” she said.

People wear masks on a street in Hong Kong on February 27, 2023.Peter Parks/AFP/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      One of the last major international cities requiring face coverings on Tuesday announced it will end its controversial Covid mask mandate nearly three years after it was enacted to prevent the spread of the virus.  Hong Kong’s mandate, enforced through fines that could reach more than $1,000, had required facial coverings in all public spaces.  The rule came into effect for public transport on July 15, 2020 and was expanded two weeks later to include indoor and outdoor areas – though the vast majority of people in the city had begun wearing masks months earlier as reports of coronavirus infections spread, leading to panic buying and shortages as early as January that year.  The mandate will be fully lifted on Wednesday, the city’s leader John Lee said at a news briefing Tuesday – 959 days since the transport rule was imposed.  “We are now returning to normalcy,” Lee said, as the Asian financial hub launches a major push to welcome back business travelers and tourists.  Hong Kong has rolled back several other major controls in recent months, most notably mandatory quarantine for all international arrivals, a move celebrated by travel-starved residents, overseas family members and struggling local businesses.

However, he added, the government still advises the wearing of masks in “high risk” settings such as elderly care homes and hospitals.  Most other places in Asia have either fully or partially eased their mask mandates in recent months, including South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

Authorities had argued the isolation period was necessary to reduce imported cases and stamp out local transmission – previously one of the benchmarks necessary to reopen the city’s border with mainland China, which had adhered to a strict zero-Covid policy until it abruptly reopened at the end of last year.

It backtracked just weeks later amid public outcry, acknowledging that people had “shied away from exercising” due to the rule.  “Face masks have played an important role in reducing community transmission in Hong Kong but now that almost everyone is vaccinated and most people have also been infected, dropping the legal mandate is well past due,” said Karen Grepin, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health.    “People can now do their own risk assessment to determine if they want to wear one or not.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Ron DeSantis’ new book, “The Courage to Be Free,” leans into the culture wars that established him as one of the early Republican favorites for the GOP nomination for the presidency.   While more sparse on biographical details than most political memoirs, the 256-page book offers some new insights into his upbringing, college years and military service. But mostly, DeSantis rehashes his contentious four years as governor and suggests he has laid a path for others to follow.   Broadside Books“The battles we have fought in Florida – from defeating the biomedical security state to stifling woke corporations to fighting indoctrination in schools – strike at the heart of what it means to be a Floridian and an American,” DeSantis writes.  The book’s release has coincided with the soft-launch of the Republican’s presidential campaign and it ends with a forward-looking note that alludes at the next challenge ahead.  “The Florida Blueprint is a simple formula: be willing to lead, have the courage of your convictions, deliver for your constituents, and reap the political rewards. This is a blueprint for America’s revival. We’ve shown it can be done,” he writes.  CNN obtained an advance copy of the book before its publication on Tuesday. Here are four takeaways:DeSantis (gently) pushes back against TrumpDeSantis largely avoids direct confrontation with former President Donald Trump, whom he praises for his “unique star power,” “massive following” and  “filling the void that GOP leaders had left by ignoring the preferences of their own voters.” He continued his defense of Trump’s 2016 campaign against investigations for Russian election interference.   But DeSantis expended considerable ink challenging Trump’s version of the 2018 Florida governor race to claim back credit for his victory.   Trump has claimed DeSantis “begged” for a gubernatorial endorsement in the Republican gubernatorial primary – shed tears even. Before Trump got involved, DeSantis was “dead” and “leaving the race,” the former president recently told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt.  DeSantis recalled asking Trump in late 2017 “if he would be willing to send out a tweet touting me as a good candidate for Florida governor.” Trump, DeSantis said, “seemed amenable, but at the same time, I was not holding my breath.”  Trump did tweet about DeSantis, calling him “a brilliant young leader” and playing up the then-congressman’s Ivy League credentials.   In DeSantis’ telling, he recognized the power of Trump’s endorsement, but suggested its appeal was limited.  “I do not think Republican primary voters are sheep who simply follow an endorsement from a politician they like without any individual analysis, but I do believe that a major endorsement can put a candidate on the radar of GOP voters in a way that boosts a good candidate’s prospects,” he writes.  DeSantis later says it was his debate performance, not Trump’s support, that led to a reversal in the polling. He omitted, though, that Trump had tweeted a more forceful “full endorsement” of DeSantis just two months before the primary. Nor did he note that Trump sent a team of Florida operatives to help DeSantis’ campaign after the primary.   Throughout the book, DeSantis finds more opportunities to undercut the former president. At several points, DeSantis bemoans the lack of activity in Trump’s first two years in office, when Republicans controlled the House and Senate. Though he doesn’t blame Trump explicitly, when juxtaposed against his own record compelling Republican lawmakers in his state to act repeatedly in service of his agenda, the implication seems clear.   “Here we had a unified Republican government for the first time in more than a decade, and yet so much of the time was frittered away on matters like the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump’s campaign had colluded with Russia, which GOP-led committees investigated for two years,” he writes. “Why Congress didn’t do more significant things, such as appropriating money to build the wall at the US-Mexico border, was beyond me.”Inside the feud with DisneyDeSantis’ book frames his battle with Disney as a demarcation line in his political story. It’s mentioned on the second page of the introduction. The juiciest excerpts from that particular chapter (which he labeled “The Magic Kingdom of Woke Corporatism”) were released in advance to Fox News. And, in a symbolic move, he signed the bill to remove Disney’s special governing powers Monday, the eve of his book’s release.   DeSantis’ views his own political feud with the company as somewhat ironic, given that he married his wife in Disney World. He also is quite clear that his wife, Casey, who hailed from “a family of Disney enthusiasts,” was the catalyst for the location of their nuptials.  “My only condition was that no Disney characters could be part of our wedding,” he wrote. “I wanted our special day to look and feel like a traditional wedding. I didn’t want Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck in our wedding photos.”  His relationship with Florida’s largest employer broke down last year as outrage intensified over a Florida bill to limit the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity. DeSantis recalled then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek told him during a phone call that he did not want to get the company involved but was under pressure to weigh in.   DeSantis urged Chapek to steer clear and suggested the blowback would pass in 48 hours once there is “some new outrage that the woke mob will focus on.”  “You will end up putting yourself in an untenable position,” he recalled telling Chapek. “People like me will say, Gee, how come Disney has never said anything about China, where they make a fortune?’”  Disney ultimately weighed in, saying in a statement that it was “dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.” And DeSantis pounced, as he said he would.  To DeSantis, the episode is a microcosm of a greater struggle between the fight conservatives expect from GOP leaders and the instincts of Republicans not to meddle in the affairs of businesses. DeSantis argues, “In this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand.”   “Unfortunately, the sad upshot of these changes is that corporate America has become a major protagonist in battles over American politics and culture. The battle lines almost invariably find large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes,” he writes. “It is unthinkable that these large companies would side with conservative Americans on issues such as the Second Amendment, the right to life, election integrity, and religious liberty.”DeSantis vs. DeSantisDeSantis’ first book, the little-read “Dreams from Our Founding Fathers” published in 2011, is a case for limited government, separation of powers, humble leadership and executive constraint. DeSantis’ latest book is a defense of his most contentious executive actions, achieved by consolidating power and flexing executive authority, in ways that suggest he has undergone an evolution of his previous principles.   In “The Courage to be Free,” DeSantis – the former star athlete and Naval officer – demonstrates a tactical precision for using his executive powers in ways intended to keep Democrats and the media off guard in pursuit of an aggressive and partisan agenda. He brought to the job, he writes, “an understanding of how a constitutional form of government operates, the various pressure points that exist, and the best way to leverage authority to achieve substantial policy victories.”  “One of my first orders of business after getting elected was to have my transition team amass an exhaustive list of all the constitutional, statutory, and customary powers of the governor. I wanted to be sure that I was using every lever available to advance our priorities,” he writes.  DeSantis, looking to jumpstart his political career in 2011, eviscerated then-President Barack Obama for what he described as executive overreach. He accused Obama’s then-health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, of using “her power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn’t like.” He wrote Obama was “resorting to using crude vulgarisms, such as the term ‘teabagger,’ to describe their fellow citizens simply because these citizens dissented from progressive orthodoxy.”  But in “The Courage to Be Free,” labeling corporations as “woke” and punishing those that speak out “is not only prudent but necessary to counteract efforts by large corporations to impose a woke agenda on the rest of us.”  As DeSantis writes: “It is regrettable that our nation has become so politicized, but the fact is that private companies wielding de facto public power is not in the best interests of most Americans.”Continuing to litigate his coronavirus responseDeSantis built his reelection for governor around his response to Covid-19 and his book makes clear he will continue to make that a part of his message as he looks toward a potential campaign for president.   As he often does, DeSantis described Florida as a “citadel of freedom in the United States,” and defended his actions to reopen schools for the 2020-2021 school year.   “When I announced Florida’s back to school policy, perhaps because I did so during the height of the summer COVID-19 wave, there was substantial public opposition to my decision,” DeSantis says. “For all the controversy that swirled around my decision, and all the incoming fire I took by making it, there was never a doubt in my mind that keeping our schools open was right for our state.”  “Keeping Florida free” from Covid-19 restrictions has earned DeSantis criticism from Democrats and health experts – a badge he proudly wears. But DeSantis also puts up his response against the rest of the country, even Trump, who he noted stood behind health officials who pushed states to shut down activity for two weeks to slow the spread.   DeSantis also shared insight into his efforts to open up Florida for sports, including a promise to UFC president Dana White to big foot any local government that prevented him from holding fights in Florida.  “I will overrule any mayor that gives you guys a hard time,” DeSantis told White.  DeSantis called for a “thorough and unbiased investigation of all aspects of the pandemic,” including the origins of the virus.   On Monday, John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said, “There is not a consensus right now, in the US government about exactly how Covid got started. There is just not an intelligence community consensus.”  Kirby added that Biden made trying to find the origins of Covid a “priority.”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Apple supplier unlikely to resume full India operations for two months after massive fire    			By Reuters  Published  8:43 AM EST, Tue February 28, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackVideo shows workers clash with police at world's largest iPhone assembly factory    01:30   - Source:CNNReuters      Most of the fire safety equipment at Apple supplier Foxlink’s facility in southern India was not functional, a government official told Reuters on Tuesday, a day after a massive blaze forced production to be halted.  The factory, which makes charging cables for iPhones, is located in the Chittoor district of India’s Andhra Pradesh state and is unlikely to resume full operations for two months, raising supply chain concerns for the U.S. tech giant, Reuters reported earlier in the day.  Foxlink was engulfed in a massive fire on Monday that led part of the building to collapse. There were no casualties.  Except for fire extinguishers, safety systems such as smoke detectors, sprinklers and fire hydrants were in faulty condition, leading to a slower response in containing the fire, said J Ramanaiah, who leads the Fire Services Department in the region.  “The smoke detector was not activated and fire alarms didn’t go off,” Ramanaiah added.  Apple and Foxlink did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The cause of the fire is still being investigated.  Foxlink operates a total of 10 assembly lines in two separate facilities at the plant in Andhra, of which four were completely destroyed, one source with knowledge of the situation said. Production at the remaining six assembly lines is expected to resume later this week.  A second source familiar with the developments said that Foxlink was a key supplier for Apple in India, and “there could be potential supply chain disruptions for iPhones made in India, or shipped from India”.  Foxlink also exports charging cables and some other equipment to countries such as China and Hong Kong, with total exports worth $32.2 million since 2022, according to figures from a private customs data provider.  Last year, the data indicates Foxlink exported around 7 million USB-C to lightening cables from India, and in January shipped 1.6 million units. Foxlink and Apple did not respond to questions about the customs data. Foxlink’s Indian sales numbers were not immediately clear.  The incident is the latest problem to hit Apple suppliers in India, from where it is increasingly ramping up manufacturing and exports. Apple has 11 suppliers in the country.  Production was hit at a facility of Apple contract manufacturer Foxconn in 2021 due to food poisoning among workers, and a Wistron India plant was affected by worker unrest in 2020 over non-payment of wages.Impact on businessReuters visited the Foxlink site on Tuesday. Part of the building was completely charred, while residual smoke was still rising from other areas.  Many workers gathered outside the facility, with some anxious about the status of their contract jobs. They told Reuters the fire broke out during lunch break on Monday, and some air conditioners exploded as fire spread.  “The fire became uncontrollable,” one worker said, declining to be named.  The regional fire department will submit a report on the incident to state authorities, which will then decide whether to form a panel to investigate the matter further or not, said Shuvana Sony, zone manager of the industrial park where the Foxlink plant is located.  A police official told Reuters on Monday there was an estimated loss of $12 million at the factory.  Cupertino, California-based Apple has bet big on India since it began assembling iPhones in the country in 2017 in line with the Indian government’s push for local manufacturing.

Video Ad FeedbackHow Biden administration's export ban is choking off China's tech ambitions    02:55   - Source:CNNCNN      Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is launching the Biden administration’s high-priority effort to out-compete China in a key sector: Semiconductor chips.   And amid tensions with China marked by the dramatic downing of a spy balloon and new warnings that Beijing is considering providing lethal aid to Russia, Raimondo’s sales pitch these days is simple: Making chips is core to US national security.“It’s no secret that we are in a global – very heated global competition with China. And technology is at the crux of that competition,” Raimondo told CNN in an interview. “Right now, we are much too reliant upon Taiwan for leading edge chips. So, a big part of our strategy around being a global leader is investing in America: In our people, in our capacity to out innovate China and the rest of the world.”   As the Commerce Department on Tuesday launches its application for billions of dollars in semiconductor subsidies, Raimondo said she wants to be “crystal clear” that the program is “a national security initiative.” But reaching those national security goals, she said, will require developing a US workforce that can meet the moment.   “We simply will not be successful in achieving the national security goals of the CHIPS initiative unless we invest in our workforce, period. Full stop,” Raimondo said. “For decades, we’ve taken our eye off the ball with manufacturing, which means the worker supply of people with the skills to do super technical manufacturing has withered. And so, we need to be honest about that, but also embrace it as an opportunity to come up with creative solutions.”   To that end, the Commerce Department is asking every company vying for a share of the $39 billion in direct funding for semiconductor manufacturing to develop and outline plans for how they plan to build a skilled and diverse workforce, including by working with high schools and community colleges.   Companies applying for the funding will need to lay out strategies and commitments for training workers and coordinating with educational and other community institutions to meet their workforce goals.   As part of Raimondo’s initiative to bring one million women into the construction industry over the next decade, applicants will also need to detail steps they will take to recruit and train a diverse construction workforce, including efforts to recruit women to the field. Raimondo said she expects building new chips manufacturing hubs will require 120,000 to 140,000 construction workers.   Applicants seeking over $150 million in funding will also need to lay out how they will provide its workforce with access to childcare, including through on-site childcare or by subsidizing the cost of childcare.  Some of these initiatives – recruiting more women and people of color into specialized fields or ensuring that high school and community college graduates can receive technical training – are ideas that the Biden administration has touted in other contexts throughout the president’s first two years in office. But one senior administration official insisted that the applications would be “seriously vetted and pressure-tested,” saying that if their workforce plans do not clear the bar, “we will not sign off on the funding.”  Raimondo, for her part, acknowledged that senior executives at chips manufacturing companies have questioned whether the US workforce is up to the task.   “They say, ‘America doesn’t manufacture anymore. America hasn’t manufactured chips in a really long time at scale, you don’t have the talent supply. How are we going to be successful?’” Raimondo said.   She also suggested to CNN that there is a unique opportunity to make real headway on these goals in the context of semiconductors – precisely because there are such serious national security imperatives at stake.   “If we don’t recruit more people, including women, into the construction trades, these projects won’t be built on time and on budget. And then we won’t as a nation hit our national security goal,” Raimondo said. “Same thing for engineers. Same thing for technicians.”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Video Ad FeedbackChina infuriated by lab leak theory while simultaneously pointing finger at US lab    04:02   - Source:CNNCNN      US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said Monday that China will have to “be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis” if the US and China are going to be able to work together.  Burns added that the Chinese surveillance balloon and Beijing’s position on the war in Ukraine are “two of the most important issues that we’re dealing with right now.”  Burns’ comments on Covid were made in reference to strengthening the World Health Organization, in response to a question about political polarization in the US and how it impacts America’s standing and ability to tackle geopolitical challenges.  Burns was speaking at a US Chamber of Commerce event the day after news emerged that the Department of Energy assessed with “low confidence” that the deadly pandemic likely originated from a lab leak. While Burns was not speaking specifically about the latest assessment, the Department of Energy’s new finding underscores how US intelligence agencies remain divided on the origins of the pandemic – in part because Beijing has not been cooperative with efforts to investigate the matter.  The latest assessment, which was an update of the intelligence community’s views on the origins of the pandemic, further added to the divide among the 18 intelligence community agencies. In 2021, a declassified intelligence community report found four agencies in the intelligence community assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild, while the FBI assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident.   A low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.

While the new assessment has resurfaced questions about the origins of the pandemic, Burns said the Chinese surveillance balloon which the US shot down and Beijing’s position on the war in Ukraine are “two of the most important issues that we’re dealing with right now.” Burns said it was “a moment where we’ve got to manage these differences, hold China to account and build up our alliance system out here in the Indo-Pacific.”  Burns noted that the US thought it “had a chance in 2023 for greater stability” coming out of the meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, noting that “a lot of that conversation was focused, frankly, on the differences between us, in our interest, both of us, in trying to manage those differences effectively so that we don’t end up in a conflict, God forbid, between our two countries.”  Those prospects were stymied when the US detected the Chinese surveillance balloon in American airspace, Burns indicated, noting that, “we’re now in this surreal moment, where the Chinese who I think you know, lost the debate over the balloon, globally lost influence and credibility around the world because of what they have done.”  JERICHO,  NEW YORK - MARCH 21: A close-up view of a swab used by medical workers tend to administer the coronavirus test at the drive-in center at ProHealth Care on March 21, 2020 in Jericho, New York.

And it’s a little bit frustrating because I think everybody knows the truth here,” Burns said.  Burns’ call for transparency on Covid-19 in the context of strengthening the WHO – a key global agency tasked with responding to pandemics – was mentioned as part of a catalog of things that Burns said “most Americans” would want Beijing and the US to work together on, including climate change and food security.  The State Department has repeatedly called for Beijing to be transparent about the origins of Covid.  “It’s in everyone’s interest, it’s – including in the interest of the PRC, that they work with the international community, lend a degree of transparency to the international investigations into COVID origins so that neither they nor we nor any country around the world should have to pay this kind of steep cost again,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in November.

While the FBI has also assessed – with moderate confidence – the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 likely leaked from a lab, the majority of the intelligence community still believes that Covid either emerged naturally in the wild, or that there is still too little evidence to make a judgment one way or another.  Three sources told CNN that the Department of Energy’s shift was based in part on information about research being conducted at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control in Wuhan, China, which was studying a coronavirus variant around the time of the outbreak.  CNN has previously reported that the Chinese CDC lab in Wuhan was researching coronaviruses and bats, but it is unclear how closely related the variants being studied there were to SARS-CoV-2, the strain of the virus which spread around the world in 2020.   Other intelligence agencies, however, have disagreed that this data point was sufficient evidence to assess that the virus may have leaked from the lab, according to the sources.  The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, as seen on February 3, 2021.Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesUS Energy Department assesses Covid-19 likely resulted from lab leak, furthering US intel divide over virus originA 2021 report issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence revealed that the National Intelligence Council, along with four other unidentified agencies, assessed with low confidence that the initial Covid-19 infection “was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus.”   Three other intelligence community agencies were “unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, with some analysts favoring natural origin, others a laboratory origin, and some seeing the hypotheses as equally likely.” One of those undecided agencies, as CNN has reported, is the CIA, which remains on the fence on the issue.   The only significant shift from the 2021 report was the Department of Energy analysis, sources said. The intelligence community provided an update to that report to lawmakers in recent weeks, which included the new DoE assessment.  Two Democratic sources familiar with the intelligence debate downplayed the significance of the new Department of Energy assessment because the other, more significant agencies in the intelligence community, which also reviewed the information the Energy Department used for its assessment, have not shifted their position.

They also reiterated that China is still withholding critical information they could share that would provide further clarity.  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs pushed back when asked about the reported assessment during a regular briefing on Monday. “The parties concerned should stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin,” spokesperson Mao Ning said.  State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Monday accused China of “blocking from the beginning international investigators and members of the global health community from accessing information that they need to understand the origins of Covid-19.”   A June 2021 US intelligence community memo that was issued as part of the investigation into the origins of Covid-19, which was previously obtained by CNN, directed agencies to expand their collection on the “breadth of Chinese biological research and related activities.”   The memo specifically instructed the intelligence community to focus on “data or samples from sites where sampling relevant to coronavirus research took place,” including the Huanan Seafood wholesale market which is located just blocks away from the Wuhan CDC.  The 2021 ODNI report noted that a definitive assessment of the pandemic’s origins will likely remain elusive until China agrees to cooperate with global investigations.

House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky and Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup, head of the Coronavirus Select Subcommittee, sent requests Monday to the State Department, Department of Energy and FBI for documents and testimony related to their ongoing probe into the pandemic and how it began, according to letters obtained by CNN.  A Republican aide said Wenstrup’s subcommittee plans to hold its first hearing on March 8.  National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby reiterated at the White House on Monday that the US government does not have a consensus on the origins of the virus.   “What the president wants is facts. He wants the whole government designed to go get those facts. And that’s what we’re doing and we’re just not there yet,” Kirby told reporters. “And when we’re there yet, and if we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress – than we’re going to do that.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Did it come from a lab? Was it a zoonotic transfer? Something else? Surely, with time, an answer would become clear.   But now, three years removed from the start of a pandemic that is still disrupting daily life, an assessment from the US Energy Department is only adding to the confusion about what really happened in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.  The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, as seen on February 3, 2021.Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesUS Energy Department assesses Covid-19 likely resulted from lab leak, furthering US intel divide over virus originThe department has assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic most likely emerged from a laboratory leak in China, according to a newly updated classified intelligence report first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.  Yet two sources said that the department assessed in the intelligence report that it had “low confidence” that the coronavirus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, CNN’s Jeremy Herb and Natasha Bertrand reported.  Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence; and a low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.  National security adviser Jake Sullivan acknowledged on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that the intelligence community is divided on the matter, while noting that President Joe Biden has put resources into getting to the bottom of the origin question.  The intelligence community has been split on the matter for years.  In 2021, the intelligence community declassified a report that showed four agencies in the intelligence community had assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild.One assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident.Three other intelligence community elements were unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, the community’s report said.    Lab leak theory gains tractionFor the better part of 2020, advocates of the lab leak theory had to fight against claims they were being xenophobic or racist — in part thanks to anti-Chinese rhetoric from then-President Donald Trump, who embraced the theory.  An inquiry launched by Trump’s State Department, which sought to investigate whether China’s biological weapons program could have had a greater role in the pandemic’s origin in Wuhan, was shut down early on in the Biden administration.  A letter from public health experts published in February 2020 in The Lancet, an influential scientific journal, also set the tone early by declaring the virus to have a natural origin.  But the lab leak theory has gained more traction with time, especially following reports that the intelligence community found evidence that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell seriously ill with a mysterious virus in November 2019 – although it’s not clear whether they contracted Covid-19 and no further evidence has emerged to corroborate that report.   By July 2021, senior Biden administration officials overseeing an intelligence review into the origins believed that the lab leak theory was at least as credible as the possibility that the virus emerged naturally in the wild – a dramatic shift from a year earlier, when Democrats publicly downplayed such an idea.‘Not a definitive answer’ The latest intelligence assessment was provided to Congress as Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pushing for further investigation into the theory, while accusing the Biden administration of playing down its possibility.  House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul said Sunday he was “pleased” the Energy Department “has finally reached the same conclusion that I had already come to.” (The Texas Republican had released a 2021 report that concluded that “the preponderance of the evidence” showed the pandemic originated with a leak from the Wuhan lab.)  “Now is the time for the entire Biden administration to join the Department of Energy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the majority of Americans by publicly concluding what common sense told us at the start – the COVID-19 pandemic originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China,” McCaul said in a statement.  Sullivan said Sunday that Biden had directed the national laboratories, which are part of the Department of Energy, to be brought into the assessment.    “Right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash.  “Some elements of the intelligence community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other. A number of them have said they just don’t have enough information to be sure.”  So where does that leave us? Not far from where we started.   Past pandemics have emerged from natural transmission through animals, and it often takes months or years to discover the host that the virus passed through as it adapted to infect humans.  In some cases, as in Ebola, the original natural source has never been identified. And it’s been more than 40 years since the first cases of Ebola.  So why does it matter where Covid-19 came from? As Relman, the Stanford microbiologist, previously noted to CNN, finding the answer can help prevent the next pandemic.

CNN exclusive: Yellen says ‘so far, so good’ in US inflation battle    			By Alicia Wallace, CNN		  Published  12:34 PM EST, Mon February 27, 2023    Link Copied!   US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Monday 27 February, 2023.CNNMinneapolisCNN      Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday she believes US inflation remains too high but that a soft landing is on the radar.  During an exclusive interview with CNN’s Melissa Bell from Kyiv, Yellen said the Federal Reserve’s efforts to date to bring down inflation while maintaining a strong labor market appear achievable.   “I would say, ‘So far, so good,’” said Yellen, a former Fed chair who led the central bank from 2014-2018.   “Obviously there are risks, and the global situation we face is very uncertain,” she said. “There can be shocks from it. But look, inflation still is too high, but generally if you look over the last year, inflation has been coming down. And I know the Fed is committed to continuing the process of bringing it down to more normal levels, and I believe they’ll be successful with it.”  Yellen was in Kyiv Monday on an unannounced visit for a series of meetings and engagements, including with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to reaffirm the United States’ support of Ukraine and to announce the recent transfer of $1.25 billion in economic and budgetary assistance.   In her interview with Bell, Yellen addressed questions on domestic matters such as inflation and the debt ceiling breach in addition to the effectiveness of sanctions against Russia’s economy.   Yellen said the “extraordinary measures” undertaken by the Treasury Department to delay breaching the debt ceiling will help pay the government’s bills until at least early June.   She said it would be “inconceivable” for the United States — “whose currency, the dollar, serves as the world’s reserve currency; a country with the deepest most liquid financial markets where Treasuries are the ultimate safe asset” and “with a credit rating the United States has always had” — to default on its obligations.  “It’s utterly essential to preserve that to avoid economic and financial catastrophe,” she told CNN.  The only solution for that issue, Yellen said, is for Congress to “meet its responsibility” as it has done in recent history to raise the debt ceiling to pay for spending already authorized.  “Congress has to stand up and say they’re committed to having the government pay the bills that are due,” she said.  Addressing the Russian economy, which has not buckled under an array of sanctions from the United States and other Western countries, Yellen said she expects it to grow weaker as the country loses foreign investment and runs through its reserves and rainy-day funds.  “We will see an increasing toll on Russia’s economic trajectory over time,” she said. “And their ability to replenish the military equipment that’s been destroyed in their attacks on Ukraine, that’s been very greatly jeopardized.”  Still, recent US intelligence has shown that China is considering increasing its support of the Russian economy and war efforts, including supplying drones and ammunition. Such a move would bring “severe” consequences, Yellen said.   “We have been extremely clear that we will not tolerate systematic violations by any country of the sanctions that we have put in place that are intended to deprive Russia of access to military equipment to wage this war,” she said. “And we have been very clear with the Chinese government and have made clear to Chinese firms and financial institutions that the consequences of violating those sanctions would be very severe.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Nathan Frandino/Reuters    These companies held money at Silicon Valley Bank and aren’t sure if they’ll recover the funds    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.   (You can get “CNN’s 5 Things” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. Winter stormA barrage of snow, rain and harsh winds is forecast from the West Coast to the Great Lakes today, following a similar string of severe weather last week. Approximately 284,000 homes and businesses were without power across the US as of this morning, about half of which were in Michigan, where the region is bracing for another round of ice and snow, forecasts show. More than 100 other storm reports were recorded in parts of the Central US as hurricane-force winds and thunderstorms tore through various states overnight. A gust of 114 mph was recorded in Texas – equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. Meanwhile, the West is expecting a separate system of rain and high-elevation snow that will push from the Pacific Northwest down into California, where some rare blizzard warnings remain in effect. 2. Covid-19The US Department of Energy has assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic most likely came from a laboratory leak in China. The new assessment further adds to the divide in the US government over whether the pandemic began in China in 2019 as the result of a lab leak or whether it emerged naturally. Various intelligence agencies have been split on the matter. “Right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN on Sunday, noting that President Joe Biden has put resources into getting to the bottom of the origin question. The US began exploring the possibility that Covid-19 spread in a lab as early as April 2020, though intelligence officials have said a lack of cooperation from Beijing has made it difficult to attain answers.

Student loansPresident Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan goes before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Millions of student loan borrowers could see up to $20,000 of their debt canceled depending on the outcome of the hearing. It’s unclear exactly when the Supreme Court will issue its decision, but typically the justices release their rulings by the end of the current term, around late June or early July. The ruling will also determine when payments on federal student loans will resume after a pandemic-related pause that has been in place for nearly three years. The justices are expected to hear arguments in two cases Tuesday concerning the program, which is estimated to cost $400 billion. 4. TurkeyNearly 200 people have been arrested for alleged poor building construction following the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey earlier this month, Turkey’s Justice Ministry said. According to officials in the region, more than 5,700 buildings in Turkey collapsed in the magnitude 7.8 quake, which killed about 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The widespread destruction came after building codes were tightened in the wake of previous disasters – which should have ensured that modern builds would withstand large tremors. However, many buildings that were damaged or collapsed appeared to have been newly constructed. Residents and experts are now questioning if the government failed to take the necessary steps to enforce building regulations.

SpaceXSpaceX and NASA called off an astronaut launch to the International Space Station this morning with about two minutes left on the countdown clock. Engineers put the mission on hold at 1:45 a.m. ET after an issue was detected with the rocket’s ignition fluid. Once the problem is resolved, the rocket will launch two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut, and an astronaut from the United Arab Emirates to the ISS, where they will spend up to six months carrying out science experiments and maintaining the two-decade-old space station. NASA said it will aim to launch on Thursday, “pending resolution of the technical issue preventing Monday’s launch.”THIS JUST INEx-husband and relatives charged with murder of Hong Kong modelFour members of the same family have been charged in connection with the gruesome killing of Hong Kong model Abby Choi after police said they found what are believed to be parts of her dismembered body.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesWashingtonCNN      Chinese hackers are too frequently going “unidentified and undeterred,” and software companies aren’t doing enough to secure their products from cyber-attacks that “can do real damage” to US interests through the loss of trade secrets, a top US cyber official said Monday.  “The risk introduced to all of us by unsafe technology is frankly much more dangerous and pervasive than the spy balloon, but somehow we’ve allowed ourselves to accept it,” US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a speech at Carnegie Mellon University.   Easterly was referring to a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that flew over multiple US states before the US military shot it down on February 4. The episode has increased tensions in US-China relations and caused US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to postpone a trip to Beijing.   Easterly’s speech reflects frustration from US officials that major software programs used by millions of people are routinely released with gaping flaws that can be exploited by hackers. After a series of high-profile hacks, the Biden administration introduced cybersecurity regulations for sectors such as pipelines. US officials have not ruled out more regulation in an effort to raise defenses.   While the balloon caused a public uproar, cybersecurity officials from across the US government have been warning for years that China has been quietly amassing US government and corporate secrets through hacking. Beijing denies the allegations.  The alleged Chinese cyber espionage campaigns have often exploited wildly popular software that has allowed them a foothold into US government agencies and corporations alike. In late 2021, for example, suspected hackers used a popular password management software to breach multiple US defense contractors, according to researchers.   Easterly, who spent years working on offensive cyber operations with the US National Security Agency, said the frequent hacks of US organizations by China and other foreign governments and criminal groups are merely a “symptom” rather than a cause of US insecurity in cyberspace.   The bigger problem, she said, is that too many major software makers are not designing their products mores securely and making it easy on the user to maintain that security.   Easterly did not single out specific companies for poor software design, but instead cited statistics from Twitter and Microsoft saying just a fraction of users or enterprise customers are using an extra layer of security when signing into their accounts.   “[T]he burden of safety should never fall solely upon the customer,” Easterly said. “Technology manufacturers must take ownership of the security outcomes of their customers.”  She called on technology manufacturers to “embrace radical transparency” by sharing more of their software design plans publicly so they can be scrutinized by experts.

Tom Sizemore, seen here in 2014 in Park City, Utah.Victoria Will/Invision/APCNN      The family of actor Tom Sizemore is currently “deciding end of life matters” following an update from doctors, according to a statement CNN received Monday evening from Sizemore’s manager Charles Lago.  “Today, doctors informed his family that there is no further hope and have recommended end of life decision. The family is now deciding end of life matters and a further statement will be issued on Wednesday,” the statement said.   “We are asking for privacy for his family during this difficult time and they wish to thank everyone for the hundreds of messages of support, and prayers that have been received. This has been a difficult time for them.”  Earlier this month, Sizemore, 61, was hospitalized in intensive care after suffering a brain aneurysm.  “Since that day, Tom has remained in critical condition, in a coma and in intensive care,” the statement from Lago noted.   The Detroit-born Sizemore had an early, small role in the Oliver Stone 1989 film “Born on the Fourth of July,” and had his break in television playing Sgt. Vinnie Ventresca around the same time, in the ABC series “China Beach.”  He appeared in a number of hit crime and war movies in the 90s and 2000s, including “Heat,” “Natural Born Killers,” “Pearl Harbor” and “Black Hawk Down.”  He is perhaps best known for playing Sgt. Mike Horvath in the World War II movie “Saving Private Ryan.”  Other notable roles for Sizemore came in the titles “The Relic,” “True Romance” and “Bringing Out the Dead,” the latter costarring Nicolas Cage and directed by Martin Scorsese.  The actor nabbed a Golden Globe nomination in 2000 for best performance by an actor in a miniseries or motion picture made for television for his role in “Witness Protection.”   More recently, he appeared in episodes of the hit series “Twin Peaks” and “Cobra Kai.”  Sizemore has long struggled with drug addiction, and had a string of legal issues over the course of his career.  He was convicted in 2003 on domestic violence charges related to his relationship with Heidi Fleiss. He told CNN’s Larry King in a 2010 interview he had been addicted to cocaine, heroin and meth, and he participated in the 2010 season of the reality show “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.”    CNN’s Hannah Sarisohn, Kevin Flower and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.CNN      An updated intelligence assessment about the origins of the Covid-19 virus has reopened the long-simmering and unsolved debate about how the virus came to be – and will fuel a new committee House Republicans have created to investigate the issue.  While scientists still predominantly believe the virus occurred naturally in animals and spread to humans in an outbreak at a market in Wuhan, China, the US Department of Energy’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence is now the second tentacle of the US government intelligence apparatus, along with the FBI, that endorses the “lab leak theory” – the minority view that the virus occurred as a result of work in a Chinese lab.  The DOE office is one of 18 government agencies that make up the intelligence community, which are under the umbrella of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Most of the intelligence community remains either split or leaning toward the natural occurrence theory that scientific investigations have concluded as most likely. But without conclusive evidence, no one has been able to reject the lab leak theory entirely.  Video Ad FeedbackBiden's national security adviser responds to new report on Covid-19's origin    01:19   - Source:CNNThe theory has been the subject of much focus by Republican lawmakers, and polling in 2021 suggested a majority of Americans believe the Chinese government had something to do with the origins of the virus. Asked whether they believe the virus originated from a laboratory leak in China or from human contact with an infected animal, about half (52%) said that they believed a lab leak was responsible.  Now in the House majority, Republicans have formed a special subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee specifically to investigate, among other things, China’s role in the early spread of the virus and US government dollars that helped fund some research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the research facility at the center of the lab leak theory.  Lack of answers about the origins of Covid-19 and an accumulation of circumstantial evidence have led some scientists, the Biden administration and the World Health Organization to argue that the lab leak theory needs more study. If only China was cooperating.  US lawmakers who have pushed the lab leak theory seized on reporting about the new Department of Energy assessment, although the details of what led to the assessment are not yet public.  “I’m pleased the Department of Energy has finally reached the same conclusion that I had already come to,” Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.  Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri demanded more information about the Department of Energy’s assessment and promised to push for more such reports to be declassified.Still a minority view The change in opinion by the Energy Department’s intelligence office is far from a total backing of the “lab leak” theory.  For starters, the conclusion was reached only with “low confidence,” as opposed to medium or high confidence.  CNN’s Jeremy Herb and Natasha Bertrand explain the confidence levels:  Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.It’s not clear what exactly changed things for the officials involved in the assessment for the Department of Energy, but whatever it was has not convinced the majority of intelligence agencies.  According to a two-page list of takeaways from the initial 2021 intelligence community review of Covid-19 origins ordered by President Joe Biden, four components of the intelligence community and the National Intelligence Council believed, like most scientists, that “natural exposure” caused the virus.  Three elements of the intelligence community did not believe there was enough evidence to make a determination. And one agency, which CNN has reported is the FBI, had medium confidence in the lab leak theory.There is agreement on some key pointsWhile the intelligence community remains very much split on what led to the virus, they were completely aligned on three key points when they first issued a two-page unclassified report in 2021:  The virus was not developed as a biological weapon.Most of the agencies believe the virus was not genetically engineered. (Two agencies did not think there was sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way.)Chinese officials did not have “foreknowledge of the virus” before the initial outbreak.Something everyone seems to agree on is that China has not been cooperative in figuring out how the virus evolved.Previous investigations have not answered the questionCNN’s chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta did a long-form report in 2021 about all of the available evidence and talked to multiple people who had assessed the available evidence. A. Chris Gajilan has an extensive report on what is to be learned from all of that, and how a key WHO assessment was flawed due to a lack of cooperation from the Chinese government.  Dr. Anthony Fauci – the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases whom Republicans have told they will call before Congress to testify about the origins of the disease – has consistently repeated he believes the virus most likely occurred naturally, since other, similar viruses have evolved that way.   But he has been careful to add that it’s important to keep an “open mind” about the lab leak possibility.  An open and high-level commission could helpWhile there are multiple theories about how it happened, there is also a realization that we may never know.  “Unfortunately, I don’t think that we will ever get a real answer,” CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said Monday morning.  He argued the US government should get ahead of politically divisive theories and empanel a bipartisan group to write a definitive and public report.  “We have never had a Covid commission like the 9/11 Commission,” he said. “I think we desperately need it. Because more Americans have died of Covid than have died in every American war since the American Revolution, which is an astonishing number; that is a major national security issue.”China should ‘be more honest’The State Department renewed its criticism of China’s openness about the origins of the virus on Monday.  “If we’re going to do something to strengthen the World Health Organization, then we’re going to have to push China to be more active in it, and to of course, be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis,” US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns told reporters.  State Department spokesman Ned Price, in separate comments to reporters, accused China of “blocking from the beginning international investigators and members of the global health community from accessing information that they need to understand the origins of Covid-19.”‘Regardless, we know the next step’CNN’s John King asked Dr. Megan Ranney, deputy dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, why it matters, at this point, where the virus came from.  Ranney argued that if the virus came from a lab leak, it means the world needs better biosecurity protocols.   If the virus came from animal-to-human transmission, we need to be able to respond more quickly to outbreaks.  “Regardless, we know the next step,” Ranney said. “While we’re focusing on where Covid-19 started, we’re not spending time about how to keep America from ever having to go through the last three years again.” ‘The evidence isn’t there’King also talked to Beth Sanner, the former deputy director of national intelligence for mission integration during the Trump administration, about the report.  “If you want to blame somebody in terms of how this all unfolded, it’s very clear that China hid this, did not move quickly enough, and now is blocking investigation,” she said.  But she said it’s important to look at the entire analysis of the intelligence community, which is based on evidence. And the evidence does not conclusively point to any one theory.  “We don’t just take information or just take a feeling and turn it into analysis,” she said. “We’re actually doing a rigorous process and that’s why we don’t know yet. The evidence isn’t there.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

But China, which has declared “no limits” to its friendship with its northern neighbor, has thrown the Kremlin an economic lifeline, tempering the impact of its banishment from the global financial system.   Underscoring the closeness of the relationship, China’s top diplomat Wang Yi met President Vladimir Putin during a visit to Moscow on Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin could hold a summit in Moscow in April or early May.   Here are three ways in which China, the world’s biggest buyer of commodities and a financial and technological powerhouse, has been propping up the Russian economy:  US President Joe Biden delivers a speech at the Royal Warsaw Castle Gardens in Warsaw on February 21, 2023.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesThere are many reasons why China may not be in a hurry to see Russia's war in Ukraine end    1. Buying its energyWestern sanctions against Moscow include an embargo on oil sales and a price cap on its crude, denial of access to SWIFT — the international messaging system that enables bank transactions — and the freezing of central bank assets held overseas.  These moves were aimed at weakening Russia’s ability to finance the war.   They’ve had an impact. Russia’s economy slid into recession in 2022, shrinking by 4.5%, according to the most recent estimate by the World Bank.  But Moscow’s fiscal revenues increased, according to the Russian government. That’s mainly thanks to high energy prices and Russia’s efforts to reroute exports to other willing buyers, such as China and India.  China has been buying more energy from Russia since the Ukraine war started. VCG/VCG/Getty Images/File“China has supported Russia’s war economically in the sense that it has ramped up trade with Russia, which has weakened Western efforts to cripple Moscow’s military machine,” said Neil Thomas, senior analyst for China and Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group.  “Xi Jinping wants to deepen China’s relationship with an increasingly isolated Russia,” he said, adding that Moscow’s “pariah status” enables Beijing to exert more leverage on it to obtain cheap energy, advanced military technology and diplomatic support for China’s international interests.

In particular, the energy trade has risen markedly since the onset of the war.  China bought $50.6 billion worth of crude oil from Russia from March to December, up 45% from the same period the previous year. Coal imports surged 54% to $10 billion. Natural gas purchases including pipeline gas and LNG, skyrocketed 155% to $9.6 billion.  It’s a boon for both sides. For Russia, it desperately needs new customers as its fossil fuels are shunned by the West. For China, now focused on getting its economy out of a slump, is in need of cheap energy to power its huge manufacturing industry.

Moscow needs new customers“For Russia, this partnership is born of desperation,” said Keith Krach, former US Under Secretary of State for Economic growth, Energy and the Environment. “He [Putin] is looking for help wherever he can find it and Xi Jinping is all too willing to prey on Putin’s desperation.”  “As for China, its eagerness to boost Russia is the latest in a series of moves that reveal yet again that Beijing is an irresponsible actor,” Krach told CNN.  The two sides are planning to expand that partnership further, including a deal between Gazprom    (GZPFY) and the China National Petroleum Corporation to supply more gas to China over the next 25 years.  “With China’s economy opening up in 2023, we can expect a further increase in Russian exports to China, including petroleum and other oil refined products,” said Anna Kireeva, an associate professor at Moscow State Institute of International Relations.2.

Russia also needs to find substitutes for its imports from Western markets, such as cars and electronics.  “And here China with its industrial capacity cannot be rivaled by any other major producer,” Kireeva said.  Chinese car brands, including Havel, Chery, and Geely, have seen their market share surge from 10% to 38% in a year following the exit of Western brands, according to the most recent data from Russian research firm Autostat. And that share is likely to grow further this year, it has forecast.  In consumer electronics, Chinese brands accounted for about 40% of the smartphone market at the end of 2021. A year later, they’ve virtually taken over the industry with 95% market share, according to market research firm Counterpoint.

Providing an alternative to the US dollar After some Russian banks were cut off from SWIFT, Moscow has been dropping the dollar for the Chinese yuan.   Russian companies have been using more yuan to facilitate the increased trade with China. Russian banks have also conducted more transactions in yuan to protect them from sanction risks, according to Kireeva.   The yuan’s share of the Russian foreign currency market jumped to 48% by November 2022 from less than 1% in January, according to Russian media, citing the head of the Moscow Exchange.  Russia briefly became the world’s third largest offshore trading hub for the yuan last July, behind Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, according to figures released by SWIFT. Since then, it has remained one of the top six markets for trading yuan — it wasn’t even in the top 15 before the Ukraine war.  Russia’s financial ministry has also doubled the share of yuan reserves the country’s sovereign wealth fund can hold to 60%, after a big chunk of its savings were frozen by international sanctions, according to Reuters.   A staff member walks past pipelines in the gas-distributing and compressing station of the China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline in the city of Heihe, the first stop after the Russia-supplied natural gas enters China, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Nov. 19, 2019. The China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline was put into operation on Monday. The pipeline is scheduled to provide China with 5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas in 2020 and the amount is expected to increase to 38 billion cubic meters annually from 2024, under a 30-year contract worth 400 billion U.S. dollars signed between the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and Russian gas giant Gazprom in May 2014. The cross-border gas pipeline has a 3,000-km section in Russia and a 5,111-km stretch in China. Wang Jianwei/Xinhua/Getty ImagesRussia says China will start paying for gas in rubles and yuanFinance Minister Anton Siluanov has said that Russia would only buy yuan in 2023 to refill the country’s sovereign wealth fund, Tass reported.   “Of all foreign currencies that the Russian [central] bank had its reserves in, it is only Chinese yuan that was not frozen and remains a ‘friendly’ one,” said Kireeva.   “We are likely to see further de-dollarization of Russia’s foreign trade in general and [an] increasing share of trade in national currencies with all states that are friendly or neutral to Moscow.”  With more yuan reserves, Moscow is able to use the Chinese currency to stabilize the ruble and its financial markets. The ruble has plunged by more than 40% against the euro and the dollar in the past year, and the main Russian stock index has fallen by more than a third.  Last month, Russia’s financial ministry announced it would resume foreign exchange interventions by selling yuan and buying rubles.

And Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds, whether it provides military assistance. But, if it goes down that road, it will come at real costs to China. And I think China’s leaders are weighing that as they make their decisions,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”  In diplomatic conversations with China, he added, the US is “not just making direct threats. We’re just laying out both the stakes and the consequences, how things would unfold. And we are doing that clearly and specifically behind closed doors.”  The flags of Russia and China flutter on the roof of a hotel with the flags of other countries removed, in central St. Petersburg, Russia, Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky)Dmitri Lovetsky/APIntelligence suggests China is considering sending drones and ammunition to Russia, sources familiar saySullivan’s comments come at a critical juncture in the war in Ukraine. The US has intelligence that the Chinese government is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition for use in the war, three sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN.  It does not appear that Beijing has made a final decision yet, the sources said, as negotiations between Russia and China about the price and scope of the equipment are ongoing.  Since invading Ukraine, Russia has repeatedly requested drones and ammunition from China, the sources familiar with the intelligence said, and Chinese leadership has been actively debating over the last several months whether or not to send the lethal aid, the sources added.  “I can level with the American people in saying that war is unpredictable,” Sullivan said Sunday when asked if the US could continue supporting Ukraine at current levels a year from now. “One year ago, we were all bracing for the fall of Kyiv in a matter – in a matter of days. One year later, Joe Biden was standing with President Zelensky in Kyiv declaring that Kyiv stands.”  “So, I cannot predict the future, and nor can anyone else. And anyone who is suggesting they can define for you how and when this war will end is not leveling with the American people or anyone else,” he said.

Ukrainian Presidential Press Service via ReutersZelensky urges top GOP lawmakers to consider new weapons wish list  Sullivan also reiterated Biden’s Friday remarks that the administration was ruling out providing F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine “for now.”   “This phase of the war requires tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, artillery, tactical air defense systems, so that Ukrainian fighters can retake territory that Russia currently occupies,” Sullivan said. “F-16s are a question for a later time.”  House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul said Sunday that Congress “can certainly write into our appropriations bills, prioritizing weapons systems” for Ukraine.   “We intend to do that,” the Texas Republican said on ABC when asked what Congress could do to push the Biden administration to provide longer-range missile systems, such as ATACMS, or F-16s to Ukraine.   “I know the administration says, ‘As long as it takes.’ I think with the right weapons, it shouldn’t take so long,” McCaul said. “This whole thing is taking too long. And it really didn’t have to happen this way.”  Sunday also marked the nine-year anniversary of Russia’s occupation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. The US State Department on Sunday reasserted that “Crimea is Ukraine.”  “The United States does not and never will recognize Russia’s purported annexation of the peninsula,” department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement, calling Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea “a clear violation of international law and of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”  Sullivan, however, would not say whether the Biden administration would support Ukraine deciding that victory would mean retaking Crimea.   “What ultimately happens with Crimea, in the context of this war and a settlement of this war, is something for the Ukrainians to determine with the support of the United States,” he said to Bash.

Two sources said that the Department of Energy assessed in the intelligence report that it had “low confidence” the Covid-19 virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan.   Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion.   The latest assessment further adds to the divide in the US government over whether the Covid-19 pandemic began in China in 2019 as the result of a lab leak or whether it emerged naturally. The various intelligence agencies have been split on the matter for years. In 2021, the intelligence community declassified a report that showed four agencies in the intelligence community had assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild, while one assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on the new assessment from the Department of Energy. A senior US intelligence official told the Journal that the update to the intelligence assessment was conducted in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and in consultation with experts outside government.   A Department of Energy spokesperson told CNN in a statement: “The Department of Energy continues to support the thorough, careful, and objective work of our intelligence professionals in investigating the origins of COVID-19, as the President directed.”  The Department of Energy’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence is one of 18 government agencies that make up the intelligence community, which are under the umbrella of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.   The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs pushed back against the claim when asked about the reported assessment during a regular briefing on Monday.  Spokesperson Mao Ning pointed to the “authoritative and scientific” conclusion reached after a 2021 field mission between Chinese and World Health Organization experts, who determined the lab leak hypothesis was “highly unlikely.” That mission was later criticized for a lack of transparency by Western governments.  “The parties concerned should stop stirring up arguments about laboratory leaks, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin,” Mao said.‘Not a definitive answer’National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that the intelligence community remains divided on the matter, while noting that President Joe Biden has put resources into getting to the bottom of the origin question.  Jake Sullivan.Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesUS says China will face 'real costs' if it provides lethal aid to Russia for war in Ukraine“Right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash. “Some elements of the intelligence community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other. A number of them have said they just don’t have enough information to be sure.”  Sullivan said Biden had directed the national laboratories, which are part of the Department of Energy, to be brought into the assessment.  In May 2020, researchers at the government-backed Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory issued a classified report that found it was possible that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, which came at a time when that line of inquiry was considered taboo.  The US began exploring the possibility that Covid-19 spread in a laboratory as early as April 2020, though the intelligence community has noted repeatedly that a lack of cooperation from Beijing has made it difficult to get to the bottom of the question.Republicans reactThe latest intelligence assessment was provided to Congress as Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pushing for further investigation into the lab leak theory, while accusing the Biden administration of playing down its possibility.   House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul said Sunday he was “pleased” that the Department of Energy “has finally reached the same conclusion that I had already come to.”  “I have requested a full and thorough briefing from the administration on this report and the evidence behind it,” the Texas Republican said in a statement.  Ranking Member Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) speaks as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken testifies before the House Committee On Foreign Affairs March 10, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Blinken is expected to take questions about the Biden administration's priorities for U.S. foreign policy.Ting Shen/Pool/Getty ImagesTop Republican on House Foreign Affairs Committee calls Covid-19 origin 'worst cover-up in human history'McCaul in his statement referred to a 2021 report he had released as ranking member of the Foreign Affairs panel, which “found a preponderance of the evidence proved” that the pandemic originated with a leak from the Wuhan lab.  The chairman called on the Biden administration to publicly concur with that conclusion.   “It is critical the administration also begin to work immediately with our partners and allies around the world to both hold the (Chinese Communist Party) accountable and to put in place updated international regulations to ensure something like this cannot happen again,” McCaul said.  Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska on Sunday called for public hearings following the disclosure of the Department of Energy assessment.   “We need to do extensive hearings. I hope our Democratic colleagues in the Congress can support that. I know the Republicans in the House are certainly supportive of that,” the Senate Armed Services Committee member said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  “Think about what just happened over the last three years, one of the biggest pandemics in a century. A lot of evidence that it’s coming from the Chinese,” Sullivan said.  A spokesperson for House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement that the committee was “reviewing the classified information provided” by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to a letter requesting information earlier this month.

Real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang disappeared for several months after he allegedly spoke out against Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2020. He was then jailed for 18 years.   Anbang chairman Wu Xiaohui was reportedly detained by authorities as part of a government investigation. He too was eventually jailed for 18 years.  The company, an investment bank and private equity firm based in Beijing, added it is monitoring the situation and will release further statements “when appropriate.”One of China’s top investment bankersBao is known as a veteran deal maker in China’s tech industry. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping. Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.  Bao started his investment banking career in the late 1990s at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse and later went on to serve as an adviser to the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.  His team has also invested in US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio    (NIO) and Li Auto, and helped Chinese internet giants Baidu    (BIDU) and JD.com    (JD) complete their secondary listings in Hong Kong.

China approved equivalent of two new coal plants a week in 2022, report finds    			By Jessie Yeung, CNN		  Published  2:57 AM EST, Mon February 27, 2023    Link Copied!   A bulldozer pushes coal onto a conveyor belt at the Jiangyou Power Station on January 28, 2022 in China's Sichuan province. Liu Zhongjun/China News Service/Getty Imsges/FileHong KongCNN      China is surging ahead with coal, a new report shows, rapidly approving and building new power plants despite its own promises to cut back on carbon as the world plunges ever deeper into the climate crisis.  Last year, the country approved the highest number of new coal-fired power plants since 2015, according to the report, released Monday by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and the Global Energy Monitor (GEM).  “China continues to be the glaring exception to the ongoing global decline in coal plant development,” said Flora Champenois, a research analyst at GEM.  “The speed at which projects progressed through permitting to construction in 2022 was extraordinary, with many projects sprouting up, gaining permits, obtaining financing and breaking ground apparently in a matter of months,” she added.  China’s emissions are more than double those of the United States, and though the country’s leaders have previously vowed to cut back on carbon, its reliance on coal poses a significant challenge.

Getty Images/Getty ImagesChina turns back to coal as record heatwave causes power shortagesThroughout 2022, China granted permits for 106 gigawatts of capacity across 82 sites, quadruple the capacity approved in 2021 and equal to starting two large coal power plants each week, said the report.  Last year, China experienced its worst heat wave and drought in six decades, dealing a blow to hydropower-reliant provinces -— and prompting authorities to turn toward coal instead.  To ease the power crunch, coal plants boosted their output, with daily thermal coal consumption hitting a record high in August.   2021 wasn’t much better. Though Beijing had initially shut down hundreds of coal mines and pushed the remaining ones to curtail production, nationwide power shortages led the government to order mines to “produce as much coal as possible.”That push doesn’t appear to be ending anytime soon, with the report authors warning that even China’s simultaneous expansion in renewable energy won’t be enough to offset the impact.  China added a record 125 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity last year, making up 2% of the country’s electricity demand. And though that target is even higher this year, “even this increase won’t be sufficient to supply all of the demand growth without increasing power generation from fossil fuels,” said the report.

Huang Shipeng/VCG/Getty ImagesChina mined a record amount of coal in 2021. It might produce even more this yearIt added that for China to truly cut down on carbon emissions, it needs to start phasing out its “vast coal power plant fleet” rather than continue growing it. Besides the plants’ environmental impact, their “politically influential owners … have an interest in protecting their assets,” said the report.Carbon neutral goalChina and the United States are the world’s two biggest carbon emitters, with China’s emissions tripling over the past three decades, one report found in 2021.And though Chinese leader Xi Jinping had declared in 2020 that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060, activists and experts have said the government isn’t taking swift or decisive enough action.   For instance, though China released a new plan in 2021 to cut its reliance on fossil fuels, it did not announce an updated emissions target.  Later that year, the emission-cutting plan it submitted to the United Nations drew disappointment from other world leaders who had hoped for significantly higher pledges and an accelerated decarbonization timeline.  Xi himself softened his tone toward zero-carbon in the face of power outages, factory closures and compromised supply chains, saying early last year that “carbon peak and carbon neutrality cannot be realized overnight.”  The country’s climate efforts have also been hampered by geopolitics, with China suspending climate talks with the United States last year in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan — dismaying activists, who say the two countries’ cooperation is crucial if the world is to avert climate catastrophe.  Negotiations restarted months later at the UN’s COP27 summit in Egypt.

Larry Summers: Why sanctions on Russia aren’t effective    			By Ramishah Maruf, CNN		  Updated  1:55 PM EST, Sun February 26, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackUkraine's energy challenges    05:22   - Source:CNNNew YorkCNN      Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said price caps on Russian energy should be stiffened up to maximize the impact of sanctions on the country as the war in Ukraine hits a year.  The former Harvard University president said on Fareed Zakaria GPS Sunday, economic sanctions on Russia haven’t bitten hard because a countries making up a significant part of the world’s GDP, like China, India and Turkey, haven’t participated.

VCG/VCG/Getty Images/FileChina is helping to prop up the Russian economy. Here's howRussia’s economy is set to grow by 0.3% this year, the IMF reported, better than the UK or Germany, despite the sanctions and frozen central bank reserves.  Trade with Russia’s neighbors “has ramped up considerably in the last year, which suggests that they’re serving as a way station for goods to get into Russia,” Summers said.   Summers said the conflict has now become a “war of attrition,” meaning a military strategy where one side attempts to wear down the other to the point of fatigue. The way to win the economic aspect of this, Summers said, is to support Ukraine’s economy, which has left bombed cities and millions destitute.  Russian assets should be the ultimate source to pay the bill to rebuild Ukraine, Summers said.  A man walks past commercial premises put up for rent and sale in Moscow on February 10, 2023. - Real estate analysts say the housing market in Russia has been on a rollercoaster ride since Russians panicked when sanctions over the country's military action in Ukraine hit and then adjusted to their new reality. First, prices spiked as home-owners sought to secure their savings when the penalties hit. Then they dropped as tens of thousands Russians opposed to the conflict and worried for their futures up and left. President Putin insists Russia is weathering the Western sanctions. A home-grown brand has replaced McDonald's and supermarkets are offering Russian-made drinks to replace foreign brands like Coca Cola, which left Russia last year. Still, Russia's economy is facing mounting problems as the West -- one year into the conflict -- is building on its sanctions program with a 10th EU package looming. Hundreds of foreign companies have exited, leaving behind emptying shopping malls, while inflation, which stands at around 12 percent, has undermined the purchasing power of Russian wages. Natalia Koleniskova/AFP/Getty ImagesRussia's economy is hurting despite Putin's blusterIn addition to Ukraine, Russian assets should be used to support “the developing world that have paid and suffered enormously from higher food and energy prices because of Russian aggression,” Summers asserted.  It could set a “healthy precedent” for countries engaged in cross-border aggression like Russia to lose state assets, Summers added.

Dmitri Lovetsky/APWashingtonCNN      The US has intelligence that the Chinese government is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine, three sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN.   It does not appear that Beijing has made a final decision yet, the sources said, but negotiations between Russia and China about the price and scope of the equipment are ongoing.    Since invading Ukraine, Russia has repeatedly requested drones and ammunition from China, the sources familiar with the intelligence said, and Chinese leadership has been actively debating over the last several months whether or not to send the lethal aid, the sources added.  US intelligence officials have collected information in recent weeks, however, that suggests China is now leaning towards providing the equipment. The US and its allies last week began publicly warning about China’s potential military support to Russia in an effort to deter Beijing from moving ahead with it and crossing a point of no return in terms of being seen as a pariah on the world stage, US officials said.

REUTERS/Gleb GaranichGleb Garanich/ReutersKyiv marks one year of war with anxiety and a rallying cry from ZelenskyUS officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting the recent shift in China’s posture, but senior officials have been concerned enough that they have been actively sharing the intelligence with allies and partners over the last week.   The National Security Council and State Department declined to comment and CNN has asked the Chinese and Russian embassies in Washington for comment.  Asked on Friday about the potential sale of lethal equipment to Russia, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a daily briefing that “China has always taken a prudent and responsible approach to military exports and does not provide any arms sales to conflict areas or belligerents.”  The provision of drones and ammunition – which would likely be for small arms like handheld weaponry rather than larger artillery, the sources said – would mark a significant escalation of China’s support for Russia, which to date has been largely limited to Chinese companies providing non-lethal equipment like helmets, flak jackets, and satellite imagery to Russian forces.  It would also provide a potentially significant boost to Russian capabilities at a critical moment. Russian fighters are running so low on ammunition that Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, on Wednesday published photos of several dozen dead Wagner fighters and publicly blamed their deaths on the Russian Ministry of Defense’s inability to supply them with enough ammunition.

Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesBlinken tells UN Russia's crimes can't become the 'new normal' on Ukraine war anniversaryThe German publication Der Spiegel first reported that China may provide attack drones to Russia.   “The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on last weekend.   Blinken’s Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, responded to the US’ allegations earlier this week, saying that China’s position on Ukraine “can be simply put as promoting peace talks.”  “China will continue to firmly stand on the side of dialogue and peace and play a constructive part in easing the situation,” he said. China also proposed a “peace plan” for the Ukraine war on Friday that US officials remain highly skeptical of.  Russia has purchased hundreds of weapons-capable drones from Iran in recent months but is burning through them quickly with repeated attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and civilian areas.   To date, Beijing has been hesitant about providing lethal equipment that might be traced back to China because of the risk of international blowback, and Beijing still wants the provision of any equipment to Russia to be deniable and ideally non-attributable, the sources said.

Cao Yang/Xinhua/Getty Images/FILEChina calls for Russia-Ukraine ceasefire as claims to neutrality questionedThat is why much of the non-lethal support that has gone to Russia’s military to date has been small and done through Chinese companies. As CNN previously reported, the Biden administration has confronted Beijing directly about that military assistance to ascertain how complicit the central government has been.   But the lines between public and private entities in China are negligible, the sources said, and US intelligence suggests that Beijing has been using the companies for plausible deniability.   The US has also begun seeing “disturbing trend lines” in China’s support for the Russian military, officials said.   Wang visited Russia this week and Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in the coming months.     CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.  CNN      It’s no secret that sleep is important to your overall health, but a lack of sleep could have substantial effects on your heart, a new study shows. The researchers said people with insomnia are more likely to have a heart attack.  Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in the US, the researchers wrote in their report, noting that 10% to 15% of people in the US struggle with it.  ShutterstockSleep deprivation affects nearly half of American adults, study finds The meta-analysis of previously published research, published Friday in the journal Clinical Cardiology, suggests that the potential association between insomnia and heart attack risk is strongest in women.  Dr. Martha Gulati, director of prevention at the Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute, said that most of her patients are women and that insomnia is a noted risk factor for women who have had any form of ischemic heart disease.  “Insomnia is actually quite common. We see it probably in 1 in 10 patients in the United States,” said Gulati, who was not involved in the new research. “It is my impression that almost everyone experiences insomnia at some point in their life. The estimate is that 1 in 2 adults experience it at some point in their life, maybe in the short term because of stressful moments.”  For their analysis, the researchers – from medical institutions in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, as well as SUNY Medical University and Harvard Medical School in the United States – defined insomnia as a sleep disorder with three main symptoms:  Difficulty falling asleepDifficulty staying asleepWaking early and being unable to fall back asleepThe analysis included more than 11 years’ worth of data from 1,184,256 adults in the US, the UK, Norway, Germany, Taiwan and China.  Stock image of a woman taking sleeping pills. Stevica Mrdja/Microgen/Adobe StockWomen, older adults and those with lower income are more likely to use sleep medication, survey finds, despite potential health harms Of the participants, 153,881 had insomnia and 1,030,375 did not. The researchers found that those with insomnia were 1.69 times more likely to have a heart attack than people without insomnia. Heart attack numbers were still relatively low – occurring in about 1.6% of people with insomnia and 1.2% of those without.  The study also found an association between increased heart attack risk and how long a participant slept each night. Those who slept five hours or less had the highest association with heart attack risk and were 1.56 times more likely to have a heart attack than people who slept seven or eight hours.  Longer sleep duration wasn’t always more protective. The study found that people who slept six hours a night had a lower risk of a heart attack than those who slept nine hours or more.  “A lot of studies have pointed somewhere between seven and eight hours of sleep being the magic number for us,” Gulati said. “There is obviously variability for everyone, but too much sleep is rarely the issue.”  The study says that the increased heart attack risk among people with insomnia persisted regardless of age or gender.  Adobe StockSleep starts: Why your body 'hiccups' as you fall asleepGulati said there are several ways a lack of sleep can create a higher risk of a heart attack. The regulation of cortisol is central.  Cortisol is a hormone responsible for regulating the body’s response to stress. If levels are too high, it will raise the body’s blood pressure. When a person sleeps well, their blood pressure goes down at night.  “What really happens when you’re not getting enough sleep is that your cortisol gets out of whack,” Gulati said.  “If you are having sleep problems, we know that your blood pressure is more elevated at night.”  Higher blood pressure at night caused by cortisol imbalance is one of the potential pathways to an increased risk of heart disease, she said.   The authors of the study said insomnia should be considered a risk factor in guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter   Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  “Now we have evidence that sleep is medicine,” said the study’s senior author, Dr. Hani Aiash, a cardiologist and assistant dean of interprofessional research in the College of Health Professions at Upstate Medical University. “So good sleep is prevention.  “If you didn’t sleep well … below five hours or six hours, you’re exposing yourself to a higher risk of myocardial infarction. The pattern of sleep is very important.”  However, “we don’t need nine hours,” Aiash said. “Above nine hours is harmful also.”  To avoid insomnia and improve sleep, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends five simple steps:  Being consistent with going to sleep at the same time each night and getting up at a similar time every morning, including weekends. This helps establish a rhythm for your body.Make sure your bedroom is a relaxing, quiet and dark space with a comfortable temperature. Next, remove smartphones, TVs and computers from the room. Avoiding large meals, caffeine and alcohol before bedtime gives your body the best chance at sleeping well.Finally, remain active during the day.If you’re still struggling with insomnia, talk to a doctor about other remedies and treatments, the CDC says.  Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Dr. Hani Aiash is the senior author of the new study. CNN’s John Bonifield contributed to this report.

In a newly released position paper Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry called for a resumption of peace talks, an end to unilateral sanctions, and stressed its opposition to the use of nuclear weapons – a stance Chinese leader Xi Jinping communicated to Western leaders last year.  The 12-point document is part of Beijing’s latest efforts to present itself as a neutral peace broker, as it struggles to balance its “no-limits” relationship with Moscow and fraying ties with the West as the war drags on.   “Conflict and war benefit no one. All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiraling out of control,” the paper said.  Beijing’s claim to neutrality has been severely undermined by its refusal to acknowledge the nature of the conflict – it has so far avoided calling it an “invasion” – and its diplomatic and economic support for Moscow.  Western officials have also raised concerns that China may be considering providing Russia with lethal military assistance, an accusation denied by Beijing.

And despite claiming the “sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld,” the document fails to acknowledge Russia’s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.  Moscow and Kyiv have both showed some interest in the position paper, but their responses on Friday also emphasized the enormous obstacles to dialogue.  The Russian Foreign Ministry said it “highly appreciates the sincere desire” of China to contribute to settling the conflict, and added that Moscow is open to achieving the goals of its so-called special military operation through political and diplomatic means, including the recognition of “new territorial realities” – something which Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has sworn never to concede.

He said that China talked about territorial integrity in general terms but had not specified any country, adding that Ukraine needed to work on these issues with China.    “It doesn’t say whose territorial integrity but our country’s territorial integrity has been violated,” Zelensky said.   When asked how he would bring countries geopolitically removed from Ukraine onto his side, Zelensky said: “As far as I know, China respects territorial integrity, historically, has respected it and therefore must do whatever they can for the Russian Federation to leave our territory because that would mean respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.”Thinly veiled criticismMuch of the language used in the document appears targeted at the West. In a thinly veiled criticism of the United States, the paper said, “Cold War mentality” should be abandoned.  “The security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs. The legitimate security interests and concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and addressed properly,” it said, apparently echoing Moscow’s view the West provoked the war through the expansion of NATO.  It also appears to criticize the wide-ranging economic sanctions imposed by the US and other Western countries on Russia. “Unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure cannot solve the issue; they only create new problems,” it said. “Relevant countries should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ against other countries, so as to do their share in deescalating the Ukraine crisis.”  The paper was swiftly criticized by American officials, with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan saying the war “could end tomorrow if Russia stopped attacking Ukraine and withdrew its forces.”  “My first reaction to it is that it could stop at point one, which is to respect the sovereignty of all nations,” Sullivan told CNN. “Ukraine wasn’t attacking Russia. NATO wasn’t attacking Russia. The United States wasn’t attacking Russia. This was a war of choice waged by Putin.”  The flags of Russia and China flutter on the roof of a hotel with the flags of other countries removed, in central St. Petersburg, Russia, Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky)Dmitri Lovetsky/APIntelligence suggests China is considering sending drones and ammunition to Russia, sources familiar sayIn Beijing, the ambassador of the European Union to China, Jorge Toledo, told reporters at a briefing that China’s position paper was not a peace proposal, adding that the EU is “studying the paper closely,” according to Reuters.   Ukraine, meanwhile, called the position paper “a good sign” but urged China to do more.  “China should do everything in its power to stop the war and restore peace in Ukraine and urge Russia to withdraw its troops,” Ukraine’s Chargé d’Affaires to China Zhanna Leshchynska said at the same briefing in Beijing.  “In neutrality, China should talk to both sides: Russia and Ukraine, and now we can see China is not talking to Ukraine,” she said, noting that Kyiv was not consulted before the release of the paper.  The position paper was first discussed last week by top diplomat Wang Yi at a security conference in Munich, as he attempted to cast Beijing as a responsible negotiator for peace during a diplomatic charm offensive in Europe.   Wang visited Moscow as the final stop of his European tour, and met with Putin on Wednesday.   Putin, who welcomed Wang with outstretched arms as the Chinese diplomat entered the meeting room, said relations between Russia and China were “reaching new milestones.”  “Russian-Chinese relations are developing as we planned in previous years. Everything is moving forward and developing,” Putin told reporters as he sat beside Wang. “Cooperation in the international arena between the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China, as we have repeatedly said, is very important for stabilizing the international situation.”  Wang said the two countries “often face crisis and chaos, but there are always opportunities in a crisis.”  “This requires us to identify changes more voluntarily and respond to the changes more actively to further strengthen our comprehensive strategic partnership,” Wang said.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during the United Nations Security Council meeting on the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine at UN Headquarters in New York City on February 24, 2023. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      On the anniversary of the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday called on the international community not to let Russian President Vladimir Putin’s crimes “become our new normal” – and seemed to tacitly downplay a proposal by Beijing to bring an end to the war.  In his remarks at the United Nations Security Council – just over a year after he told the same forum that Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine – Blinken stressed the need for members of the council, which includes China and Russia, to stand for “the basic principles” of international order, describing the ways that they could do so.  Blinken catalogued a litany of horrific actions committed by Russia over the past year, and spoke of the “inspiring unity” shown by Ukrainians “in helping one another endure Moscow’s relentless assault.” He also spoke about the way “the international community has come together.”  “Nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine, because we all recognize that if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself, and the principles and rules that make all our countries safer and more secure: No seizing land by force. No erasing another country’s borders. No targeting civilians in war,” Blinken said. “If we do not defend these basic principles, we invite a world in which might makes right, the strong dominate the weak.”  WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 18: A statue of Alexander Hamilton stands in front of the Treasury Department on January 18, 2023 in Washington, DC.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned republican and democrat leaders that the federal government will reach its limit on the amount of money it is able to borrow on January 19th and that further action is needed by lawmakers to prevent economic default. Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesUS Treasury takes 'one of its most significant sanctions actions to date' on anniversary of Russia's war against Ukraine“That’s the world this body was created to end. And members of this Council have a unique responsibility to make sure we don’t return to it,” he said.  The top US diplomat said nations must “reaffirm our commitment to upholding what the UN Charter calls ‘the dignity and worth of the human person,’” emphasizing the need to continue to compile evidence of Russian atrocities with the goal of one day achieving accountability for those crimes.  “Day after day of Russia’s atrocities, it’s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage,” he said. “But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal.”  “Bucha is not normal. Mariupol is not normal. Irpin is not normal. Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal. Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not normal,” Blinken said.  “We must not let President Putin’s callous indifference to human life become our own,” Blinken said. “We must force ourselves to remember that behind every atrocity in this wretched war, and in conflicts around the world, is a human being.”  Blinken stressed the need for a “just and durable peace.”China’s proposalIn what could be seen as a dig at China’s newly unveiled 12-point proposal “on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis,” Blinken noted that he expects “many countries will call for peace today,” but “history teaches us that it’s the nature of peace that matters.”  “For peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence. For peace to be durable, it must ensure Russia can’t simply rest, rearm, and relaunch its war in a few months or a few years,” he said. “Any peace that legitimizes Russia’s seizure of land by force will weaken the Charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it.”  The 12-point plan released by Beijing Friday calls for a cessation of hostilities and resumption of peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, stating that “all parties should support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible, so as to gradually deescalate the situation and ultimately reach a comprehensive ceasefire.”  Blinken said that members of the Security Council “should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both sides to stop fighting, or calling on other nations to stop supporting Ukraine in the name of peace.”  “No member of this Council should call for peace while supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine and on the UN Charter,” he said.  In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier on Friday, Blinken said the US was “taking a look” at China’s proposal, but cautioned that Beijing is “trying to have it both ways.”  “There are points in the Chinese plans … that are consistent with things the Ukrainians have long said, that China itself has put out there,” he said. “But look, China’s been trying to have it both ways. It’s on the one hand trying to present itself publicly as neutral and seeking peace, while at the same time it’s talking up Russia’s false narrative about the war. It is, as I said, providing non-lethal assistance through its companies and now contemplating lethal assistance.”  In his remarks at the UN, Blinken also spoke of the need for the UN Security Council to “continue to address other challenges to international peace and security” even while working to end the war.  “We hear the concerns of countries who worry that standing with Ukraine and holding Russia accountable is diverting focus and resources from others in need,” Blinken said.  “To those countries, I would say, simply, look at our actions. And when you hear Russia and its defenders accuse the countries who support Ukraine of ignoring the rest of the world, I say: look at Moscow’s actions,” he said, comparing the US contributions to UN programs to the contributions made by Russia.

A voice, saying it’s coming from a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) airport, crackles over the radio of the US Navy P-8 Poseidon as a CNN crew, given rare access aboard the US flight, listens in.  “American aircraft. Chinese airspace is 12 nautical miles. Not approaching any more or you bear all responsibility,” it says.  In a few minutes, a Chinese fighter jet armed with air-to-air missiles intercepts the US plane, nestling in just 500 feet off its port side.  The Chinese fighter jet was so close, the CNN crew could see the pilots turning their heads to look at them – and could make out the red star on the tail fins and the missiles it was armed with.  Lt. Nikki Slaughter, the pilot of the American plane, hails the twin-seat, twin-engine PLA aircraft.  “PLA fighter aircraft, this is US Navy P-8A … I have you off my left wing and I intend to proceed to the west. I request that you do the same, over.”  There’s no reply from the Chinese fighter jet, which escorted the US plane for 15 minutes before turning away.  To a CNN crew aboard the American jet, it’s stark evidence of the tensions brewing in the South China Sea, and between the US and China.  The commander of this US Navy mission has a different take.  “I’d say its another Friday afternoon in the South China Sea,” Navy Cmdr. Marc Hines tells the CNN crew.

Islands in it, like the Paracels near which the US Navy plane was intercepted Friday, are the subject of overlapping territorial claims in part from China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.  Not only does the strategic waterway hold vast resources of fish, oil and gas, but about a third of global shipping passes through it – worth about $3.4 trillion in 2016, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) China Power Project.   China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast sea, and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants.  The Paracel Islands, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.  Named by 16th century Portuguese mapmakers, they have no indigenous population to speak of, only Chinese military garrisons amounting to 1,400 people, according to the CIA Factbook.  Surrounding them is 12 nautical miles of airspace that China was claiming as its own Friday – a claim Washington doesn’t recognize.     Far to the southeast sits the Spratly Islands chain, just 186 miles from the Philippine island of Palawan.  In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China’s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis.  But Beijing has rejected the tribunal’s ruling and continued its military buildup, building bases in the Spratlys, which it calls the Nansha Islands.  China also conducts regular military exercises in much of the South China Sea and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels in the disputed waters – which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors.  A picture of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy destroyer Changsha as seen on the computer screens of a US Navy P-8A reconnaissance jet over the South China Sea on Friday. Ivan Watson/CNNOn Friday, while flying close to the Philippines, the US Navy P-8 spotted a PLA Navy guided-missile destroyer and descended to around 1,000 feet to get a closer look – bringing more warnings from the PLA.  “US aircraft. US aircraft. This is Chinese naval warship 173. You are approaching to me at low altitude. State your intention over,” a voice comes over the US plane’s radio.   PLA warship 173 is the destroyer Changsha, likely armed with dozens of surface-to-air missiles.   The US plane will keep a safe distance, its pilot, Lt. Slaughter, replies.  “US aircraft. US aircraft. This is Chinese naval warship 173. You are clearly endangering my safety. You are clearly endangering my safety,” the Chinese ship says.  “I am a United States military aircraft. I will maintain a safe distance from your unit,” Slaughter replies, and the US mission continues.  The US Navy says these missions are routine.  US vessels and aircraft operate regularly where international law allows, the Pentagon says. But China claims the US presence in the South China Sea is what’s fueling the tensions.  When a US guided-missile cruiser steamed near the Spratly Islands in November, the PLA said such action “seriously infringes on China’s sovereignty and security” and is “hard proof is that the US is seeking maritime hegemony and militarizing the South China Sea.”  The US Navy said the US cruiser conducted the operation “in accordance with international law and then continued on to conduct normal operations in waters where high seas freedoms apply.”  For Hines, the US commander of Friday’s mission, the tensions are always less when he’s talking with the Chinese side.  Silence brings uncertainty, he says.  “Whenever there’s no response, it leaves questions. Do they understand what were saying? Do they understand our intentions?

Here’s what to expect ahead    			By Chris Isidore, CNN		  Published  2:21 PM EST, Sat February 25, 2023    Link Copied!   New YorkCNN      For Ukraine, the year since Russia’s invasion has been one of widespread death, destruction and displacement, as millions had their lives changed forever. Americans got off easy by comparison, with most feeling the impact of the war only at the gas pump.  But the effect on Americans was far less than it was across Europe, where energy prices for driving and heating climbed much higher. Still, Americans have paid a price for the war, and for the sanctions that the United States and its allies imposed upon Russia after its invasion.   Since Russia is one of the world’s major oil exporters, the sanctions riled global energy markets, where the price of oil is set.  US gas prices shot up $1.48 a gallon, or 42%, to a record $5.02 between the day before Russia’s invasion a year ago and the record price reached on June 14.  That peak was short-lived — the national average price of gasoline, as tracked by OPIS for AAA, fell continually for 98 straight days starting right after that record was reached in June until September 20. On Friday, the one-year anniversary of the invasion, the national average stood at $3.39 a gallon, compared to $3.54 on the day the war started.  But even with the steady decline since that June record high, US drivers spent $528 billion on gasoline last year, up $120 billion from what they spent in 2021, according to OPIS. That works out to about $900 more per US household.   Last year’s total is nearly double the amount spent on gasoline in 2020, when stay-at-home orders and massive job losses in the pandemic’s early months crashed demand for gasoline and sent prices plunging. Even compared to pre-pandemic 2019, the amount spent on gas last year jumped $156 billion, or $1,200 per household on average.  Why prices shot up, then fellA number of factors have coincided to bring prices steadily lower since then. Now, a year after the start of the war, crude oil prices on global markets and the retail price of regular gas across most of the United States are below pre-war levels.  And forecasts suggest they will stay that way going forward. OPIS expects the average price throughout the course of 2023 to come in around $3.45, down from $3.96 last year. Even some higher forecasts, such as one from Goldman Sachs, estimates an annual average of $3.87 this year.  To understand why they’re down, it’s important to understand why they went up so much and so fast.   Crude oil prices are determined on global commodity markets. And to some extent, those markets overreacted to the start of the war.  “The market’s reaction was due to uncertainty,” said oil analyst Andy Lipow. He said that those trading oil futures thought the global market would have to find a replacement for all the Russian oil when there wasn’t an alternative available.  But Russian oil shipments continued even with the sanctions, although they were redirected elsewhere. Instead of sending much of its oil and refined products to Europe, Russia sent them to countries like China, India and Turkey.   And the sanctions never completely shut down the shipments of oil to Europe, although a price cap limited the shipments and the amount that buyers in those countries would be willing to pay.  So the sanctions achieved the goal of reducing the revenue Russia got from oil sales.They also they allowed global prices to retreat from the June peak.  “There was a belief Russian production would be crimped. But its production is close to what it was a year ago,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.  In addition, the United States and its allies announced in March they would start releasing oil from their stockpiles of crude, such as the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, putting downward pressure on prices.Economic outlook also drove oil pricesOil is traded globally in US dollars, and the strong dollar that benefitted from the Federal Reserve’s historic interest rate hikes helped to limit the effect of the price hikes on US consumers, even as drivers who pay in other currencies had to spend far more.  Few things take a bite out of gas prices like a recession, or even just the fear of one.  People who lose their jobs don’t have to commute andpull back their spending on discretionary items like travel. Consumption falls, followed by prices.   LONDON, ENGLAND - FEBRUARY 02: A Shell petrol station is pictured on February 2, 2023 in London, England.

(Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images)Carl Court/Getty ImagesBig Oil faces scrutiny after huge jump in profitsA prime example of this took place during the Great Recession 15 years ago. The average price of a gallon of regular gas hit a then-record of $4.11 in early July 2008, according to OPIS data. Six months later, following the meltdown in financial markets, and massive job losses, it was down 61% to $1.62.   RIsing fears of a global and US recession roiled markets in late 2022, pushing down the price of oil futures. Fears of a US recession have receded recently, with very strong reports on US job growth and retail sales, but they’re not gone — particularly not with the Fed expected to continue raising interest rates.  Finally, while many of the restrictions on daily activity imposed during the pandemic have disappeared in the United States and Europe, China lockdowns in late 2022 hurt worldwide gasoline consumption, and with it global prices. China has since reopened but whether it stays open remains to be seen. Price below pre-war levelsBy the end of November, the national average price for a gallon of regular had fallen below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before the invasion. It has remained below that mark ever since, even though it’s up a bit from the post-invasion low of $3.10 a gallon in the week around Christmas. That is typically a time period that sees the lowest pump prices of the year.  Of course, the national average might not have much to do with what the stations near you are charging. There’s a wide variation in prices, with Western states, particularly California, paying much more because of a drop in refining capacity there and tougher environmental rules.  “It’s easy to say we’re not going to match last year’s prices,” said Kloza. “It might be a year when California is paying $6, and Texas is at $2.99.”    RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Camp toy store pleads for help after Silicon Valley Bank collapse    Mar 11, 2023  Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

But researchers now think the world has five major layers after discovering a previously undetectable 400-mile-wide ball of iron inside Earth’s inner core. The revelation could help experts understand more about the origins of the place we call home.  And then there are the hidden layers of history beneath our feet — roads, cities and ways of life that have been covered over and forgotten with the passage of time.   As we dig down into those lost chapters, stories have a way of coming to life again.UnearthedThousands of artifacts were recovered during train tunnel construction in Amsterdam.Monuments and Archaeology/City of AmsterdamWhen engineers tunneled beneath Amsterdam’s centuries-old architecture to build the North-South metro line, it was like stepping back in time.  The arduous 15-year operation resulted in a subterranean train system — and an underground museum filled with 10,000 artifacts uncovered during the process.  Archaeologists sorted through the mud displaced during the project and found myriad objects, including 115,000-year-old shells, medieval relics and even vintage cell phones.   Visitors can see items on display at Rokin station, where many of the artifacts revealing Amsterdam’s past were found.CuriositiesA bell-shaped fungus that humans have used as a fire starter for centuries could now prove useful in the fight against the climate crisis.  The hardy organism, nicknamed “tinder fungus,” might one day replace some plastics.    Part of the fungus has a strength similar to plywood or leather, but it weighs less than either one.  Scientists think the fungus could end up as shock absorbers in sporting equipment and other consumer goods.

The exoplanet, called TOI 5205b, is about the size of Jupiter, Earth’s largest planetary neighbor. The unusual world was discovered orbiting a small, cool star with just a fraction of our sun’s light, size and warmth.   Researchers don’t understand how such a large planet came to exist around the minuscule star, hence its forbidden existence. But the gas giant is causing scientists to question what they know about how planets form.   Meanwhile, scientists found an ancient riverbed in Earth’s oldest, driest desert that is surprisingly similar to Jezero Crater on Mars.A long time agoThe tomb of two brothers who lived during the Bronze Age more than 3,000 years ago may help shed light on some of history’s medical mysteries.   The brothers, likely of high status, lived in the city of Megiddo in what’s now Israel. Both men had debilitating chronic diseases, according to a new analysis of their remains.  Sometime after the younger man died, his older sibling underwent an operation. A square-shaped hole was cut into his skull, and he died not long afterward. Now, a research team is puzzling over the ancient brain surgery and why the skull pieces were buried in the grave.  In a discovery from even further back in time, archaeologists excavating a cave in southern France found the oldest evidence of bow and arrow use by early modern humans outside Africa.Fantastic creaturesAfrican penguins protect their eggs inside artificial nests.African Penguin Nest ProjectTiny white huts springing up on the beaches of South Africa and its coastal islands are a little small for human vacationers — but the dwellings are just right for another type of avid beachgoer.   The domes have many selling points — they’re well ventilated and offer a great view of the sea. And above all, the structures provide a safe place for breeding penguins to mate and protect their eggs.   Human activity and the climate crisis have caused the African penguin population to drop. That’s why conservationists with the African Penguin Nest Project stepped in to create artificial nests.  The project began in 2018. Within minutes, the endangered penguins ran straight inside their new homes.

Both Sullivan and Samantha Power, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, took questions at the town hall from Americans and Ukrainians Thursday, on topics ranging from how the US will keep arming Ukraine to an assessment of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions and the role China may play in the conflict.  The US officials praised the resilience of the Ukrainian people as they were questioned by Ukrainians including a 14-year-old girl and a soldier serving on the front lines of the war in the country’s military.   Here are the top takeaways from the town hall on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion: ‘Russia has already lost’US officials have signaled that the war is likely to drag on for months still, with no real end in sight.  But Sullivan argued that one year into the conflict, Ukraine has already stopped Russia from accomplishing its main objective of taking over the capital of Kyiv.  “Russia’s aims in this war were to wipe Ukraine off the map, to take the capital and to eliminate Ukraine, to absorb it into Russia,” Sullivan said. “They failed at doing that and they are in no position to be able to do that as we go forward.”  Putin’s aims as the war has dragged on was another topic that was raised at the town hall. Sullivan was asked about the risk that Putin could turn to nuclear weapons, and he said that the US had seen no change in Russia’s nuclear posture.  “Sitting here today, we do not see movements in Russia’s nuclear forces that lead us to believe that something fundamentally has changed from how things have been over the course of the past year,” Sullivan said.Ukrainian troops want to know weapons will keep coming During the town hall, Sullivan touted the latest US security assistance that the Biden administration has authorized to Ukraine – a $2 billion package of weapons that’s expected to be officially announced on Friday as the war hits the 1-year mark.  The $2 billion package includes new funding for contracts including HIMARS rockets, 155-millimeter artillery ammunition, drones, counter-drone equipment, mine-clearing equipment and secure communications equipment.  Sullivan was asked by a Ukrainian soldier named Yegor, currently serving on the front lines, whether the US would be able to increase production of ammunition and other weapons to Ukraine, such as 155-millimeter artillery shells and HIMARS.  “One of the things that we are working hard at – at President Biden’s direction – is to increase the production of all of these types of ammunition,” Sullivan said. “This is not something we can do with the snap of a finger, but it’s something that we are putting immense effort and resources into.” There are limits to US assistanceSullivan told Zakaria that the US has provided Ukraine with the assistance it needs for each phase of the war since it began one year ago.  But he also acknowledged that the Ukrainians have often asked for more than the US is willing to give – though in many cases the Biden administration has eventually transferred weapons it had initially resisted sending.  Sullivan reiterated the Biden administration’s position Thursday evening that it’s not currently providing F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, saying the fighter jets “are not the key capability” Ukraine needs for a counteroffensive against Russian forces.  Still, Sullivan noted that the F-16s came up during Biden’s trip earlier this week when he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is pushing for F-16s.  “F-16s are not a question for the short-term fight. F-16s are a question for the long-term defense of Ukraine and that’s a conversation that President Biden and President Zelensky had,” Sullivan said.  Sullivan noted that there is flexibility in the US position on weapons, as the administration weighs the risks of escalation with Ukraine’s security needs throughout the war. Biden agreed to provide Abrams tanks to Ukraine – which the US has argued aren’t as relevant as German Leopard tanks – because Germany wanted the US to provide tanks before it was willing to do so itself, he said.US closely watching China’s role in the conflictZakaria asked Sullivan for his first reaction Thursday evening to a 12-point plan Beijing released calling for the end of hostilities in Ukraine and pitching itself as a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv.   “Well my first reaction to it is they could stop at point one, which is respect the sovereignty of all nations,” Sullivan said. “This war could end tomorrow if Russia stopped attacking Ukraine and withdrew its forces. Ukraine wasn’t attacking Russia, NATO wasn’t attacking Russia, the United States wasn’t attacking Russia. This was a war of choice waged by Putin.”  The same week Beijing released its 12-point plan, US officials have warned that China could be preparing to provide lethal military aid to Russia. Sullivan said Thursday night that such a move has not been ruled out yet.   Still, Sullivan argued that the idea that the two countries are becoming “unbreakable allies” is disproven because China has taken a careful stance toward Russia’s war, noting they abstained instead of voting with Moscow on a recent United Nations resolution.   “They have tried to pitch themselves as somehow not standing fully in Russia’s camp when it comes to the war in Ukraine,” Sullivan said.Biden officials say US will not abandon Ukraine Both Sullivan and Power brushed aside criticism from some of Biden’s Republican critics that the billions of dollars the US is spending in Ukraine would be better spent at home.  Many Republicans, including some 2024 hopefuls, have argued aid to Ukraine should be scaled back or cut off as the war stretches on. With Republicans in control of the House, passing additional funding packages for Ukraine is expected to be a tougher lift this year.    Sullivan argued that the US can afford to spend money on problems at home as well as abroad.  “I would say to those senators, yes, let’s do these things at home. But are you saying that American is incapable of also helping to serve as a powerful force of good in the world?” Sullivan said.   “I think there’s a pessimism in this argument that these senators are making. President Biden has an optimistic view, which is that we can do it, and we should do it, and we are doing it.”   Power argued that US support for Ukraine is actually one of the rare issues where there is strong bipartisanship in today’s Washington, when she was asked by a Ukrainian mother about the commonality between the citizens of the two countries.  “The reflection, I think, of how much commonality Americans do feel with Ukrainians is the flow of support that has been sustained over the course of this last year,” Power said. “It is the bipartisanship in a town that isn’t famous for it anymore, but Ukraine has been not only a galvanizing issue, but a uniting issue for our own country.”   Lera, a 14-year-old Ukrainian girl, asked Power whether she could rely on American to feel safe in her country. Power responded that the US was committed to making Ukrainians feel as safe as possible despite the war.  “We have your backs, we stand with you, not just here on the battle front but in trying to help you feel as much safety as you can when one man and his wicked vision has tried to take that away,” Power said.Reconstruction of Ukraine is going to be a ‘mammoth undertaking’ Power acknowledged the long road ahead for Ukraine to rebuild the country when the war ends. Some estimates have totaled the damage to date at $130 billion, she noted.  “This is going to be a mammoth undertaking,” she said.  Power said that USAID and international financial institutions have worked to rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure and help get private industry to return to peaceful parts of Ukraine.   But she added that major projects are still ahead, and that the Biden administration and other allies are focused on making sure the money that’s dedicated to reconstruction is well spent.   “The other thing we want to do now is, with an eye to those big-ticket items, most of which will only happen when there’s a negotiated peace,” Power said.   “But we have to make sure resources are going to be well spent,” she added. “When you have those huge investments, which go well beyond what is being provided right now, that’s when of course you want to make sure that you have the safeguards in place so that all outside investors and donors can know and say to their citizens that this is money that’s going to be well spent.”   Power said that to this point, the Biden administration has not seen evidence that US assistance was being misused.  “Again, the key is not resting on anybody’s good will or virtue,” she said. “It’s checks and balances, the rule of law, the integrity of officials.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Video Ad FeedbackHow Russia tries to circumvent sanctions    13:47   - Source:CNNCNN      A year of unprecedented, US-led sanctions designed to isolate one of the world’s largest economies has left Russia weakened, but not incapacitated. Instead of the forecast double-digit GDP drop, Russia’s economy contracted by about 3% last year. After an initial crash heralded by President Joe Biden, the country’s currency has stabilized. And while US export controls have restricted Russia’s ability to obtain necessary components to manufacture some sophisticated military hardware, Russia has found countries willing to help keep its war machine humming.   If the first year of the US-led sanctions campaign was all about cutting Russia off from the global economy and degrading its military industrial complex, year two will be focused on sealing the cracks.   Biden administration officials say they will apply a laser-like focus on cracking down on Russia’s sanction evasion efforts, which span adversaries like China as well as allies and partners like Turkey, India and the United Arab Emirates.  That focus will include an important shift: After a year focused on trying to wrangle countries into compliance with US sanctions through a combination of technical assistance and delicate diplomacy, the administration now plans to take its efforts directly to individual companies.   The administration will present “a clear choice” to those companies, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told CNN in an interview.   “If they continue to sell Russia materials in support of their war effort, then they’re not going to have access to the economies of our coalition, which frankly represent a far bigger customer to them,” Adeyemo said.   That effort started on Friday, when the administration announced sanctions for “over 200 individuals and entities, including both Russian and third-country actors across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East that are supporting Russia’s war effort.” Those sanctions were imposed along with the US’ partners in the G7 and other allies.  Still, the one-year macroeconomic effects are less than Biden administration officials predicted publicly at the outset. But, while Russia has successfully mitigated some of the short-term pain, Biden administration officials and sanctions experts predict devastating long-term consequences lie ahead for an increasingly isolated Russian economy.“The contraction this year is smaller than what I predicted publicly, but to my mind what Putin has done is prop up this year’s growth, in an accounting sense, by sacrificing long term growth potential,” said Daleep Singh, Biden’s former deputy national security adviser and one of the primary architects of the Russia sanctions.   “The lasting consequence of this war will be that Russia has lost Europe and the G7 as energy consumers and that’s going to dry out the major source of export revenue that remains. And it’s going to leave Russia as a smaller, weaker, more isolated economy,” Singh said.   These new efforts come at a critical moment in the war – both Ukraine and Russia appear to be gearing up for a spring offensive and the high-expenditure, artillery-based warfare is drawing attention to dwindling Western munitions stockpiles. That has raised the stakes for the West to deliver a powerful blow to Russia’s defense industrial base and its ability to finance its war effort. Russia finds nations willing to make a deal A recently enacted price cap on Russian oil is taking a significant bite out of Russia’s revenues. But amid the crush of Western sanctions, Russia has found alternative sources of revenue by increasing its exports to China, Brazil, India and Turkey. Some of those very countries are also backfilling Russian demand for key products and technologies the US and its coalition have cut off.   Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are increasingly urging the administration to get more aggressive with countries that are helping Russia get around the sanctions.   “I do think we need to apply more pressure on these countries and not allow them to become an escape valve for Vladimir Putin and his efforts to fund the war machine,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who has said the US should withhold advanced F-16s from Turkey.   Multiple administration officials declined to say whether they are considering more coercive steps to get friendly countries like Turkey and India on board with the sanctions effort. Instead, they emphasized a combination of rigorous diplomacy and increased enforcement of sanctions to plug existing holes.   “I wouldn’t say this is us standing around, gnashing our teeth in frustration. It’s instead just doing the hard work of making sure our sanctions are effective,” a senior administration official said.   The latest round of sanctions, expected this week around the first anniversary of the war, are expected to make that point, focusing on sanctions evasion networks and Russia’s military production.   Treasury and Commerce Department officials have traveled to countries key to Russia’s evasion and backfilling efforts in recent months to secure more cooperation. Just last month, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson traveled to the United Arab Emirates and Turkey – two close US security partners that have also been hubs of Russian sanctions evasion – and warned of new measures the US could take to crackdown.   “Countries all around the world that seek to backfill the Russian war machine should attempt to evade our controls at their own peril,” Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves said. ‘Deglobalization of a large economy’ Sanctions experts say the scale of the US’ sanctions on an economy as large and connected as Russia’s is unprecedented.   “This is a major example of deglobalization of a large economy, which we haven’t seen ever before,” said Vladimir Milov, a Russian economist and opposition politician who served as deputy minister of energy in 2002.   In the first days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US and its allies worked quickly to impose devastating sanctions on Russia’s central bank and its major private banks, freezing about $300 billion of Russian reserves and disconnecting those banks from the global financial messaging system, known as SWIFT. Since then, the US has sanctioned more than 2,000 Russian firms and individuals.   Russian industrial production has suffered, the country’s military is struggling to obtain key components to produce some weaponry and hundreds of international companies have exited the Russian market, amplifying the effect of US sanctions.   Anastassia Fedyk, an assistant professor of finance at the University of California-Berkeley and member of the International Working Group on Russian Sanctions, pointed to the long-term impacts the war and sanctions regime will have on the Russian economy.   “These are going to be cumulative effects,” she said. “I think looking forward, the outlook is not positive for the Russian economy at all.”    While a senior administration official conceded that the administration did not anticipate the extent to which energy prices surged following Russia’s invasion – in turn boosting revenues on Russia’s primary export – officials are convinced the price cap on Russian oil will deliver a blow to Russia’s ability to finance its war effort.   Already, Western oil sanctions are beginning to hit their mark, sending Russian oil and gas revenues down 46% last month compared to the prior year and leaving Russia with a $25 billion budget deficit.   Asked to reflect on key moments in the year of US sanctions against Russia, both Adeyemo and Singh pointed to the initial round of crushing financial sanctions within days of the invasion as the moment Russia’s economic fate was sealed.   “I remember vividly waking up at 3 a.m., talking to my counterpart in the EU, Bjoern Seibert, and saying, ‘It’s go time,’” Singh said. “By 5 p.m., the package was made public and it was a moment when the major democracies of the world moved faster and stronger than we had in decades.”   “When we look back a decade from now, that’ll be the moment where Russia’s economy went from one that was opening up, and it was growing and becoming more European, and where Russia’s economy started to deteriorate and started the slow decline that will make it look more like Iran’s economy a decade from now,” Adeyemo said.

It is unclear how many additional US troops will take part in the expanded training efforts.   On Tuesday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen told a visiting bipartisan US congressional delegation that the two militaries will cooperate “even more closely” and plan to “bolster military exchanges.”  A congressional aide to a Democratic member of the delegation told CNN, “Enhanced military and economic ties have been the focal point of conversations with political, business, and military leaders. The Communist Party of China’s disinformation and influence campaign against Taiwan should also be addressed through deeper cooperation with the United States.”  Even a modest increase in the number of troops in Taiwan could increase tensions with China, which has watched in recent months as the US has strengthened its posture around the island, bolstering forces in nearby Okinawa and Guam. In response, China accused the US of undermining peace and stability in the region.  The friction extends beyond the Indo-Pacific. This week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China may provide Russia with lethal support for its war in Ukraine. China’s foreign ministry fired back that the US and NATO were smearing China.

In an exclusive interview with CNN in 2021, the Taiwanese president acknowledged that there were US military personnel on the island at the time but said it was “not as many as people thought,” adding that Taipei has a “a wide range of cooperation with the US aiming at increasing our defense capability.”  According to Defense Department data, the US has had between 20 and 40 troops based in Taiwan in recent years. Most are Marines, who are tasked with embassy and diplomatic security at the de facto US embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan. The US does not have an official embassy in Taiwan since it does not recognize the island as an independent nation.  The expansion of training was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.  Last summer, Taiwanese troops took part in the Northern Strike exercise led by the Michigan National Guard. The annual two-week exercise was conducted in August at Camp Grayling, just days after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically-governed territory, sparking an angry reaction from China, including a military show of force around the island.  Antony Blinken and Wang YiBlinken and Chinese counterpart meet in first face-to-face since spy balloon shot downHow many Taiwanese troops took part in the multi-national exercise is unclear, but Taiwan could participate once again this coming summer. The exercise, which also has a smaller winter phase, has approximately 7,000 annual participants.  Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to comment on the plans to expand training of Taiwanese forces.   “We don’t have a comment on specific operations, engagements, or training, but I would highlight that our support for, and defense relationship with, Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China,” Ryder said in a statement.

These latest actions by the Treasury Department are among a series of new measures announced by the Biden administration Friday that are meant to strengthen Kyiv and deter those providing support to Moscow as the war enters its second year without signs of abating.  Friday’s sweeping actions are meant to fill in gaps in existing sanctions that have been imposed over the past year of the war and are intended to impair “key revenue generating sectors in order to further degrade Russia’s economy and diminish its ability to wage war against Ukraine,” according to a White House fact sheet.  CNNTakeaways from CNN's town hall a year after Russia invaded Ukraine The administration on Friday imposed sanctions against a total of “over 200 individuals and entities, including both Russian and third-country actors across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East that are supporting Russia’s war effort,” according to the White House fact sheet.  The latest tranche of Treasury Department sanctions target a total of 22 individuals and 83 entities, according to a Treasury Department news release, and were taken in coordination with the Group of 7 nations.   The US State Department also imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian officials and entities involved in the war and will take “steps to impose visa restrictions on 1,219 members of the Russian military, including officers, for actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. Three Russian military officials – Artyom Igorevich Gorodilov, Aleksey Sergeyevich Bulgakov, and Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasilyev – will be blocked from entering the US due to their involvement “in gross violations of human rights perpetrated against Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of wars,” Blinken said.  In addition to the sanctions, the US Commerce Department on Friday took “several export control actions, listing nearly 90 Russian and third country companies, including in China among other countries, on the Entity List for engaging in sanction evasion and backfill activities in support of Russia’s defense sector,” the White House fact sheet said.  “Our economic sanctions, export controls, and tariffs announced this week, in coordination with the G7, demonstrate that we will continue to work with our allies and partners to increase the pressure on President Putin, make it harder for him to wage his brutal war, and continue degrading the Russian economy’s ability to fuel continued aggression,” Blinken said.Targeting sanctions evasionFriday’s Treasury sanctions specifically target individuals and companies based outside of Russia that are connected to sanctions evasion, “including those related to arms trafficking and illicit finance,” the Treasury news release said.  For weeks, Biden administration officials had been previewing plans to crack down on those helping Moscow work around sanctions to continue its war against Kyiv. Top State Department official Victoria Nuland detailed some of the sanctions evasion efforts Thursday, describing Russia as “importing 1000% more laptops, iPhones, dishwashers from third-countries, not because they need to, you know, work at home on their laptops but so they can cannibalize this machinery to get the advanced chips that we have denied them so that they can make more rockets, etc.”  “We are going to get those evaders,” Nuland said last week.  Among those sanctioned  by the Treasury Department Friday are Swiss-Italian businessman Walter Moretti “and his network of associates and companies” – including companies based in Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Malta, Bulgaria and Russia – whom the Treasury Department said “have covertly procured sensitive Western technologies and equipment for Russian intelligence services and the Russian military, including hydraulic presses, armament packages, and armor plating.”  “Moretti and his associates have also procured equipment for Russia’s nuclear weapons laboratories,” the Treasury Department said.State Department sanctions ‘complicit’ Russian officialsIn a coordinated action, the US State Department announced a slew of sanctions on Friday, hitting “over 60 individuals and entities” who have been “complicit” in Moscow’s aggression toward Ukraine and “the illegitimate administration of occupied Ukrainian territories for the benefit of the Russian Federation,” Blinken said in a statement.   “These targets include government ministers, governors, and high-level officials in Russia, as well as six individuals and three entities operating in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia, facilitating grain theft, and governing on behalf of Russia,” he said.  The State Department sanctioned “those engaged in Russia’s illegitimate control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP),” Blinken said, noting that “Russia’s military attacks on, and subsequent seizure of the ZNPP, have only underscored the global concerns related to nuclear energy security and undermine the Kremlin’s efforts to portray itself as a responsible supplier of nuclear energy products.”  “Further, the Department is designating three key enterprises that develop and operate Russia’s nuclear weapons as well as three Russian civil nuclear entities under the Rosatom organizational structure. In taking these actions, we highlight that Russia uses energy resources, including in the nuclear sector, to exert political and economic pressure on its customers globally,” the top US diplomat said.  The State Department also sanctioned four individuals and 22 entities in Russia’s advanced technology sector, Blinken said, adding that they are specifically “targeting manufacturers and developers of hardware and software for Russia’s intelligence collection capabilities through its System for Operational-Search Measures as part of our efforts to degrade Russia’s capacity to violently expand its imperial project around the globe.”  In addition, they hit three companies “involved in expanding Russia’s future energy production and export capacity,” including those “involved in the design and construction of the Sever Bay Terminal as part of the Vostok oil projects,” Blinken said. Treasury Department hits Russia’s financial institutionsThe latest tranche of Treasury Department sanctions hit “over a dozen financial institutions in Russia, including one of the top-ten largest banks by asset value” – Credit Bank of Moscow Public Joint Stock Company – and wealth management firms. The Treasury Department explained that individuals under sanction have “been known to turn to smaller banks as well as wealth-management firms in an attempt to evade sanctions as Russia seeks new ways to access the international financial system.”  The agency also imposed sanctions on Nurmurad Kurbanov, “a Russian-Turkmen arms dealer who has represented Russian and Belarusian defense firms abroad” and Aleksandr Yevgenyevich Udodov, a Russian businessman with ties to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, who is accused of illicit financial activities.  In addition to targeting those involved with sanctions evasion, the Treasury Department took actions meant to weaken Moscow’s military supply chains.  The latest sanctions hit “numerous Russia-based entities involved in the production of carbon fiber and related materials” – materials that “are used in almost all defense-related platforms including aircraft, ground combat vehicles, ballistic missiles, and military personal protection gear, as well as other weapons systems.” They also imposed sanctions on companies tied to Russia’s aerospace, technology and electronics sectors.  “As the Ukrainian people continue to valiantly defend their homeland and their freedom, the United States is proud to support Ukraine through economic, security, and humanitarian assistance,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. “Over the past year, we have taken actions with a historic coalition of international partners to degrade Russia’s military-industrial complex and reduce the revenues that it uses to fund its war.”  “Our sanctions have had both short-term and long-term impact, seen acutely in Russia’s struggle to replenish its weapons and in its isolated economy. Our actions today with our G7 partners show that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,” she said.

CNN reported Thursday that the US is planning to increase the number of US troops training Taiwanese forces on the self-governing island in the coming months, something Austin declined to confirm. In recent weeks China accused the US of undermining peace and stability in the region after it strengthened its posture around Taiwan by bolstering forces in nearby Okinawa and Guam.  CNNUS defense secretary tells CNN military aid to Ukraine will 'change the dynamics' of war with RussiaAnd tensions significantly escalated at the beginning of the month when a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon was drifting tens of thousands of feet up across the continental United States. President Joe Biden eventually ordered it shot down off the coast of South Carolina after officials determined that the risk the balloon would pose to civilians and property on the ground if shot down outweighed the intelligence collection risk it presented.  Chinese officials claimed that the balloon was a “civilian airship” for research and weather purposes which had drifted off course, though the US reaffirmed it had surveillance capabilities.   Austin told CNN that it’s possible Chinese President Xi Jinping did not know about the balloon, but he would “let the Chinese speak for themselves.”  Austin did emphasize that that while he and Wei haven’t spoken during that period, it doesn’t mean the US doesn’t have other lines of communications open with different Chinese officials.  “You just saw [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] talk to his counterpart in Munich,” he said Thursday. “And so there are diplomatic lines of communication open. But I think for the military, it’s really, really important that we maintain open lines of communication.”  An ‘ill-advised’ moveOn top of existing tensions, US officials have begun warning partners and allies of intelligence that showed China could provide lethal military aid to Russia’s military in Ukraine. The issue was even raised at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend in a conversation between Blinken and his counterpart, Wang Yi.   “The Secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,” a senior State Department official previously told reporters.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been ongoing for a year now, with no signs of slowing. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels last week that Russia is “now a global pariah” since its invasion of Ukraine, and has lost “strategically, operationally, and tactically.”  Austin added last week from Brussels that they expect to see Ukraine conduct an offensive in the spring against Russia.  Thus far, China has not appeared to actually go through with sending lethal aid to Russia, Austin said in the interview, but it has not been “taken off the table.”   “[T]here’s reputational risk, and of course, I’m sure China would love to enjoy a good relationship with all the countries in Europe,” he said. “And again, if you just look at the numbers of countries around the world, that really think that what Russia has done is horrible, I mean, adding to that, I think China – it would be a very ill-advised step for China to take.”   China has a “lot of capability in terms of munitions and weapons,” Austin added, “and if they provide the substantial support to Russia, it prolongs the conflict.”    CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed reporting.

Video Ad FeedbackCNN reports from frontline town in Ukraine obliterated by grinding battles    03:53   - Source:CNNCNN      If you’ve looked at flights lately, you may have been taken aback by current ticket prices. The busy travel season is heating up, which means heightened demand and more expensive airfares. But if you time things right and target the “Goldilocks Window,” there’s a good chance you’ll snag a deal – even during the peak period.   Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.   (You can get “CNN’s 5 Things” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. UkraineToday marks one year since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that despite all the hardships resulting from the war, 2023 will be a major turning point in the conflict. “It was a year of pain, sorrow, faith, and unity. And this year, we remained invincible. We know that 2023 will be the year of our victory,” Zelensky said in a statement. Many residents have left the capital of Kyiv today, fearing a new wave of potential Russian attacks. Meanwhile, Ukraine has called on its allies to “redouble” their support at this “crucial stage of the war,” Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said today. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has vowed the US would do everything it could to get Ukraine the key equipment it needs, although he said F-16 fighter jets – which Kyiv has requested – were not “the key capability” needed for now.2. Ohio toxic trainFederal officials released an initial report Thursday concluding that the toxic train wreck in East Palestine, Ohio, was completely preventable. The report found that one of the train’s cars carrying plastic pellets was heated by a hot axle that sparked the initial fire, according to Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the safety board. As the temperature of the bearing got hotter, the train passed by two wayside defect detectors that did not trigger an audible alarm message because the heat threshold was not met at that point, Homendy explained. A third detector eventually picked up the high temperature, but it was already too late by then. The report outlined how investigators will continue examining procedures, practices and design prior to the train’s derailment. So far, the investigation found no evidence the crew did anything wrong prior to the incident.3. Extreme weatherA winter storm moving across the US is causing numerous power outages, flight cancellations and road closures – and has put millions of people under weather warnings. More than 828,000 customers are without power this morning due to weather, according to PowerOutage.us. Millions of others are under various alerts across the West into the northern Plains, Great Lakes region, New York and New England. In a rare event, some areas of Southern California will be under blizzard warnings today, the National Weather Service said. Meanwhile, temperatures are heating up across the Southeast, where at least 50 record highs were reported on Thursday. The dueling winter storm and southern heat wave created a stark 100-degree temperature difference between the Northern Rockies and the South earlier this week. 4. Voting rightsMinnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz is poised to sign a bill that would speed up the right to vote for ex-felons. Walz is expected to sign the legislation, referred to as Restore the Vote by its supporters, into law as early as next week, his office said. The bill will restore the voting rights of thousands of convicted felons this summer once they leave prison, instead of after they complete parole. Once signed by Walz, the measure means Minnesota will join 21 other states that automatically restore the right to vote for some or all ex-felons upon their release from prison. But the bill hasn’t been without legal challenges and contentious political debate. Removing obstacles to voting for former felons has been the subject of partisan bickering in some states because of the perception that this group of voters is more likely to support Democratic candidates.5. Harvey WeinsteinHarvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood mogul already serving a 23-year prison sentence in New York, was sentenced in Los Angeles Thursday to an additional 16 years in prison for charges of rape and sexual assault. Prior to the sentence, Weinstein spoke in court and continued to deny any wrongdoing. “I never knew this woman, and the fact is she doesn’t know me. This is about money,” he said. “Please don’t sentence me to life in prison. I don’t deserve it,” he added. The sentencing was the second for Weinstein on sexual assault charges since reporting by The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017 revealed his alleged history of sexual abuse, harassment and secret settlements as he used his influence as a Hollywood power broker to take advantage of young women.BREAKFAST BROWSE‘Cocaine Bear’ reviewThe killer-animal comedy premieres in US theaters today.

Russian salespeople stand by a tent for Russian weapons manufacturers at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Monday. Jon Gambrell/APEditor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.Abu DhabiCNN      At a major international defense exhibition in the United Arab Emirates this week, tucked away in a distant corner, a large purple structure featuring Russia’s name has been erected far from the sight of most visitors.    The biennial International Defence Exhibition (IDEX) in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi is the largest defense conference in the Middle East, with the participation of over 1,300 exhibitors from 65 countries.    But what makes it stand out from other major arms fairs is its participants. Invitees include military officials and manufacturers from countries that aren’t friendly with each other. Delegates from China and the United States, Russia and Ukraine, India and Pakistan, and Israel and Arab states are present at the same event.   Eight Russian arms manufacturing firms were exhibiting at the fair, including Kalashnikov Group and Rosoboronexport. In a statement to CNN, IDEX said it was “proud that this year’s edition is the largest in the event’s 30-year history.”   Russia has participated in the exhibition before, but this year, its presence is particularly sensitive.    One year since Russia launched its war on Ukraine, the UAE’s balancing act at IDEX demonstrates a wider policy across the Middle East of discreet neutrality, as well as the United States’ inability to sway its Middle Eastern allies to join the Western camp.   An oil refinery at sunset in Qatar in May 2020. Robin Constable/Eye Ubiquitous/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesMiddle East oil exporters are cashing in as Ukraine war hits global economy“It has been clear since the start of the Russian invasion a year ago that America’s regional partners in the Middle East… were not going to take sides or get involved in the great power competition and strategic rivalry that has taken on a harder edge since 2022,” said Kristian Ulrichsen, a political scientist at Rice University’s Baker Institute in Houston, Texas.    “So, to that extent the US has failed in getting its regional partners to take sides,” he said.   Energy-rich Gulf states have benefited from the rise in prices brought by the war in Ukraine, which has added tens of billions of dollars to their coffers. All six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, registered budget surpluses in 2022 for the first time in eight years. Saudi Arabia’s alliance with Russia in the OPEC oil cartel has also allowed it to have better control over global crude prices, in defiance of the US.   In the UAE, the real estate market in Dubai boomed as Russians flocked into the regional business hub, buying property and starting businesses.     Russians also became Turkey’s top foreign buyers of real estate last year, according to the Turkish news outlet Daily Sabah, citing data by the Turkish Statistical Institute. Strategic ambiguity “So far, it is very clear to them (Middle East states) a year after the isolation of Russia that picking sides would not be in their interest and so they still very much refuse to do so,” said Cinzia Bianco, a research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.   Most Gulf states have remained ambiguous and “cherish that strategic ambiguity,” she said at an event hosted by the Gulf International Forum. They have been “hedging since day one of the war,” she added.   But the US has indicated of late that its patience with its allies is running thin, saying the days of doing business with both Russia and the West are over.   The Biden administration has been ramping up pressure on its Middle East partners to choose between Russia and the West, singling out the UAE and Turkey in particular.    A US Treasury Department delegation visited both countries late last month to warn them against helping Russia evade sanctions, threatening to block their access to G7 markets they fail to comply.   Following the visit, the UAE said that it had discussed measures of combatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism with its US partner, and that “both governments have witnessed significant advances.”   After meeting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Ankara on Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that while his government doesn’t partake in “unilateral sanctions,” it will not allow US and European sanctions to be violated via Turkey.    On Tuesday, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo acknowledged that Russia’s economic data “appears to be better than many expected early in the conflict,” but pledged to double down on efforts to get other states to comply with sanctions.

REUTERS/Carlos BarriaCarlos Barria/ReutersWhy Biden's key Mideast allies aren't condemning Russia's Ukraine invasion “We will force those that fail to implement our sanctions and export controls to choose between their economic ties with our coalition of countries – representing more than half of the world’s GDP – or providing material support to Russia, an economy that is becoming more isolated every day,” he said.    Mohammed Baharoon, director of the Dubai Public Policy Research Center, known as B’huth, said that polarized language of West-versus-Russia is problematic and “dangerous in the long run.”   “There’s a new wall being erected, and I think this is the real problem,” he told CNN, adding that increasing US pressure on Gulf states will not help Russia, the US or the UAE.    “Until now, the position of the UAE, the position of Saudi Arabia and others, has been to find a compromise, to find mediation efforts between the two countries to bring peace,” he said.   Ulrichsen of Rice University said that the UAE is likely watching American language on sanctions evasion closely in case it materializes into action.   At the defense show in Abu Dhabi, the Russian stall was busy, with visitors in traditional Arab clothing seen taking interest in what the Russian arms industry had to offer. CNN approached delegations from three different Russian firms, as well as an organizer of the Russian pavilion, but all refused to speak.   Rosoboronexport, a firm that makes drones and missiles, however, said in a press release last week that it is “busy working out proposals for the forms of partnership that could be of immediate interest to Middle East nations.”   “Middle East countries are Russia’s traditional and important partners,” its director general, Alexander Mikheev, was cited as saying.   The ECFR’s Bianco, however, cast doubt over Middle Eastern interest in Russian weapons.    “It has become clear in several (Gulf) capitals that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed the lack of quality in the performance of Russian weapons, and the low levels of the Russian defense industry,” she said, adding that Gulf states would now be even more reliant on NATO countries for defense procurement.   This story has been updated. A previous version of the story incorrectly stated that Russian arms manufacturers were not on the list of exhibitors.Turkey-Syria earthquake Two weeks after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake devastated parts of Turkey and Syria, a 6.3 magnitude aftershock struck Turkey’s southern Hatay province, near the Syrian border, on Monday.    The epicenter was in the Defne district, according to the Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM. Ninety aftershocks followed, the largest of which was recorded at 5.8. At least six people were killed and hundreds left injured.   The death toll in Syria and Turkey from the February 6 quake stands at 48,151 as of Tuesday.   Here’s the latest:   Turkey launched a temporary economic relief plan and banned layoffs in the ten provinces hit by the earthquake in an effort to protect workers and businesses from the impacts of the disaster, officials said on Wednesday. Workplaces that are “collapsed, urgently need to be demolished, (or are) severely or moderately damaged” would receive support to partially cover workers’ wages. Almost 900,000 people are living in tents and containers in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday. Almost 140,000 buildings have collapsed, should be demolished immediately or are heavily damaged, Erdogan said, adding that 115,000 people have been injured in the country. There are 213 unidentified children in Turkey following the earthquake, according to Turkey’s Family and Social Service Ministry. A total of 1,858 unaccompanied children who were removed from the rubble were registered. Out of those, 1,645 children were identified.  The digest Iranian foundation offers land to Salman Rushdie’s attacker  An Iranian foundation has praised the man who attacked novelist Salman Rushdie last year, leaving him severely injured, and said it will reward him with 1,000 square meters of agricultural land, Reuters cited Iran’s state TV as saying through its Telegram channel on Tuesday. “We sincerely thank the brave action of the young American who made Muslims happy by blinding one of Rushdie’s eyes and disabling one of his hands,” said Mohammad Esmail Zarei, secretary of the Foundation to Implement Imam Khomeini’s Fatwas.   Background: Rushdie, 75, lost an eye and the use of one hand following the assault by a 24-year-old Muslim American from New Jersey on the stage of a literary event held in New York in August. The attack came 33 years after Ayatollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader, issued a fatwa (edict) calling on Muslims to assassinate Rushdie a few months after “The Satanic Verses” was published. Some Muslims saw passages in the novel as blasphemous. Why it matters: Iran’s position on the fatwa has fluctuated over the years. While the pro-reform government of President Mohammad Khatami distanced itself from it in the late 1990s, the multimillion-dollar bounty hanging over Rushdie’s head kept growing and the fatwa was never lifted. In 2019, Khomeini’s successor, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the fatwa was “irrevocable.” UN Security Council issues statement expressing ‘concern’ about Israeli settlements The United Nations Security Council issued a presidential statement on Monday expressing “concern and dismay” with the February 12 decision by Israel to legalize nine settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank. The statement avoided the language of a UAE-led draft resolution that would have reportedly called for the ceasing of settlement activity in the West Bank.    Background: A Security Council presidential statement requires consensus from its 15 members. A resolution calling for an Israeli settlement freeze would have needed nine yes votes and no vetoes from the five permanent members. It risked getting rejected by the US, which often strikes down resolutions critical of Israel. Outposts are existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank that have been set up without Israeli government approval. Why it matters: Security Council resolutions are binding, while presidential statements aren’t. The UAE decided to abandon the resolution in favor of a presidential statement “due to the positive outcome of the talks between the US and Palestine,” a diplomat told CNN earlier.  Ten Palestinians killed in rare Israeli daylight operation in West BankAt least 10 Palestinians, including two Islamic Jihad commanders, were killed Wednesday in a major Israeli military operation in the West Bank that also left more than 100 injured, Palestinian officials said. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said those killed included a man who was 61 and another who was 72. The ministry added that 104 Palestinians were injured “with live ammunition… six of them in critical condition.” Israeli authorities said the military was targeting three suspects “planning attacks in the immediate future.”    Background: Israeli raids in the West Bank usually occur overnight. The last time the military conducted a daylight operation, it said it did so because of an immediate threat. Israel Army Radio reported that the raid was to stop an “imminent attack.” Why it matters: Tensions between Palestinians and Israelis have been boiling in recent weeks. The operation brings the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces this year to 61. That figure includes people shot as they attacked Israelis, militants targeted in raids, people who clashed with Israeli forces during raids, and bystanders, CNN records show. Eleven Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks this year: seven in a shooting near a synagogue, three in a car ramming attack, and a border police officer who was stabbed by a teenager and then shot by friendly fire from a civilian security guard.

Around the region Photo-Illustration:CNN/Getty ImagesThe Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.   Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after its capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.   “The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.   “Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”   While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.   “There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

It also comes on the heels of a highly secretive and surprise visit to Kyiv by President Joe Biden, which aimed to send a stark message about the strength of the two nations’ alliance to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Indeed, Austin echoed a common sentiment among other American officials, including Biden, to CNN, reiterating that the US will stick with Ukraine for as long as it takes.   “As long as Ukraine continues to conduct operations and continues to work to take back its sovereign territory, we’ll be there with them,” he said, adding that “the international community will be with Ukraine once the fighting stops.”  A mural depicting mercenaries of Russia's Wagner Group that reads: ""Wagner Group - Russian knights"" vandalized with paint on a wall in Belgrade, Serbia, Friday, Jan. 13, 2023.Darko Vojinovic/APRussian warlord's feud with Putin's generals explodes into the open with gruesome PR campaignThe US and its allies have provided billions of dollars’ worth of ammunition, weapons systems, and training to the Ukrainians since the war began one year ago – $29.8 billion of that coming from the US alone since the beginning of Russia’s invasion. Recently that has included significant items like the Patriot missile system and M1 Abrams tanks, though both require substantial training and maintenance capabilities.  Those additional capabilities will make all the difference, Austin said.  “I think the things that we’re doing, the capability that we’re providing – again, capability, not just a platform – the capabilities that we’re providing I think will enable the Ukrainians begin to change the dynamics on the battlefield,” he said. “And so rather than having a stalemate, what you’ll probably see is Ukrainians shaping this fight so they can create opportunities for themselves and exploit those opportunities going forward.”   Austin said in Brussels last week that countries involved in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group have been “working hard” to ensure Ukraine has the capability it needs to create “the effects on the battlefield they want to create,” particularly in a renewed offensive he expects Ukraine to launch this spring.

Austin said he had not yet seen China do so, but that China “hasn’t taken that off the table for sure.”  “I’ve engaged my counterpart early on and told him that this would be a very bad mistake if China were to do this. It would complicate things,” he said.  Ultimately, the war will most likely “end with some sort of negotiation,” Austin told CNN.  In recent months, the prospect of negotiations taking place have seemed unlikely as Russia has continued to bombard Ukrainian infrastructure and population centers.  “[W]hat the Ukrainians are interested in is getting the Russians out of their sovereign territory,” he said. “And I think that’s probably going to be their going-in point, but I’ll let the Ukrainians speak for themselves.”    CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed reporting.

Chinese apps remove ChatGPT as global AI race heats up    			By Jessie Yeung and Wayne Chang, CNN		  Published  3:41 AM EST, Thu February 23, 2023    Link Copied!   The ChatGPT app displayed on a screen on February 3, 2023.Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      Several popular Chinese apps have removed access to ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot that has taken the world by storm even as major Chinese tech companies race to develop their own equivalent.  ChatGPT, developed by the American research lab OpenAI, is not officially available in China, but several apps on the Chinese social media platform WeChat had previously allowed access to the chatbot without the use of a VPN or foreign mobile number.  Those doors now appear shut. Earlier this week, the apps ChatGPTRobot and AIGC Chat Robot said their programs had been suspended due to “violation of relevant laws and regulations,” without specifying which laws.  Two other apps, ChatgptAiAi and Chat AI Conversation, said their ChatGPT services went offline due to “relevant business changes” and policy changes.   The app Shenlan BL was even more vague, citing “various reasons” for the shutdown.  Students study in the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania Mark Makela/Getty Images/FILEChatGPT passes exams from law and business schoolsThough it’s unclear what prompted these closures, there are other signs China may be souring on ChatGPT. On Monday, state-run media released a video claiming the chatbot could be used by US authorities to “spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion,” pointing to its responses regarding Xinjiang as supposed evidence of bias.  When prompted on Xinjiang, ChatGPT describes the Chinese government’s alleged human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the far western region, including mass detentions and forced labor. Beijing has repeatedly denied these accusations, claiming detention camps are “vocational education and training centers” that have since been dismantled.  Other recent state media articles have voiced criticism and skepticism toward ChatGPT, with China Daily declaring that its rise highlights the need for “strict regulations.”  Several Chinese tech companies saw their shares drop on Thursday after news spread that WeChat apps had removed ChatGPT services. Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology, which develops and produces AI data products, closed 8.4% lower.   Meanwhile, Hanwang Technology and Beijing Deep Glint Technology, both developers of AI products and services, closed 10% and 5.5% lower respectively.Global AI raceChatGPT burst onto the scene in December, quickly going viral thanks to its ability to provide lengthy, thorough — though sometimes inaccurate — responses to questions and prompts.   Since its release, the tool has been used to write articles for at least one news publication, drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists and even passed graduate-level law and business exams (albeit with low marks).  It has also prompted alarm about its unknown long-term consequences, such as its impact on education and students’ ability to cheat on assignments.  Despite these concerns, the success of ChatGPT has spurred a global AI race.Microsoft plans to invest billions in the San Francisco-based OpenAI and unveiled its AI-powered Bing chatbot last week, though it made headlines for veering into darker, sometimes disturbing conversation. Earlier this month, Google announced it will soon roll out Bard, its own answer to ChatGPT.  Ramin Talaie/Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty ImagesGoogle and Microsoft's AI arms race could have 'unintended consequences,' an AI ethicist warnsChina’s government has previously sought to restrict major Western websites and apps, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, leading to accusations from some of digital protectionism.In the absence of foreign competition within the domestic market, Chinese tech companies have since grown into major international players — many of which are now revving their gears with an eye toward AI.  In early February, Chinese behemoth Alibaba said it was testing its own ChatGPT-style tool, though it didn’t provide details on when it would launch.   A team at China’s Fudan University developed their own version called MOSS, which instantly went viral, causing the platform to crash this week due to too many users.  And on Wednesday, tech giant Baidu said its AI chatbot ERNIE Bot, slated for a March release, will be used across various platforms such as its search engine, voice assistant for smart devices and even its autonomous driving technology.  The rollout will “create a new entry point for the next-generation internet,” Baidu CEO Robin Li said in an earnings call, adding that the company expects “more and more business owners and entrepreneurs to build their own models and applications on our AI Cloud.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Camp toy store pleads for help after Silicon Valley Bank collapse    Mar 11, 2023  Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

Commission staff have until March 15 to delete the short-form video app, owned by China’s ByteDance, from work devices and any personal devices that use Commission apps and services.  Based in Brussels, the European Commission is the executive arm of the European Union, responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation and implementing the EU budget. It employs around 32,000 permanent and contract workers.  “This measure aims to protect the Commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyberattacks against the corporate environment of the Commission,” the Commission said in a statement Thursday.   Adobe StockTikTok is planning two more data centers in Europe European Commission spokesperson Sonya Gospodinova told reporters that the ban was “temporary” and “under constant review and possible reassessment.”  A second spokesperson, Eric Mamer, added: “But we’re not going to say here what is necessary or not in order for the suspension to be lifted.”  The measure piles further pressure on TikTok, already banned from US federal government devices and from official devices in some US states due to fears that the app’s user data could wind up in the hands of the Chinese government.   Previously, TikTok has disclosed to European users that China-based employees may access EU users’ data.   But on Thursday the company pushed back against the ban, calling it “misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions.”   In a statement shared with CNN, a spokesperson said TikTok had contacted the Commission to “set the record straight and explain how we protect the data of the 125 million people across the EU who come to TikTok every month.”  “We’re continuing to enhance our approach to data security, including by establishing three data centers in Europe to store user data locally; further reducing employee access to data; and minimizing data flows outside of Europe,” the spokesperson added.  The company has previously said it is working on a program to safeguard US user data in response to policymakers’ concerns.

The aim: to deal an economic blow so severe that Putin would reconsider his brutal war.  Russia’s economy did weaken as a result. But it also showed surprising resilience. As demand for Russian oil fell in Europe, Moscow redirected its barrels to Asia. The country’s central bank staved off a currency crisis with aggressive capital controls and interest rate hikes. Military expenditure supported the industrial sector, while the scramble to replace Western equipment and technology lifted investment.  “The Russian economy and system of government have turned out to be much stronger than the West believed,” Putin said in a speech to Russia’s parliament Tuesday.   Yet cracks are starting to show and they will widen over the next 12 months. The European Union — which spent more than $100 billion on Russian fossil fuels in 2021 — has made huge strides in phasing out purchases. The bloc, which dramatically reduced its dependence on Russian natural gas last year, officially banned most imports of Russian crude oil by sea in December. It enacted a similar block on refined oil products this month.  Those measures are already straining Russia’s finances as it struggles to find replacement customers willing to pay high prices. The government reported a budget deficit of about 1,761 billion rubles ($23.5 billion) for January. Expenditure jumped 59% year-over-year, while revenue plunged 35%. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced that Russia would cut oil production by about 5% starting in March.  “The era of windfall profits from the oil and gas market for Russia is over,” Janis Kluge, an expert on Russia’s economy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told CNN.

Alexey Malgavko/ReutersMeanwhile, the ruble has slumped to its weakest level against the US dollar since last April. The currency’s weakness has contributed to high inflation. And most businesses say they can’t conceive of growing right now given high levels of economic uncertainty, according to a recent survey by a Russian think tank.  These dynamics place the country’s economy on a trajectory of decline. And they will force Putin to choose between ramping up military spending and investing in social goods like housing and education — a decision that could have consequences both for the war and the Russian public’s support of it.  “This year could really be the key test,” said Timothy Ash, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a think tank.Holding upIn a bid to bring Russia to heel for its aggression, Western countries have used their sway over the global financial system, unveiling more than 11,300 sanctions since the invasion and freezing some $300 billion of the country’s foreign reserves. At the same time, more than 1,000 companies, ranging from BP    (BP) to McDonald’s    (MCD) and Starbucks    (SBUX), have exited or curtailed operations in the country, citing opposition to the war and new logistical challenges.  Russia’s economic output duly contracted by 2.1% last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the government. But the hit was more limited than forecasters initially expected. When sanctions were first imposed, some economists predicted a contraction of 10% or 15%.  One reason for Russia’s unexpected pluck was its push toward self-sufficiency following Putin’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Through a policy known as “Fortress Russia,” the government boosted domestic food production and policymakers forced banks to build up their reserves. That created a degree of “durability,” said Ash at Chatham House.   The swift intervention of Russia’s central bank, which jacked up interest rates to 20% after the invasion and implemented currency controls to buttress the ruble, was also a stabilizing force. So was the need for factories to increase production of military goods and replace items that had been imported from the West.  But the greatest support came from high energy prices and the world’s continued thirst for oil and other commodities.

Here's howRussia, the world’s second-largest exporter of crude, was able to send barrels that would have gone to Europe to countries like China and India. The European Union, which imported an average of 3.3 million barrels of Russian crude and oil products per day in 2021, was also still buying 2.3 million barrels per day as of November, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).  “It’s a question of natural resources,” Sergey Aleksashenko, Russia’s former deputy minister of finance, said at an event last month hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank. That meant the economy experienced a decline, but “not a collapse,” he added.Russia’s oil problemIn fact, Russia’s average monthly oil export revenues rose by 24% last year to $18.1 billion, according to the IEA. Yet a repeat performance is unlikely, presaging increasingly tough decisions for Putin.  The price of a barrel of Urals crude, Russia’s main blend, fell to an average of $49.50 in January after Europe’s oil embargo — as well as a Group of Seven price cap — took effect. By comparison, the global benchmark stood around $82. That suggests that customers like India and China, seeing a smaller pool of interested buyers, are negotiating greater discounts. Russia’s 2023 budget is based on a Urals price of more than $70 per barrel.  Finding new buyers for processed oil products, which are also subject to new embargoes and price caps, won’t be easy either. China and India have their own network of refineries and prefer to buy crude, noted Ben McWilliams, an energy consultant at Bruegel.   Meanwhile, gas exports to Europe have plunged since Russia shut its Nord Stream 1 pipeline.

As it plans to maximize defense spending, lower revenues inevitably mean trade-offs. Spending plans for 2023 finalized in December involved a decrease in expenditure on housing and health care, as well as a category that includes public infrastructure.  “Whatever energy resources are obtained, they’ll be spent on military needs,” said Gulnaz Sharafutdinova, acting director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London.On the declineThe International Monetary Fund still expects Russia’s economy to expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. Yet any outlook is contingent on what happens in Ukraine.  “Whether the economy shrinks or expands in 2023 will be determined by developments in the war,” Tatiana Orlova, an economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Shortages of workers tied to military conscription and emigration pose a key risk, she noted.  The impact of Western sanctions is poised to develop into a crisis over time. Bloomberg Economics estimates that Putin’s war in Ukraine will slash $190 billion off Russia’s gross domestic product by 2026 compared with the country’s prewar path.  Sectors that rely on imports have been particularly vulnerable. Domestic car makers such as Avtovaz, which manufactures the iconic Ladas, have struggled with shortages of key components and materials.

Getty ImagesRussia’s auto industry was already weakened after companies such as Volkswagen    (VLKAF), Renault    (RNLSY), Ford    (F) and Nissan    (NSANF) halted production and began to sell their local assets last year. Chinese firms have stepped up their presence, part of a broader trend. Even so, sales of new cars dropped 63% year-over-year in January, according to the Association of European Businesses.   Across sectors, firms are struggling to plan for the future. A survey of more than 1,000 Russian businesses by the Stolypin Institute of Economic Growth in November found that almost half plan to maintain production over the next one to two years and aren’t thinking about growth. The group said this contributed to a high risk of “long-term stagnation of the Russian economy.”  Given Putin’s ideological commitment to subsuming Ukraine, he’s unlikely to back down, according to Sharafutdinova at King’s College London. But his war chest “is likely, inevitably, to diminish,” she added.   Prioritizing military spending will also come at a social cost, with a “slow and creeping” erosion of living standards, she added.  “In normal times, we might have said that the population would protest against that,” Sharafutdinova said. “But of course, these are not normal times.”  — Clare Sebastian and Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.

Former National Security Adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster attends the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Global Security Challenges and Strategy in Washington on Tuesday, March 2, 2021. Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty ImagesCNN      The House select committee on China will feature four high-profile witnesses during its first hearing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET, including former President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and top China expert and former deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, sources familiar with the hearing told CNN.   This is the first primetime hearing that any GOP-led committee has held since Republicans took over the House majority in January. The panel’s top Republican, Chairman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, is hoping to make a splash with his witness list, which is aimed at proving his panel’s commitment to leading a serious, bipartisan investigation that could result in substantial legislative action, the sources said.   Other witnesses include Tong Yi, former secretary to one of China’s leading dissidents and current human rights activist, Wei Jingsheng, and Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.  The witnesses will help the committee lay out what they view are the specific threats China poses as a global competitor, as well as the panel’s top priorities on how to counter Beijing’s aggression.   McMaster and Pottinger are significant witnesses for the committee to showcase. They are widely respected on both sides of the aisle and played key roles in how the Trump administration formulated and carried out its agenda toward China.   Pottinger, in particular, worked for Trump from the start of his administration until resigning in the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. He testified publicly last year before the House select committee on the January 6 attack, earning him a nod of approval from the left.   “Our national security was harmed in a different way by the sixth of January and that is, I think it emboldened our enemies by helping give them ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn’t work, that the United States is in decline,” Pottinger said at the hearing. “China, the Putin regime in Russia, Tehran, they’re fond of pushing those kinds of narratives – and by the way, they’re wrong.”   Meanwhile, Tong will be a crucial witness who can speak personally to one of the committee’s top priorities – highlighting China’s human rights abuses and why the US must do more to curb its global influence. Tong was arrested and imprisoned for her involvement with Jingsheng and the democracy movement in 1993, and was later released in 1996 before going into exile in the US.   Paul is expected to outline the reasoning for reducing Beijing’s role in the US economy and preventing American companies from ending up in the hands of Chinese state-owned firms and investors. He’s also been a leading voice on increasing domestic manufacturing, and can speak to why the panel believes the US must stop China’s leverage at every angle.   Tuesday’s hearing is the committee’s first test to showcase what the panel is setting out to do: leading serious investigations in a bipartisan way that can get the backing of the majority of the public.    Both Gallagher and Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the committee’s highest ranking Democrat, have publicly touted the panel’s efforts to remain bipartisan in tone and practice, and both have pointed to the types of members on the panel as proof that their work will be a departure from the highly politicized investigations other top committees are conducting.   “We’re not going to turn this into a partisan, bomb-throwing committee,” Gallagher recently told CNN. “Now, there may be meaningful disagreement on the issues. There are plenty of areas where Democrats and Republicans disagree on China, but overall, I think everyone’s trying to row in the same direction.”   That commitment to bipartisanship, however, was recently tested by the controversial approach the Biden administration took in handling the Chinese spy balloon that recently flew over the US. How the committee addresses that approach will be a key sign of whether they can honor their vow to remain civil and work together.    McMaster and Pottinger will likely take questions on Tuesday about what the Trump administration knew regarding the transiting of three suspected Chinese spy balloons over the continental US during Trump’s time in office. Committee aides told CNN to watch the line of questioning from different members as a sign of whether the panel can remain unified on the public stage. Taiwan center stage While Tuesday’s hearing is expected to largely focus on China’s human rights abuses, one of the most pressing issues the committee will ultimately delve into is how the US should defend Taiwan against growing Chinese aggression in the region.   The hearing comes after a congressional delegation, led by select committee member Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, traveled to Taiwan where they met with top officials to discuss the threats posed by China.   Khanna worked extremely hard to ensure that this trip was not seen as overly provocative to China, focusing on the economic relationship and publicly stating his interest in visiting China as well, according to an aide, who noted that it was not cancelled in the wake of the Chinese spy balloon incident because he believed it would send the wrong message.   The congressman met with Morris Chang, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, who, according to the aide, typically does not meet with delegations, but wanted to meet with Khanna because of his Silicon Valley ties and the role as a co-author of the CHIPS and Science Act.   Addressing challenges posed by China’s role in the semiconductor supply chain is a top priority for the China select committee and has bipartisan support, according to sources familiar with the matter.   Khanna told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday that he hopes the committee will have the opportunity to hear directly from top officials like CIA Director Bill Burns and discuss strategies for avoiding conflict with China at a time of potentially increasing tensions.   “The committee is working in a way that is consistent with American foreign policy,” he said, pointing to the work of former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter that has “stood the test of time for almost 50 years and avoided conflict in the straights.”   “It would behoove us to understand the rationale behind that policy, the delicate balance the US has managed to strike,” Khanna added, noting it would be helpful for the panel to address those topics, including the administration’s policy related to Taiwan, with Burns and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in particular.  Senior US national security officials, including Burns, have increasingly warned that the Chinese military has been ordered by President Xi Jinping to prepare for a potential invasion of Taiwan – a move that would dramatically escalate tensions and increase the risk of conflict with the US.“We clearly see indications of Xi instructing his military to be ready” for an invasion later in this decade, Burns said at the Munich Security Conference, referring to Taiwan.   While “that doesn’t mean that an invasion is going to occur,” it underscores how the “risks increase the farther you get into this decade and beyond,” he added.

Rscue vehicles work at the site of a collapsed coal mine in Alxa League, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.Chine Nouvelle/SIPA/ShutterstockCNN      Search and rescue operations continued in northern China Thursday, after a collapsed coal mine left at least five dead and dozens trapped.   Chinese state media reported that six were injured and 48 people remain missing as of Thursday evening.   The incident took place Wednesday in Alxa League in Inner Mongolia when a 180-meter (590-foot) tall slope gave way above the open-pit mine, according to state broadcaster CCTV.  The rescue operation was halted overnight due to a massive landslide near the site Wednesday evening, with efforts still blocked as of early Thursday morning – though state media reported in the afternoon that operations were “ongoing.”  More than 470 rescue workers have been working at the scene, alongside 40 medical workers, team leader Wei Zhiguo told CCTV from the scene. An additional 200-member team has also been mobilized, he said.  Firefighters, rescue dogs and trucks have also been mobilized from across the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.  “I had just started work at 1:15 in the afternoon when I realised that rocks were falling from the mountain,” one hospitalized miner told CCTV on Thursday, as quoted by Reuters.  “I saw that the situation was getting more and more serious, and an evacuation was organized, but it was too late, the mountain just collapsed.”  Rescue vehicles near the site of the collapsed coal mine.

Many people with constipation use one of two major types of laxative.JuanCi Studio/Adobe StockCNN      Researchers say they’ve found a possible link between regular laxative use and a person’s risk of dementia, but experts note that the research is very early and should be interpreted with caution.  According to the researchers, from medical institutions across China as well as the University of Cambridge and Harvard Medical School, constipation affects about 20% of the general population and about 70% of people in nursing homes, and most people with constipation are treated with one of two versions of over-the-counter laxatives.  ShutterstockNot just prunes: foods to help you get regularThe study, published Wednesday in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal, Neurology, suggests that a potential dementia link is strongest with osmotic laxatives, which draw water into stool to make it softer and easier to pass. The other major kind, stimulant laxatives, increases muscle contractions along the stool mass.The study included about 10 years of self-reported data from 476,219 adults ages 40 and 69 in the UK. At the start, the study authors identified the participants’ health status and lifestyle factors, including their exposure to over-the-counter laxatives. About 3.6% of the participants reported using laxatives most days of the week for the previous four weeks.  These regular users were more likely to be women, have less education, have a chronic illness, and regularly take anticholinergic and opioid drugs. “The prevalence of stroke, high blood pressure, depression, poor overall self-health rating, and the uptake of calcium channel blockers, statins, and steroid drugs were higher in regular than non-regular users,” the study says.  Close up man holding glass with alcohol in hand on wooden table at home, drinking whiskey alone, customer sitting at bar counter, problem with alcoholic beverages conceptfizkes/Adobe StockStudy presents unexpected — and complicated — findings on link between alcohol and dementiaThe researchers found that 2,187 participants had a diagnosis of all-cause dementia, which includes Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, by the end of the study period.  “Regular use of laxatives was associated with a higher risk of all-cause dementia, particularly in those who used multiple laxative types or osmotic laxative,” they wrote in the study.  Dementia was diagnosed in 1.3% of the participants who regularly used laxatives and 0.4% of those who didn’t report regular laxative use.  Dr. Richard Isaacson, a preventative neurologist at the institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases of Florida, says the findings are interesting but only speculative.  “Further study is absolutely warranted to make a definitive impact on clinical practice,” said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study.  The researchers offered one explanation for the finding, which begins with the composition of the microbiome, the trillions of microorganisms that live in the gut.  Old elderly black man.

Office syndrome.tampatra/Adobe StockDementia risk rises if you live with chronic pain, study saysThey said that an osmotic laxative has a lasting impact on the microbiome and could affect the production of neurotransmitters needed for normal cognitive function. An osmotic laxative may also increase the production of intestinal toxins, they wrote.  Laxatives may also disrupt the epithelial barrier, which regulates nutrient absorption and helps deliver necessary substances to the central nervous system.  The study’s limitations include that patient data was self-reported and could have been inaccurately noted, and that there was limited information on possible confounders like fiber intake and severity of constipation.  Dr. Ali Rezaie, director of the GI Motility Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said that he’s skeptical of the findings and that the study lacks one main component needed to accurately draw an association between regular laxative use and dementia: enough data.  “Laxatives do change the microbiome, but we don’t have data to suggest that those changes caused by the laxatives are the same changes that we see in the study of dementia,” said Rezaie, who was not involved in the research. “That is a big leap that will take decades of studying to figure out.”  The white chocolate colonoscopy prep barColonaryConceptsRIP for the dreaded colonoscopy drink? He says that the study period was not long enough to draw concrete evidence and that the foundational participant data does not accurately represent what he sees in his practice.  The study equates the amount of participants who used laxatives regularly to the number who experienced constipation, but the two groups may not always overlap.  “How come the prevalence of constipation in their study was only 3%?” he asked. “This simply tells me that they did not pick up all of the constipation patients, they only picked up patients who mentioned over-the-counter laxatives they were taking regularly. … It’s very unusual to find only 3% of a population constipated.”  Isaacson also noted the lack of participant data, especially related to the diversity of participants.  “From a health equity perspective, it’s important to say that the specific study population was 90% White,” he said. “Broader conclusions based on a more diverse population really have to be withheld.”Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter   Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  Isaacson and Rezaie came to a similar conclusion: More research is needed, and the potential link isn’t strong enough to change medical practice.  “We don’t really want to be telling people it’s time to stop their laxative because you’re going to have dementia. That is the wrong message,” Isaacson said.  Rezaie said he worries that his patients may be overly concerned about the possibility of dementia and avoid the laxatives needed for certain procedures.  “This may even affect our colon cancer screening,” he said.

Members of the Chinese navy stand on the deck of a navy ship at a military port on May 18, 2022, in Zhoushan, China.VCG/Getty Images/FILECNN      China’s navy has significant advantages over its US rival, including a bigger fleet and greater shipbuilding capacity, as Beijing seeks to project its power across the oceans, the head of the United States Navy said Tuesday.  Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said China “consistently attempts to violate the maritime sovereignty and economic well-being of other nations including our allies in the South China Sea and elsewhere.”  “They got a larger fleet now so they’re deploying that fleet globally,” he said, adding that Washington must upgrade the US fleet in response.  “We do need a larger Navy, we do need more ships in the future, more modern ships in the future, in particular that can meet that threat,” he said.  Video Ad FeedbackSatellite images of mockup US Navy ships in China spark concern (November 2021)    00:34   - Source:CNNChina’s People’s Liberation Army Navy could be fielding up to 400 ships in the coming years, the Navy secretary said – up from about 340 now.   Meanwhile, the US fleet sits at under 300 ships.   According to the US Navy’s Navigation Plan 2022 released last summer, the Pentagon’s goal is to have 350 manned ships by 2045 – still well short of the projection for China’s fleet.  Before that target is met, however, the US fleet is expected to shrink as older vessels are retired, according to a November report from the US Congressional Budget Office.

As with fleet size, it’s about numbers.  “They have 13 shipyards, in some cases their shipyard has more capacity – one shipyard has more capacity than all of our shipyards combined. That presents a real threat,” he claimed.  Del Toro did not give a breakdown of those shipyards, but Chinese and Western reports say China has six major and two smaller shipyards building naval vessels.  In the US, seven shipyards produce large and deep draft ships for the US Navy and Coast Guard, according to an October report from Brent Sadler at the Center for National Defense.  But no matter the number of shipyards, they need workers, and Del Toro says China has a numerical advantage there, largely because it is free of the restrictions, regulations and economic pressures that affect labor in the US.  Video Ad FeedbackAnalysts warn of intensifying arms race across Asia (November, 2021)    03:55   - Source:CNNOne big US problem is finding skilled labor, he said.  “[W]hen you have unemployment at less than 4%, it makes it a real challenge whether you’re trying to find workers for a restaurant or you’re trying to find workers for a shipyard,” the Navy leader said.  He also said China can do things the US can’t.  “They’re a communist country, they don’t have rules by which they abide by,” he said.  “They use slave labor in building their ships, right – that’s not the way we should do business ever, but that’s what we’re up against so it does present a significant advantage,” he claimed.  CNN has reached out to China’s Foreign Ministry for reaction to Del Toro’s allegations.

US Navy/Reuters/FILE    US advantagesDel Toro did not supply specifics to support the slave labor allegation, and analysts expressed doubt that Beijing would resort to such a tactic.  “China has a very large pool of available manpower and it wouldn’t really make sense to use slave labor in a high-tech sector vital to their national security,” said Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  Herzinger said comments like that from the Navy chief are indicative of a pattern where US attention is put in the wrong place – to the detriment of US abilities.  “This seems unfortunately common, that Navy leadership throws stones at real or imagined faults in Chinese shipbuilding rather than reckoning with US failures over two decades to conceptualize, design and build ships for its own navy,” Herzinger said.

And Del Toro said Tuesday that the US retains one big advantage over China – “our people.”  “In many ways our shipbuilders are better shipbuilders, that’s why we have a more modern, more capable, more lethal Navy than they do,” he said.  US military personnel are better on their feet, too, Del Toro contended.  “They script their people to fight, we actually train our people to think,” he said.  “There’s a fundamental difference in how we train our Marines and our sailors and our soldiers and our airmen and our Space Force in this country that gives us an inherent advantage over anything the Chinese can put up.”  Video Ad FeedbackThis could be the next battlefield in modern warfare    02:22   - Source:CNN  CNN’s Nectar Gan contributed to this report.

Getty ImagesCNN      The Republican rift over the United States’ support for Ukraine was on vivid display this week, as 2024 presidential hopefuls staked out opposing positions on whether President Joe Biden’s administration has done too much or too little to help the country a year into Russia’s invasion.  The divide over the US role in Ukraine is one of the opening fault lines of a GOP race that is only beginning to take shape – and one that could become a heated topic when Republican primary debates begin in the coming months.   What GOP presidential candidates, and those taking steps toward entering the race, broadly agree on is that Biden has mishandled the situation.   But those hopefuls are split into two camps: Isolationists, particularly former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who believe the United States is too involved in supporting Ukraine’s efforts to fend off the Russian invasion; and hawks, including several former Trump administration officials, who argue for an even more aggressive posture toward Russia. Both sides are warning that if their positions aren’t heeded, a world war could follow.   Trump and DeSantis both accused Biden of provoking unnecessary clashes with global powers by traveling to Ukraine on Monday.   Meanwhile, Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador who last week became the second major candidate to declare her candidacy, took the opposite position in stops in New Hampshire and Iowa, arguing for a more forceful US role.   “It’s more than just about Ukraine. This is a war about freedom. And it’s a war we have to win,” the former South Carolina governor said Monday night in Urbandale, Iowa.   Trump this week has repeatedly lambasted Biden for his Kyiv trip.  “World War III has never been closer than it is right now,” Trump said Tuesday in a video in which he pledged to “clean house of all of the warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.”   Trump also sent supporters a fundraising email claiming Biden is defending other countries’ borders – a clear reference to Ukraine – but putting Americans “dead last.”   And on his social media network, Truth Social, Trump said: “If you watch and understand the moves being made by Biden on Ukraine, he is systematically, but perhaps unknowingly, pushing us into what could soon be WORLD WAR III.”  But Haley is among the latter group, telling voters in Iowa that stopping Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine is necessary to prevent “world war.”   She, too, faulted Biden – but said the president has been too “slow to the take” and that he emboldened Putin with the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan. She said the United States should continue supplying Ukraine with military equipment and ammunition.   “If we win this fight for freedom it will send a signal to every enemy we have. If we lose this fight for freedom, Russia has said Poland and the Baltics are next and then we’ve got a world war,” she said.   Other prominent Republicans have similarly argued for a forceful US role in Ukraine.  Former Vice President Mike Pence, who has said he is considering a 2024 run, said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday that the US has “got to stay in the fight” in backing Ukraine against Russia’s invasion.  “We are involved in a proxy war against the Soviet Union, the Ukrainians are fighting it. And I really believe that it is essential that we see it through. We demand our European allies do more than their share because it is their front yard. But I think it is absolutely essential that after a slow start in providing support to the Ukrainian military by the Biden administration, we’re now providing that support. But let’s get them what they need, the tanks, let’s get them the F-16s and support them as they finish this fight,” Pence said.  Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is also considering a 2024 presidential bid, said Tuesday that Biden’s trip was “a great moment for America.”   “We need to applaud this. This is a good moment for our country, and in those that respect, freedom and sovereignty, and those that are fighting against oppression,” the former two-term Republican governor said Tuesday during an interview on Fox News host Brian Kilmeade’s radio show.  DeSantis – who this week made appearances on Fox News and traveled to New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, delivering what could be a preview of his potential 2024 message – appears to be attempting to out-flank Trump in opposing Biden’s approach to the war.   DeSantis on Monday criticized American aid to Ukraine as an “open-ended blank check” and questioned whether the United States should be engaged in the Russian conflict at all.  “I don’t think it’s in our interest to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the Borderlands or over Crimea,” DeSantis told “Fox & Friends,” referring to Ukrainian territories that Russia has seized through military force.  Asked on the program “what a win looks like” for the United States, DeSantis demurred and instead downplayed Russia’s military actions to date, saying the country was “really wounded” and suffered “tremendous, tremendous loses” without acknowledging the role that US weapons, military intelligence and aid have played in shaping the conflict.   DeSantis insisted Russia is not a threat “on the same level as China” – a remark that is a stark departure from the years he spent in Congress as a hawk on the issue as a member of the House Freedom Caucus, casting former President Barack Obama as weak in his approach to Russia.   “The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all that, and steamrolling, that has not even come close to happening,” DeSantis said Monday. “I think they have shown themselves to be a third-rate military power.”GOP rift over UkraineOne of the earliest clashes of the 2024 race – playing out with only two candidates officially having entered the Republican primary – is taking place against the backdrop of a broader debate within the GOP over the United States’ role in the war in Ukraine and its broader foreign policy obligations.   Biden’s trip to Ukraine on Monday, meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show support for Kyiv nearly a year into Russia’s invasion and announce another $500 million in US assistance, was met with strident criticism from Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump.   Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said Biden’s visit demonstrated an “America last” policy.  “This is incredibly insulting. Today on our President’s Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine’s government and war,” Greene said in a tweet.  Greene was one of 11 House Republicans who co-sponsored a “Ukraine Fatigue” resolution earlier this month. The resolution called for suspending military and financial aid to Ukraine.  Other House Republicans have urged Biden to increase support for Ukraine.   Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, pledged GOP support for Ukraine and NATO and argued for boosting military spending. He also insisted Republicans are committed to global leadership.   “Don’t look at Twitter. Look at the people in power, like me and Speaker Kevin McCarthy,” he said.    South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement he was “very pleased” Biden visited Ukraine.   “This was the right signal to send at the right time,” Graham said.   The debate over Republicans’ approach to the war in Ukraine is being shaped in part by polling that shows GOP voters are less likely than Democratic voters to support the United States playing a major role.   About a year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, recent polling suggests there’s been a slight decline in support for US intervention in the war and a growing sense that the United States is doing too much, particularly among Republicans.   A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that 40% of Americans feel the United States is doing the right amount to help Ukraine, with 30% saying the United States is doing too much and 22% too little.   Republicans are most likely to say that the US is doing too much (47%, compared with 35% among independents and 9% among Democrats), while a majority of Democrats say the effort is about right (56% among Democrats compared with 39% among independents and 30% among Republicans).  An AP-NORC survey conducted in late January found that most Americans feel the United States should have a role in the Russia-Ukraine war at 75%, including 26% who say the United States should have a major role in the conflict. Democrats, at 40%, were more apt than Republicans, at 17%, to say the United States should be playing a major role.   A Fox News poll in late January found that about half of registered voters in the United States think that Ukraine is winning the war against Russia (51% said so, while 34% think Russia is winning and 9% say neither are), and that most want to continue supplying weapons (64%) or money (63%) to Ukraine.  Other Republicans who are considering 2024 runs, including members of Trump’s former administration, have similarly argued that the United States should take a more active role in opposing Russia’s war in Ukraine.   Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Fox News last month that the United States “should be doing everything the Ukrainians are asking us to do.”   He noted that Ukrainian leaders have not asked for direct US military support. “They’ve simply said, provide us the stuff we need. And it is their lives that are at risk,” Pompeo said.   “Helping America means a sovereign nation that is prepared to defend itself from an invasion and an attack where civilians are being killed by Vladimir Putin is in America’s best interest for our economy, for our security,” he said.   Pence has also sought to steer the Republican Party toward a more aggressive posture against Russia, denouncing “Putin apologists.”   He warned conservatives in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in October against being “led astray by the siren song of unprincipled populism that’s unmoored from our oldest traditions and most cherished values.”   “As Russia continues its unconscionable war of aggression to Ukraine, I believe that conservatives must make it clear that Putin must stop and Putin will pay,” he added. “There can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to Putin. There is only room in this movement for champions of freedom.”  This story has been updated with additional reporting.

Starbucks CEO says things have gone sour for young people    			By Danielle Wiener-Bronner  Updated  9:31 AM EST, Wed February 22, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz on company's growing union movement    09:14   - Source:CNN Business    New YorkCNN      Fifteen years ago, Howard Schultz reprised his role as Starbucks CEO, returning to the helm to help put the struggling company back on course. At the time, the coffee chain was flailing, facing growing competition, cooling customer interest and contending with the financial crisis.   Last year he returned once again, as Starbucks was in the midst of a different crisis: A growing wave of unionization among Starbucks employees, many of them young and frustrated by the status quo.  Schultz, who sat down for a far-reaching conversation with CNN’s Poppy Harlow in February, covering the union, relations with China and the US economy, said he didn’t return to Starbucks because of the union efforts. But he did see the labor movement as a sign that things had gone sour at Starbucks, and for young people in general.   “It’s my belief that the efforts of unionization in America are in many ways a manifestation of a much bigger problem,” he told Harlow. “There is a macro issue here that is much, much bigger than Starbucks.”  Howard Schultz sits off stage to listen incoming Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan at the company's investor day in September in Seattle, Washington.Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesThe first Starbucks store voted to unionize in December of 2021, about five months before Schultz became CEO — this time on an interim basis — for the third, and he says final, time. Even before he officially rejoined the company, Schultz was already alarmed by the union push.   In November, a month before the successful vote to unionize, he published an open letter to employees. “No partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks,” he wrote, using the word “partner” to refer to employees, as Starbucks does. “I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now.”  Video Ad FeedbackStarbucks employees at New York store vote to unionize (2021)    02:06   - Source:CNNBusinessUnionized workers are fighting for guaranteed schedules, protecting benefits for part-time workers and more. One priority, they say, is to have Starbucks sign fair election principles which protect workers rights to organize without retaliation.   In the months since returning as CEO, Schultz has doubled down on his opposition to the union. And during his tenure, the battle has intensified and turned ugly.   Union leadership has accused Starbucks of refusing to come to the bargaining table, threatening their benefits and employing union-busting tactics, claims that the company has denied.   Starbucks employee Brian Murray, center, and other employees and supporters react as votes are read during a viewing party for their union election on Thursday, Dec. 9, 2021, in Buffalo, N.Y. Joshua Bessex/APThe union has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against the company, and Starbucks has filed some of its own unfair labor charges against the union, saying that it’s the union that is holding up negotiations.   The NLRB has found, in some cases, that the company illegally threatened and fired workers involved in the union effort. A judge recently ruled that Starbucks must stop firing employees who are involved in the union. Starbucks said the measure was unwarranted, and, relating to the NLRB’s findings, that it endeavors to comply with the law.    And recently, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and the rest of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee asked Schultz to testify in an upcoming hearing on Starbucks’ compliance with labor laws. Schultz declined, and Starbucks announced that its chief public affairs officer AJ Jones II will attend instead.   As of mid-February, the National Labor Relations Board has certified 282 stores that voted to unionize, and 56 that voted against. There are about 9,300 US company-operated Starbucks stores, and a relatively small number have voted to unionize. To Schultz, this means that the vast majority of workers at Starbucks stores are happy with how things are.   The union sees its growth, in spite of Starbucks’ muscular fight against it, as a clear sign of worker interest. “The fact that Starbucks workers are continuing to organize and win shows just how much workers need and desire a union,” Starbucks Workers United said in a statement to CNN.    Over the years, Starbucks has cultivated its image as a progressive company, an image that Schultz himself helped establish by offering employees health insurance, tuition reimbursement and company stock.   But as he prepares to step down from the CEO role, that reputation is being challenged, in large part because of the company’s steadfast opposition to the union. But Schultz, who doesn’t think fighting the workers’ unionization effort will tinge the company’s legacy, is not backing down. ‘People did lose trust’  When Schultz re-joined the company last year, he spent months visiting with employees as part of a listening tour that helped him develop a new roadmap for the company, which he said had “lost its way.”   “I’ve talked to thousands of our Starbucks partners,” he told Harlow. “I was shocked, stunned to hear the loneliness, the anxiety, the fracturing of trust in government, fracturing of trust in companies, fracturing of trust in families, the lack of hope in terms of opportunity.”  Baristas prepare orders at a Starbucks coffee shop in New York, NY.Anthony Behar/Sipa USA/APAmerican companies are “faced with unionization because [workers are] upset, not so much with the company, but the situation.”  Still, Starbucks made some specific missteps, he said, during his absence.   Before he became interim CEO last year Schultz served in the top spot from 1987 to 2000, and then again from 2008 to 2017. But even when he had ceded the role for the final time, he remained involved as chairman of the board — until 2018, when he retired. That four-year lapse, Schultz said, was a “mistake,” adding, “I should have probably stayed engaged.” This time, Schultz will retain his board seat after incoming CEO Laxman Narasimhan takes over.  Especially during the pandemic, “some decisions were made that I would not have made,” he said, without specifying which. When asked for more details, a spokesperson pointed to the resumption of training programs in 2022.   “As a result of that, I think people did lose trust in the leadership of the company.” Efforts to unionize, he said, were spurred “because Starbucks was not leading in a way that was consistent with its history.”   Still, he sees the union as a relatively minor issue that represents the desires of a small group of people.   “I don’t think a union has a place in Starbucks,” he said. “If a de minimis group of people … file for a petition to be unionized, they have a right to do so. But we as a company have a right also to say, we have a different vision that is better.”   But that’s likely not the case, said Rebecca Givan, associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations.

Santiago/Getty Images“I’m sure there’s a large number of people who are interested [in unionizing], but afraid,” she said. “We know, just from general polling data, that many, many workers are interested in organizing collectively or in being represented collectively.” This is especially true among younger workers, she said.   Collectively, workers hold more sway with employers, giving them more power to negotiate.   “If Starbucks really thought that not that many people were interested, then they could pledge neutrality,” Givan said, as Microsoft did last year. Schultz said that just as workers have the right to organize, Starbucks has “the right to defend” itself.   As a CEO, Schultz has been responding “very typically,” Givan said, in how strongly he’s opposed the union. “I think every corporate leader takes it personally and when their workers organize, even though they really shouldn’t,” she said. ‘I don’t see a recession coming’  While Starbucks deals with the union effort at home, it also faces challenges in China, its key growth market. In the three months through January, sales at Starbucks’ Chinese locations open at least 13 months plunged 29% due in part to Covid restrictions.    Despite these setbacks, Starbucks remains bullish on China, even as tension between the country and the United States grows.   “I don’t believe China is an enemy of America,” Schultz told Harlow, describing it instead as a “fierce adversary, especially economically.” In his opinion, there need to be “good, solid geopolitical relations between the Chinese government and the American government.”   As it forges ahead in China, Starbucks is steering clear of Russia, he said.   Starbucks exited the country last year because of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, and Schultz doesn’t see the company ever going back. “I think Starbucks is gone from Russia for good,” he said.   Back in the United States, Schultz is anticipating a “soft landing” for the economy. “I have great confidence in the US economy,” he said. “I don’t see a recession coming.” Inflation, he thinks, has peaked.   That goes for Starbucks pricing, as well. “I don’t think our prices are going up,” he said.

A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chemist checks confiscated powder containing fentanyl at the DEA Northeast Regional Laboratory on October 8, 2019 in New York. Don Emmert/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      The Biden administration on Wednesday sanctioned a network of Sinaloa Cartel members and associated entities for their involvement in the illegal and deadly fentanyl and methamphetamine trade, providing chemicals to “super labs” that produce illicit drugs for the cartel once run by the notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán.   In addition to sanctioning the two brothers running the network – Ludim Zamudio Lerma and Luis Alfonso Zamudio Lerma – the US Treasury also designated four other Mexican nationals and Sinaloa Cartel members as well as six Mexico-based companies.   “The Zamudio Lerma brothers and their network enable the production of synthetic drugs that devastate American lives, while lining the pockets of Sinaloa Cartel leadership,” said Andrea Gacki, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at Treasury. “Depriving this network of access and resources will hinder the Sinaloa Cartel’s ability to produce and traffic the illicit drugs it depends on.”  The action Wednesday was “coordinated closely” with Mexican authorities and is part of a government-wide effort to curb the trafficking of drugs that kill thousands of Americans every year, according to a Treasury news release.   The other sanctioned members of the notorious cartel include Ludim Zamudio Lerma’s son, Ludim Zamudio Ibarra, and Luis Gerardo Flores Madrid for supplying illegal “precursor” chemicals known to be used in manufacturing illicit drugs, as well as two lab operators: Ernesto Machado Torres and Jose Santana Arredondo Beltran, according to the Treasury.   The six companies sanctioned Wednesday are owned or controlled by the Zamudio family and include two companies involved in – or likely involved in – the drug trade as well as two real estate businesses and two import-export businesses.   “Drug trafficking drives instability, fuels corruption and kills young and old. This crisis cuts across every geographic, demographic and economic category in our nation, damaging our prosperity and imposing tremendous suffering on our communities. The production and trafficking of these drugs is a global problem, and the United States is prepared to lead at a global level,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.  While China was the primary source of illicit fentanyl in the US before 2019, patterns changed after the Chinese imposed stricter controls on the drug trade, according to the Congressional Research Service. Since then, Mexico-based organizations – like the Sinaloa Cartel – source precursor chemicals from China to then produce the illicit drugs in Mexican labs before shipping them into the US.   The US government has previously sanctioned cartel members as well as logistical allies used to funnel illicit drugs into the United States, taking action as recently as last month to sanction fentanyl traffickers fueling the US opioid crisis.   The move by Treasury comes after President Joe Biden promised “strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking” in his State of the Union address earlier this month, and as many Republicans criticize the administration for not doing more to stem the flow of the deadly drugs.

Biden’s dramatic visit to Kyiv Monday amid wailing air raid sirens and his soaring speech in Warsaw a day later reinforced the West’s remarkable support for Ukraine’s resistance to Russia and directly repudiated President Vladimir Putin.  But Putin issued his riposte in an annual address, framing the war in Ukraine as a wider existential battle against the West. After Biden vowed the US will be with Ukraine for as long as it takes, Putin’s speech underlined just how long that may be, raising the possibility of more years of war that will stretch the commitment of Western governments and populations to the cause.  China is meanwhile injecting its own strategic play into this widening great power brouhaha. It sent its top diplomat Wang Yi – his ears ringing with US warnings not to send Russia arms to use in Ukraine – to Moscow for high-level talks, even as a Sino-American spy balloon feud simmers.  Video Ad FeedbackWhat would happen if China supports Russia in Ukraine war? Retired lieutenant colonel weighs in    02:07   - Source:CNNIn the latest highly significant move in a week of diplomatic symbolism, Putin welcomed Wang and told him relations between Beijing and Moscow were “reaching new milestones.”  Wang told Putin that the two nations often face “crisis and chaos, but there are always opportunities in a crisis and the latter could possibly turn into the former.”  This week’s developments do not mean that the future national security threats to the US from Beijing and Moscow are the same. The war in Ukraine has often exposed Russian weakness while worries about China’s rising power will preoccupy Washington for much of this century. And the two US foes are not locked in a formal alliance against the US, even if both see ways that they can advance their own aspirations to harm American interests and power by working together.  But this moment finds the United States negotiating worsening foreign policy crises at the same time – with its former Cold War adversaries in the Kremlin and its belligerent new superpower rival led by Xi Jinping. Both these rivals are openly challenging the international rule of law and rejecting norms that have underpinned the international system for decades.  The idea of a global contest between democracies and autocracies seemed theoretical and intangible when Biden voiced it while running for president. Now it is all too real.   And this new and complicated foreign policy picture is not just a problem for American diplomats. Rising challenges abroad as well, as the depletion of US and Western weapons stocks as arms are sent to Ukraine, pose questions about military capacity and whether current defense spending is sufficient. Key Republicans meanwhile are accusing Biden of snubbing voters facing economic and other problems, even as he tries to position Democrats as the protectors of working Americans as the 2024 campaign dawns.Putin and Biden go head-to-head In terms of presidential stagecraft, Biden overshadowed Putin this week, with his daring overnight train journey into Kyiv and speech in the Polish capital, a location chosen for its role on NATO’s frontline. Putin’s address to the Russian parliament was a staider affair, sprinkled with his now familiar nuclear threats and conspiracy theories about the West.  Video Ad FeedbackWatch President Biden's full speech from surprise visit to Kyiv    09:53   - Source:CNNBiden often seemed to be talking directly to the Russian leader, trying to expose him to Russians, Europeans and Americans as a tyrant responsible for disastrous blunders and inhumanity in Ukraine a year after his invasion. He listed strategic consequences of the invasion that drew Kyiv closer to the West and strengthened NATO – exactly the opposite of Putin’s war aims. He mocked the former KGB colonel over how his aggression has led to one Scandinavian state whose national sovereignty was once dominated by the Soviet Union but now wants to join the western alliance: “He thought he’d get the Finlandization of NATO, instead he got the NATOization of Finland … and Sweden.”  And Biden vowed, “President Putin’s craven lust for land and power will fail, and the Ukrainian people’s love for their country will prevail,” he added.  “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.”  That may be the case. But Putin made clear in his speech that there was no prospect of the war ending soon. In telling Russians the conflict was critical to their own nation’s existence and part of an effort by the West to attack Russia, he set the stage for months more bloodshed and narrowed even further already distant avenues for some kind of face-saving exit if Russia does not prevail.  “I want to repeat: It was they who unleashed the war,” Putin said. “And we used and continue to use force to stop it.”  US President Joe Biden, right, walks next to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as he arrives for a visit in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday, February 20.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesBiden and Zelensky are seen in front of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv.Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times/ReduxBiden visits the Wall of Remembrance, a memorial in Kyiv for Ukrainian soldiers killed during Russia's war on Ukraine.Gleb Garanich/ReutersBiden and Zelensky embrace after their visit to the Wall of Remembrance.Gleb Garanich/ReutersBiden poses with Zelensky and Zelensky's wife, Olena, at the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv.Evan Vucci/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesBiden and Zelensky attend a news conference in Kyiv on Monday.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesBiden signs the guest book at the Ukrainian presidential palace.Handout/Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/Getty ImagesBiden meets with Zelensky at the Ukrainian presidential palace.Handout/Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/Getty ImagesBiden walks next to Zelensky after arriving in Kyiv.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter meeting with Zelensky, Biden walks down a train corridor to his cabin.

Kyiv stands proud, it stands tall and most important, it stands free.""Evan Vucci/APIn photos: Biden visits Ukraine and Poland    Prev  Next    To Western ears, Putin seems to be living in an alternative reality. And Biden contradicted his claims of Western imperialism, saying, “I speak once more to the people of Russia. The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The West was not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today.”  But dismissing Putin’s conspiratorial claims and sense that the West is engaged in a long campaign to topple him would be a mistake. While conventional victory may be beyond Russia, Putin may be able to live with a long grinding war that inflicts devastation on more Ukrainian cities, kills more Ukrainians, ends up costing Western governments billions and gradually hikes pressures on leaders in the US and Europe to pull back.  Video Ad Feedback'Alternative reality': CNN correspondent fact-checks Putin's speech    02:18   - Source:CNNThe Russian leader will likely be watching rising opposition to Biden’s involvement in the war among conservatives in the US. On Monday, for instance, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis hinted – on the very day that Biden was standing with Ukrainians in Kyiv – that the future of Ukraine would not be priority should he win the White House.  “The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all that, and steamrolling, that has not even come close to happening,” DeSantis said on Fox. “I think they have shown themselves to be a third-rate military power.”  Comments by DeSantis and other Republicans like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has warned against a “blank check” to Kyiv, show that while Biden can promise the US is with Kyiv for “as long as it takes,” he cannot guarantee it. The 2024 election may be as crucial for Ukraine as it is for the United States. An almost total shut down between Russia and the US  Biden’s trip also demonstrated that the estrangement between the US and Russia – a factor that will shape global politics for years – is almost complete.  Putin, for example, announced Tuesday that Russia would suspend participation in the New START nuclear treaty with the United States. It was not clear what practical impact this would have since Moscow has stopped fully implementing the deal.  Given that its economy is struggling, and its conventional forces are under extreme pressure, Russia also lacks resources to ignite a new nuclear arms race with Washington. But the collapse of one of the last building blocks of a post-Cold War thaw between Russia and the US exemplifies the almost total lack of communication between the rivals.  The Biden administration’s accusation last week that Russia has committed crimes against humanity ensures there will be no return to normality between Washington and Moscow even if the Ukraine war ends.  Any time the top two nuclear powers are not talking is dangerous — one reason why US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday Washington was willing to discuss the nuclear situation with Russia no matter what else was going on. Beijing ignores Washington’s warnings over Ukraine war Even as it confronts Russia in Ukraine, the US is seeking to dampen its latest crisis with China – over what Washington says was a Chinese spy balloon that wafted over the continental US earlier this month. The two showdowns came closer to a linkage this week as the US warned China not to supply Russia with arms that it could use in the war in Ukraine and as Wang headed to Moscow.  Russia and China agreed on a friendship with “no limits” before Russia’s invasion last year, playing into long term US fears of a united front between Moscow and Beijing. The Chinese foreign ministry bristled that Washington, which has sent a stream of high-tech weaponry into Ukraine, was in no position to lecture China on the issue.  Any effort by China to supply arms for the Ukraine war would not shift the strategic balance of the battlefield – but it would be a grave and hostile new front for the US-China rivalry.  US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that such a step would cross a US red line but did not specify what consequences could result.  There is no public evidence yet that China, while offering rhetorical support for Russia over Ukraine, has supplied lethal arms for the conflict. And the idea of a formal alliance against Washington by Russia and China still seems unlikely – given the power imbalance between Beijing and Moscow in China’s favor.  China, which has its own economic problems, may be unwilling to risk US sanctions that could result from sending arms to Moscow. But Beijing may also have an interest in the war being prolonged in the belief that it could distract the US and its military resources from Biden’s growing efforts to respond to China’s dominance in Asia.  A long-dragging conflict could also drive divides between the US and Europe – further playing into China’s foreign policy goals. And it could further incite political dissent in Washington, weakening Biden’s capacity to fulfill his foreign policy goals on the global stage.  So, there are many reasons why China – which has long seen the war in Ukraine through the prism of its rivalry with the US – may not be in a hurry to see the war in Ukraine end.  That’s yet another nettlesome foreign policy problem that Biden must confront.

Hong Kong’s financial secretary expects city’s economy to grow between 3.5% and 5.5%    			By Laura He, CNN		  Updated  2:36 AM EST, Wed February 22, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackSee how Hong Kong is trying to revitalize itself after Covid-19    02:23   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      Hong Kong’s Covid-hit economy will return to growth this year and expand by between 3.5% and 5.5%, as the city opens up and China’s economic outlook improves, Hong Kong’s financial secretary said on Wednesday.  The Asian financial hub suffered a 3.5% contraction last year, as strict Covid restrictions and weakening global demand hurt spending and exports. It was the third contraction in four years for the city of 7 million people.  After Hong Kong significantly relaxed its Covid curbs last month, it is looking to revive the economy through a raft of measures, including offering cash handouts to residents and cutting salaries tax to boost spending. It’s also stepping up a drive to attract workers and investments amid rising competition from Singapore.   Buildings in Hong Kong, China, on Thursday, July 28, 2022.

However, the accelerated growth of the [Chinese] mainland economy coupled with the lifting of restrictions on cross-boundary truck movements should alleviate part of the pressure,” Chan said in a speech outlining the city’s budget for the 2023 to 2024 fiscal year.  The number of visitors is also expected to see “a strong rebound” after Hong Kong removed quarantine requirements for inbound travelers.  “As overall economic sentiment improves, private consumption will increase,” he added.  Previously, analysts had broadly raised their forecasts for Hong Kong’s economic growth to a range between 3% and 6.5%.  “We raise our GDP forecast to reflect accelerated post-Covid reopening and improved China prospects,” analysts from Standard Chartered Bank said in a recent research report, adding that they expect Hong Kong’s GDP to expand by 3.2% in 2023 and 3.6% in 2024.   Industries like tourism, trade, and real estate, are set to “ride the crest of Hong Kong’s reopening wave,” they said.

Will the world buy it?To spur the economy, the Hong Kong government will give out more cash handouts to all adults this year, with each eligible resident due to receive HK$5,000 ($637) in spending vouchers, Chan said on Wednesday. Still, that’s only half of last year’s amount of HK$10,000, as the city’s fiscal deficit has ballooned.   The government will also reduce the salaries tax with a cap of HK$6,000, which should benefit 1.9 million tax payers, Chan said.  Other measures to aid recovery include energy and transportation subsidies to residents, a new capital investment entrant program (which is aimed at attracting overseas investments), more efforts to build a green tech financial market in Hong Kong, and considering allowing stock trading during severe weather. Currently, trading in Hong Kong’s financial market can be suspended under extreme weather, such as a typhoon.

A woman carrying a baby at a store in Seongnam, South Korea, on January 21, 2019.SeongJoon Cho/Bloomber/Getty ImagesSeoul, South KoreaCNN      South Korea’s fertility rate, already the world’s lowest, has dropped yet again in the latest setback to the country’s efforts to boost its declining population. The national statistics body reported Wednesday that the fertility rate, or the average number of children expected per woman, fell to 0.78 in 2022 – down from 0.81 the previous year.  Countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 to maintain a stable population, in the absence of immigration.  South Korea’s birth rate has been falling since 2015 and the country recorded more deaths than births for the first time in 2020, a trend that has continued since.   In 2022, the country recorded about 249,000 births and 372,800 deaths.  Similar demographic declines are being seen in several other Asian countries including Japan and China, raising concerns there will be too few people of working age to support the ballooning elderly population.  Meanwhile, Korean women are also having children later in life. The average age of childbirth in South Korea was 33.5 last year.

But despite the economic factors at play, throwing money at the problem has proved ineffective. Last September, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol admitted that more than $200 billion has been spent trying to boost the population over the past 16 years.  The South Korean government has introduced various initiatives such as extending paid paternity leave, offering monetary “baby vouchers” to new parents, and social campaigns encouraging men to contribute to childcare and housework.  But experts and residents say more support is needed throughout a child’s life – as well as change on several deep-rooted social issues. For instance, South Korean society still frowns on single parents, with IVF treatment not available to single women.   Couples in non-traditional partnerships also face discrimination; South Korea does not recognize same-sex marriage and regulations make it difficult for unwed couples to adopt.

Video Ad Feedback'We must strike': Hear what Russians really think about war in Ukraine    03:22   - Source:CNNCNN      Russian President Vladimir Putin said relations between his country and China are “reaching new milestones” as Beijing’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, wrapped up a visit to Moscow on Wednesday.  “Russian-Chinese relations are developing as we planned in previous years. Everything is moving forward and developing,” Putin told reporters as he sat beside Wang. “Cooperation in the international arena between the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China, as we have repeatedly said, is very important for stabilizing the international situation.”  Wang added that the two countries “often face crisis and chaos, but there are always opportunities in a crisis.”  “This requires us to identify changes more voluntarily and respond to the changes more actively to further strengthen our comprehensive strategic partnership,” Wang said.   Wang’s high-profile visit, just days before the anniversary of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, is widely believed to be a precursor to a meeting between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In December 2022, Putin and Xi held a virtual meeting in which the Russian leader described relations between the two nations as “the best in history,” saying they could “withstand all tests,” and invited Xi to visit Moscow in the spring of 2023.  On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the two leaders would meet in “the coming months,” citing people familiar with the plan. Arrangements for the trip are at an “early stage” and the timing has not been finalized, the WSJ reported, adding that the trip could be in April or early May.  Wang arrived in Moscow just days after US officials went public with concerns about how China’s continuing partnership with Russia could have an impact on the war in Ukraine — and hours after Putin made a major speech on the conflict, in which he announced plans to suspend Russia’s involvement in its last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US.  Wang told Lavrov he expects China and Russia to reach a ""new consensus"" on advancing bilateral relations.Alexander Nemenov/ReutersThe Chinese diplomat held several high-profile meetings in the Russian capital during his visit, speaking with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier Wednesday and Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s Security Council and one of Putin’s closest allies, on Tuesday.  Wang told Lavrov he expects the two countries to reach a “new consensus” on advancing bilateral relations.  “Today I am willing to further exchange views with you, my old friend, on the advancement of our mutual relationship, and I think we will definitely reach new consensus,” Wang told Lavrov on Wednesday.  “No matter how the international situation changes, China has been and remains willing to maintain the positive trend with Russia in building a new type of cooperative relationship between major powers.”  Wang, who was congratulated by Lavrov for his recent promotion as the top foreign policy adviser for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, said he would endeavor to “strengthen and deepen the Sino-Russian friendship” no matter what.  Wang said under the leadership of Xi and Putin, the two countries had maintained their strategic determination, and – in an apparent dig at the United States – “resolutely oppose any unilateral or bullying behavior, and unswervingly safeguard their respective sovereignty, security and development interests.”   On Tuesday, Wang told Patrushev that Beijing’s ties with Moscow are “solid as a rock.”  “Sino-Russian relations are mature and solid as a rock, and will withstand the test of the changing international situation,” Wang was quoted as saying by Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik.   “We are ready, together with the Russian side, in accordance with top-level agreements, to resolutely defend national interests and dignity, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas,” Wang said.  Patrushev told Wang that China and Russia should stick together in face of growing pressure from the West, citing what he falsely described as “the bloody events unleashed by the West in Ukraine” as an example.  Russia has repeatedly accused the West of instigating the war in Ukraine, while attempting to deny responsibility for the reported deaths of tens of thousands of people — and Beijing has parroted the messaging, laying the blame for Moscow’s unprovoked invasion on the United States and its NATO allies.  “In the context of the campaign by the collective West to contain Russia and China, the further deepening of Russian-Chinese coordination and interaction in the international arena carries particular importance,” Patrushev was quoted as saying by Sputnik.  Patrushev also said that Russia and China should seek to create a new, “more just” world order, one that challenges the unipolar hegemony of the collective West, according to Sputnik.  A readout from China’s Foreign Ministry said the two officials agreed to oppose “the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and ideological opposition” — a thinly veiled criticism of the US — and to make more efforts to “improve global governance,” in an apparent reference to Beijing and Moscow’s ambitions to reshape the global order in their favor.  Wang and Patrushev also “exchanged their opinions” on the issue of Ukraine, the statement added, without offering details.Concerns about China roleWang’s trip comes after US President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday in a show of support for the embattled country, which Washington and its European allies have rallied together to back over the past year through both military and humanitarian aid, and economic sanctions against Russia.

But during engagements in European cities in recent days, Wang attempted to present China as a proponent of peace and negotiation, saying at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Saturday that Beijing would release its position on a “political settlement” of the crisis.  Those remarks were met with suspicion from many Western leaders who are closely watching for any support China lends to its northern neighbor, especially amid concerns that Beijing is considering the provision of lethal military aid to Russia.  On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang reiterated Beijing’s messaging on Ukraine at a security forum in the Chinese capital. China was “deeply concerned” the conflict would spiral “out of control,” and would continue to urge peace talks and provide “Chinese wisdom” to bring about a political settlement, he said.  “At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,” he said, in an apparent reference to the US and its allies.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.CNN      One year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is more dangerous than ever.  The Russian dictator marked the anniversary of his unprovoked aggression – which has killed or wounded close to 200,000 of Russia’s own soldiers and turned some 16 million Ukrainians into refugees – by suspending Russia’s participation in a key nuclear arms deal that kept the threat of nuclear war at bay and giving a 100-minute speech to the country on Tuesday blaming Ukraine and its supporters for the war Putin started.   Jill FilipovicCourtesy of Jill FilipovicIn emphasizing his vision of a conservative, traditional and patriarchal Russia at war with a more libertine West, Putin’s speech drew directly from the strongman’s playbook: Deflect blame, lie to suit your own interests, lean into a reactionary and hateful form of masculinity to get the crowds cheering.   It would be something of a pathetic showing if this particular strongman didn’t happen to have control of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world.   The nuclear agreement that Putin suspended, called New START, limited the number of nuclear missiles that both the US and Russia could have deployed and gave both nations the right to inspect each other’s nuclear sites. With Putin’s move to suspend his nation’s participation in the program, the last remaining nuclear deal between the two nations is effectively dead and we have returned to a dangerous era of nuclear dysregulation. Putin’s decision is indeed “deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,” as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it.   Other experts were starker in their assessments. “This is more about nuclear blackmail, but it is extremely dangerous,” Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told the BBC, “because we cannot predict how Putin will behave in the future and what is in his mind.”   For Americans who came of age after the end of the Cold War, this renewed threat of nuclear annihilation is both new and terrifying; for those who lived through the original Cold War, this is no doubt a hair-raising reboot.   But it’s not just about a renewed nuclear threat. In Poland after an historic wartime visit to Kyiv, US President Joe Biden gave a speech of his own, also highlighting a fundamental divide – not between conservative religiosity and liberal tolerance, as Putin put it, but between autocracy and democracy. “The democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker,” Biden said. “But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger.”  US President Joe Biden (R) walks next to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) as he arrives for a visit in Kyiv on February 20, 2023. - US President Joe Biden made a surprise trip to Kyiv on February 20, 2023, ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, AFP journalists saw.

It’s worth nothing, though, that Putin’s emphasis on cultural and gender warfare is also correct, in its own way.   He is of course lying and fear-mongering when he fulminates about same-sex marriage or the prospect of a gender-neutral God and when he says that the West seeks “the destruction of the family, cultural and national identity, perversion and the abuse of children are declared the norm.” It is true, though, that there is a clear historical and contemporary relationship between conservative religiosity and autocracy on the one hand, and liberal tolerance and democracy on the other.   Conservative religiosity is of course not a requirement for autocracy – just look at the previous era of Russian autocracy, which was decidedly irreligious. And the autocrats in Beijing, who are expanding their own nuclear arsenals and toying with lending material support to Russia, are not exactly bringing conservative Christian principles to China.   But they are embracing traditionalism, hypermasculinity and a backward-looking national identity. Among analysists of global authoritarians, a familiar refrain has emerged: Make [x country] Great Again. Xi Jinping is trying to make China great again, writes the New Yorker’s Evan Osnos. “Putin set out to ‘Make Russia Great Again,’” Gen. David Petraeus told CNN earlier this month. And, of course, we all know the American version.   In his speech, Biden took great pains to emphasize that the villain here is Putin, not Russians writ large; while Biden did frame the battle as one between freedom and totalitarianism, he did not feed into Putin’s claims that this is a war between Western liberalism and Russian traditionalism.

REUTERS/Oleksandr RatushniakOleksandr Ratushniak/ReutersGen. David Petraeus: How the war in Ukraine will endIt’s informative, though (and scary) to realize the extent to which a number of right-wing Americans believe Putin has a point about the West being degenerate, and seem comfortable bringing a strongman in to restore the traditional order.   The most salient divide is not between East and West; it’s between those who want pluralistic liberal democracies that allow people to live freely no matter what their religious beliefs, sexual orientations and aspirations – and those who prefer autocratic strongmen who use the law to impose conservative, traditional values whether people like it or not.   Former US President Donald Trump notoriously praised Putin and trashed NATO, elevating the dictator’s status among pro-Trump conservatives. As of a year ago, Republicans in the US had a more favorable view of Putin than of Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party.   Tucker Carlson has used his influential spot on Fox News to spout pro-Putin propaganda. Newly-elected Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has said, “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” while former Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro has declared Ukraine “not really a country,” and former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has praised Putin by saying, “I have enormous respect for him.”   Meanwhile, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed that “NATO has been supplying the neo-Nazis in Ukraine with powerful weapons and extensive training on how to use them.”   On the campaign trail in November she pledged that “Under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine.” Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist who recently dined with Trump and rapper Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago, told his followers, “I wish Putin was president of America.” Andrew Torba, the CEO of the right-wing platform Gab, put the issue in even starker terms last year: “What (Putin) really means is Ukraine needs to be liberated and cleansed from the degeneracy of the secular western globalist empire.”  Putin has positioned his Russia as the leading light for Christian nationalists worldwide, standing against Western secularism and decadence. And many Christian nationalists, including in the United States, have gotten in line.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook This is not just a divide between Russia and the US. It’s a divide within Russia itself, as the nation’s feminists, LGBTQ rights advocates, and democracy activists continue to push (often at great personal risk) for a freer and fairer country. And it’s a divide within the US, too, between the Americans who want liberal democracy to thrive, and those who want their ideology to rule us all.   A year into Putin’s war, it’s clear that he is willing to sacrifice untold lives to cement his power and Russia’s imperial interests. Americans have a choice, both at home and abroad: Do we stand with autocrats and their small, hateful view of the world? Or do we stand for freedom and democracy – including the obligation to live among those whose views you don’t agree with and whose choices you wouldn’t make yourself?   The decision, and the stakes, couldn’t be clearer.

China's top diplomat Wang Yi speaks during the 2023 Munich Security Conference (MSC) on February 18 in Munich, Germany. Johannes Simon/Getty ImagesHong KongCNN      China’s top diplomat Wang Yi arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, in the first visit to Russia by a Chinese official in that role since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began nearly a year ago.  Wang, who was named Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top foreign policy adviser last month, is making the high-profile visit as the final stop in an eight-day international tour that included visits to France, Italy, and Hungary, as well as Germany for a security conference.  He will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, Russian state media TASS reported, citing the Russian foreign ministry. While neither country has specified whether Wang will hold talks with President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that “we do not exclude” such a meeting.  Wang met with the head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, on Tuesday, according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.  The readout said the two officials agreed to oppose “the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and ideological opposition” – a thinly veiled criticism of the US – and to make more efforts to “improve global governance,” in an apparent reference to Beijing and Moscow’s ambitions to reshape the global order in their favor.  Wang and Patrushev also “exchanged their opinions” on the issue of Ukraine, the statement added, without offering details.

(Pavel Bednyakov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)Pavel Bednyakov/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool/APPutin pulls back from last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the USThe diplomat arrived in Moscow just days after US officials went public with concerns about how China’s continuing partnership with Russia could have an impact on the war in Ukraine – and hours after Putin made a major speech on the conflict, in which he announced plans to suspend Russia’s involvement in its last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US.  The Chinese leadership has claimed impartiality in the conflict but refused to condemn Russia’s invasion, instead expanding trade ties and continuing joint military exercises, including this week.  But during engagements in European cities in recent days, Wang built on China’s framing of itself as a proponent of peace and negotiation, saying at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Saturday that Beijing would release its position on a “political settlement” of the crisis.  Those remarks were met with suspicion from some Western leaders who are closely watching for any support China lends to its northern neighbor, especially that which crosses certain “red lines” articulated by Washington.  On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang reiterated Beijing’s messaging on Ukraine at a security forum in the Chinese capital. China was “deeply concerned” the conflict would spiral “out of control,” and would continue to urge peace talks and provide “Chinese wisdom” to bring about a political settlement, he said.  “At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,” he said, in an apparent reference to the US and its allies.US warns China could supply Russia with ‘lethal support’US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration had concerns that Beijing is considering stepping up its partnership with Moscow by supplying the Russian military with “lethal support” as Russia prepares for an expected new offensive.  “We’ve been watching this very closely,” Blinken told CBS’ “Face the Nation” from the MSC in an interview that aired Sunday. “The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.”  Blinken also warned Wang “about the implications and consequences” if China increases its support for Russia’s war effort, during a meeting between the two on the sidelines of the conference, according to a US readout.

(Photo by Dimitar DILKOFF / AFP) (Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images)Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesOpinion: In a war of unending surprises, Biden has another up his sleeveA senior State Department official told reporters that Blinken “was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion.”  US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN earlier Saturday that the US has recently begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines in China’s support for Russia’s military and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught.  Those officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners in Munich over the last several days.  At the MSC, Wang said China was “deeply concerned” by the extended crisis and was not adding “fuel to the fire” – a phrase Beijing’s diplomats have used in the past to accuse the US of perpetuating the conflict. China’s Foreign Ministry on Monday said the US, not China, was the one sending a “steady stream of weapons to the battlefield.”  Wang did not mention the trip to Russia during his prepared remarks or a following live-streamed conversation Saturday on the main stage of the Munich conference, when he was asked by MSC Foundation Council President Wolfgang Ischinger if China was prepared to act on “its position that it respects the territorial integrity” of Ukraine and if so, how.  In meetings with European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, during the earlier phase of his tour last week, Wang stressed China’s commitment to peace talks and an end to the war. The tour was seen as part of China’s bid to bolster its ties with Europe, where analysts say Beijing’s image has been damaged in the past year due to its ties with Moscow.  US President Joe Biden holds a speech at the Royal Castle after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw, Poland, on Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2023.Alastair Grant/APLIVE UPDATES: Russia's war in UkraineA spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry said last Monday that Wang’s visit to Moscow would provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and “exchange views” on “international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest” – a catch-all phrase often used to allude to topics including the war in Ukraine.  “China is ready to take this visit as an opportunity and work with Russia to promote steady growth of bilateral relations in the direction identified by the two heads of state, defend the legitimate rights and interests of both sides, and play an active role for world peace,” the spokesman said.  Wang’s visit may also foreshadow a state visit by Xi to Moscow later this year. Putin extended an invitation to Xi during a customary end-of-year call between the two leaders, but China’s Foreign Ministry has yet to confirm any plans.  In an editorial Tuesday, state-run nationalist tabloid the Global Times hailed the friendship between China and Russia as “a positive asset of the world,” and accused some in the West of attempting to use the conflict in Ukraine to “hijack” Sino-Russian relations.   “The United States has viewed the friendly relations between China and Russia with thick tinted glasses from the very beginning,” it said. “In fact, no matter whether the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out, the US does not want to see China and Russia develop close relations. The suspicion, provocation and sabotage from Washington have never ceased.”    CNN’s Nectar Gan contributed to reporting.

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida delivers a speech during the opening of the 4th Tokyo Global Dialogue in Tokyo on February 20, 2023. Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty ImagesTokyoCNN      Japan pledged $5.5 billion in humanitarian aid to Ukraine on Monday, nearly quadrupling the amount of money Tokyo has promised to Kyiv since Russia invaded its neighbor nearly a year ago.  “Japan is in a position to lead the world’s efforts to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression and to uphold a free and open international order based on the rule of law,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday.   Tokyo had previously pledged to send Kyiv $600 million in financial assistance and $700 million worth of humanitarian aid including medical supplies and food assistance. It also joined Western allies in imposing strict sanctions on Russia over its invasion.  Last summer, Kishida said in a speech that Russia’s invasion gave warning that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow” – and he echoed that language Monday.  “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is not just a European matter, but a challenge to the rules and principles of the entire international community,” he said.  He added that Japan faces its “most severe” security environment since World War II, citing North Korea’s growing nuclear missile program and “attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas.”  Photo-Illustration:CNN/Getty ImagesJapan's tough talk on Russia is really about ChinaKishida did not name specifics, but Tokyo has seen itself increasingly at odds with Beijing over islands claimed by both Japan and China in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, Kishida and other Japanese officials have previously said that peace across the Taiwan Strait is of extreme importance to Japan’s security.  Late last year, Kishida announced a large increase in Japanese military spending and Tokyo’s intention to acquire long-range weapons to counter threats to Japan’s security.  Kishida also announced on Monday that he will host an online summit of G7 leaders with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday, the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion and ahead of the annual G7 summit in Hiroshima in May.  The Japanese leader said Hiroshima was an appropriate venue for the summit as the city was the site of an atomic bombing during World War II and Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine is raising new nuclear fears.  “Due to Russia’s actions, the world now faces a real threat from nuclear weapons,” Kishida said. “It is important to convey the reality of the atomic bombings to the world, including the G7 leaders, as the starting point for all efforts toward nuclear disarmament.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

First lady Jill Biden visits Quito, Ecuador, in this May 2022 file photo.Agencia Press South/Getty ImagesCNN      Jill Biden will travel to Namibia and Kenya this week, her first visit to the continent since becoming first lady as the White House looks to strengthen ties with the region.  The visit, the first by a White House principal this year to sub-Saharan Africa, begins on Wednesday and will wrap on Sunday, the White House said. It comes ahead of expected visits by her husband President Joe Biden and other senior administration officials later this year.  “The purpose of her trip is to reaffirm the US government’s investments in Africa, not just in their governments, but in their people and to continue her work to empower women and young people,” a senior administration official previewing the trip said.  Another senior administration official described the trip as a “demonstration of President Biden’s commitment that the United States is all in on Africa and all in with Africa.”  The first lady will arrive Wednesday in Namibia, where “her efforts are really focused on the role of young people in continuing to shape their democracy and advance health cooperation,” one official added.  Biden then will make her way to Kenya, where food insecurity and the impact of drought in the Horn of Africa will be front and center as she aims to “draw attention to what is a dire and immediate food crisis that cannot wait for further intervention and mobilization from the international community,” the official said.   She will also meet with the first ladies of each country and engage with organizations that work on youth engagement and women’s empowerment, including issues relating to gender-based violence.    Biden visited Africa five times as second lady, including a 2011 stop at the largest refugee camp in Kenya as thousands fled Somalia. This will mark her third trip ever to Kenya and first to Namibia, making her the most senior US official to travel to the country since then-Vice President Al Gore visited in 1996.  The Biden administration has sought to bolster its relationships with African countries at a time when Russia and China have made inroads in the region, which is home to some of the world’s fastest growing economies.  “Our policy towards Africa is about what we do with Africans,” one senior administration official said. “That doesn’t mean that we are not aware of the strategic moment we’re in, but we are not defining our policy by the role of China in Africa. … Many of our officials have conversations with Africans about China, but I don’t anticipate that to be a focus of this conversation.”  Last year, the president hosted nearly 50 African leaders at the US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, DC, where he announced billions of dollars of investments relating to financing and bolstering democracy. President Biden also said he was “eager” to visit Africa in 2023, adding, “‘Some of you invited me to your countries. I said, ‘Be careful what you wish for because I may show up.’”  The White House has yet to detail when President Biden might visit Africa. Vice President Kamala Harris is also expected to travel to the continent in the coming months.

US President Joe Biden made a surprise trip to Kyiv on February 20, 2023, ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesWarsaw, PolandCNN      President Joe Biden slipped into Kyiv on Monday for the first time since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago, demonstrating in dramatic personal fashion his commitment to the country and its struggle as the war enters an uncertain new phase.  The highly secretive visit – which took place as air raid sirens could be heard ringing out around Kyiv while Biden walked alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky around the gold-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral – comes at a critical moment in the 12-month conflict, with Russia preparing for an expected spring offensive and Ukraine hoping to soon retake territory.   Biden announced a half-billion dollars in new assistance, saying the package would include more military equipment, such as artillery ammunition, more javelins and Howitzers. And he said new sanctions would be imposed on Moscow later this week.  “One year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,” Biden said.  The United States and other Western nations have been rushing arms, tanks and ammunition to Ukraine in the hopes of changing the trajectory of the war. By visiting in person, Biden is offering a singular image of American support for Zelensky, who has spent the past year attempting to rally the world behind his nation and appealing for greater levels of assistance.  Biden arrived in Kyiv at 8 a.m. local time after a lengthy, covert journey from Washington and arrived to the Mariinsky Palace half-an-hour later. He departed Kyiv in the early afternoon.   “Thank you for coming,” Zelensky said, shaking Biden’s hand.  US officials have privately voiced hope the massive influx of weaponry to Ukraine – which includes new vehicles, longer-range missiles and Patriot air defense systems – can help Ukraine prevail on the battlefield and put Zelensky in a stronger position to negotiate an end to the war.   But it remains unclear what parameters Zelensky might be willing to accept in any peace negotiations, and the US has steadfastly refused to define what a settlement may look like beyond stating it will be up to Zelensky to decide.   20 February 2023, Ukraine, Kiew: U.S. President Joe Biden (M, l) visits St. Sophia Cathedral in the capital together with Volodymyr Selenskyj (M, r), President of Ukraine.

Speaking from Kyiv, Biden declared Putin’s “war of conquest is failing.”  “Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided,” Biden said, standing alongside Zelensky. “He thought he could outlast us. I don’t think he’s thinking that right now.”  “He’s just been plain wrong,” Biden said of Putin. “One year later, the evidence is right here in this room. We stand here together.”  During their talks inside the presidential palace, Biden laid out his rationale for visiting the Ukrainian capital as the war enters a second year.  “I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about US support for Ukraine in the war,” Biden said.  “The Ukrainian people have stepped up in a way that few people ever have in the past,” he added.   Biden emphasized there was broad, bipartisan support in Washington for the Ukrainian cause.  “For all the disagreement we have in our Congress on some issues, there is significant agreement on support for Ukraine,” he said.   “It’s not just about freedom in Ukraine. … It’s about freedom of democracy at large,” he said  Biden was intently focused on discussing the coming months of fighting when he sat down with Zelensky, according to national security adviser Jake Sullivan.   “The President was very focused on making sure that he made the most of his time on the ground, which he knew was going to be limited,” Sullivan said. “So he was quite focused on how he was going to approach his conversation with President Zelensky and in part how the two of them were really going to look out over the course of 2023 and try to come to a common understanding of what the objectives are.”   White House officials would not go into details about the logistics of the president’s trip, saying that more details would come once they “got the green light from the security folks.”  US President Joe Biden, right, walks next to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as he arrives for a visit in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday, February 20.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesBiden and Zelensky are seen in front of St. Michaels Golden-Domed Cathedral in Kyiv.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesBiden visits the Wall of Remembrance, in memorial to Ukrainian soldiers killed during Russia's war on Ukraine.Gleb Garanich/ReutersBiden and Zelenskiy embrace after their visit to the Wall of Remembrance in Kyiv.Gleb Garanich/ReutersBiden poses with President Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska, at Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv.Evan Vucci/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesBiden and Zelensky attend a press conference in Kyiv on Monday.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesPresident Biden signs the guest book at the Ukrainian presidential palace.Handout/Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/Getty ImagesBiden meets with Zelensky at the Ukrainian presidential palace.Handout/Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/Getty ImagesBiden walks next to Zelensky as he arrives for a surprise visit to Kyiv.Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesBiden walks down a train corridor to his cabin after visiting with Zelensky.

Air Force One departed Joint Base Andrews under cover of darkness at 4:15 a.m. ET on Sunday, and reporters aboard the plane were not allowed to carry their devices with them.  Biden’s public schedule didn’t reflect the trip, and White House officials repeatedly said last week that a visit to Ukraine was not in the works.   Biden only decided on Friday to go ahead with the visit after huddling with top members of his national security team in the Oval Office. A few hours before he departed, the United States informed Russia of the plans to visit the Ukrainian capital for “deconfliction purposes,” according to Sullivan.  Biden was presented with a range of options for a visit to Ukraine, but decided that a trip to Kyiv made the most sense, a source familiar with the matter said. As Biden was briefed over several months on the planning for a potential visit, the source said that Biden only once expressed concern about the risk of a visit to Ukraine – but that was about the extent to which his visit could endanger others, rather than about his own safety. Other officials were obviously extremely concerned about Biden’s own safety and prepared a series of security contingency plans.  On Saturday evening, before he departed, Biden went out to dinner with his wife in Washington. He wasn’t seen in public again until arriving in Kyiv on Monday morning.  Ukraine is an active war zone where the US military has no control, making Monday’s visit different from previous presidential trips to Iraq or Afghanistan. White House officials had repeatedly ruled out a visit earlier in the year.  The Friday session in the Oval Office was the culmination of months of work by a tiny handful of Biden’s top aides to plan the trip around the anniversary of the start of the war. The planning included the chief of staff’s office, the National Security Council and the White House Military Office, with input from a small number of officials at the US Secret Service, the Pentagon and the Intelligence Community, according to deputy national security adviser Jon Finer.  Biden was regularly briefed on the plans for the trip, including threat assessments, as the visit came together.   Discussions between the White House and the “highest levels of the Ukrainian government” helped bring the trip over the finish line.  “He was satisfied the risk was manageable,” Sullivan said.  “This was a risk that Joe Biden wanted to take,” said communications director Kate Bedingfield. “It’s important to him to show up, even when it’s hard, and he directed his team to make it happen no matter how challenging the logistics.”  Biden traveled with a relatively small entourage, including Sullivan, deputy chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon and personal aide Annie Tomasini.  Zelensky himself traveled to Washington in December to meet Biden in the Oval Office and speak to a joint session of Congress – his first trip outside Ukraine since the war began.  The Ukrainian leader invited Biden to visit Kyiv months ago, saying he believed it was important for the US leader to see the situation up close.

Credit: PoolPool    Biden’s visit follows other world leaders’ tripsBiden has been itching to visit Ukraine for months, particularly after several of his counterparts in Europe all endured lengthy train journeys to meet with Zelensky in Kyiv. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as well as former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have all made visits to the country to demonstrate their support.  Several of Biden’s top lieutenants, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, have also visited the Ukrainian capital to pledge new assistance. Senior administration officials, including CIA Director Bill Burns and top White House officials, visited Kyiv last month.   Even Biden’s wife, Dr. Jill Biden, paid a surprise visit on Mother’s Day last year to a small city in the far southwestern corner of Ukraine. She met with Zelenska at a former school that was converted into temporary housing for displaced Ukrainians, including 48 children.   Now, with the war nearing its one-year mark on February 24, Biden is hoping to demonstrate to the world his commitment to Ukraine, even as it remains unclear how much longer US and western resolve can last.   Asked about the significance of being in Kyiv, Biden noted it was his eighth visit to the city. “Each time more significant,” Biden said.   He added that the purpose of his visit was to convey to Zelensky that the US is “here to stay.”  “We’re not leaving,” Biden said.

The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the last several days.  Blinken raised the issue when he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, officials said.  Wang, who was named Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top foreign policy adviser last month, is expected to arrive in Moscow this week, in the first visit to the country from a Chinese official in that role since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   According to China’s Foreign Ministry, Wang’s visit will provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and “exchange views” on “international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest” – a catch-all phrase often used to allude to topics including the war in Ukraine.  This is a breaking story and will be updated.  CNN’s Jeremy Diamond and Nectar Gan contributed to this report.

"2,400-year-old flush toilet discovered in China could be one of the oldest ever found - CNN Style","2,400-year-old flush toilet discovered in China could be one of the oldest ever found - CNN Styleluxury2,400-year-old flush toilet discovered in China could be one of the oldest ever Updated 22nd February 2023Credit: Xinhua/Shutterstock2,400-year-old flush toilet discovered in China could be one of the oldest ever Written by Tara Subramaniam, CNNHong KongArcheologists in China have found the remains of what may be the world's oldest known flush toilet.Broken parts of the 2,400-year-old lavatory, as well as a bent flush pipe, were unearthed last summer by a research team among ancient palace ruins in the Yueyang archaeological site in the central city of Xi'an, according to Chinese state media.Details of the find were released last week, sparking widespread interest in China and offering a rare insight into the privileged and comparatively advanced world of the country's ancient ruling elite.Described by researchers as a ""luxury object,"" the toilet was thought to have been located inside the palace, with a pipe leading to an outdoor pit, according to state-owned China Daily. Liu Rui, a researcher at the Institute of Archeology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who was part of the excavation team, told state media the toilet would have likely been reserved for high-ranking officials during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC) and the later Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). He added that servants would likely have poured water into the toilet bowl every time it was used.""The flush toilet is concrete proof of the importance the ancient Chinese attached to sanitation,"" Liu said, adding that there were very few records of indoor toilets in ancient times.Archaeologists uncover ancient tombs of wealthy Chinese clanAccess to clean, flush toilets remain an issue in parts of modern China. Early in his tenure, Chinese leader Xi Jinping promised to ""revolutionize"" the country's restrooms, as part of efforts to improve rural hygiene. ""The toilet issue is no small thing, it's an important aspect of building civilized cities and countryside,"" Xi said in an article in the state-owned People's Daily in 2018. ""This work should be advanced as a specific task of rural revitalization and such shortcomings that affect the quality of people's life should be filled with great efforts.""Prior to the newly announced discovery, the invention of the first flush toilet was widely credited to English courtier John Harington, who supposedly installed one for Queen Elizabeth in the 16th century, though 4,000-year-old drainage systems that might have been connected with toilets have been found in northwest India. The ruins from Yueyang, the former capital of Qin State and later the first capital of the Han Dynasty, were discovered in the 1980s. The recent find is part of a broader effort to understand ancient Chinese dynasties, including how people lived and how their cities were constructed, the Institute said in a statement announcing the discoveries.  Archaeologists are now analyzing soil samples collected from the toilet in hopes of finding out what people ate during that time, according to China Daily.Top image caption: The unearthed flush lavatory, which is comprised of a toilet bowl and sewage system, excavated from the Yueyang site in Xi'an, China.

Wang Yi – who was promoted as Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top foreign policy adviser last month – is due to arrive in Moscow this week for the final stop of his eight-day Europe tour, a trip that brings into focus China’s attempted diplomatic balancing act since Russia tanks rolled into Ukraine a year ago.   The Kremlin has said it does not “rule out” a meeting between Wang and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. If they do meet, the images of Wang and Putin shaking hands inside the fortified Kremlin will be a stark juxtaposition to Biden’s open-air stroll with Zelensky through Kyiv amid air raid sirens.  The optics of the two trips – taking place just days before the one-year anniversary of the brutal war on Friday – underscores the sharpening of geopolitical fault lines between the world’s two superpowers.  Video Ad FeedbackExpert has theory on why Russia may be involved with unidentified objects    01:18   - Source:CNNWhile relations between the US and China continue to plummet – most recently due to the fallout from a suspected Chinese spy balloon that entered US airspace, China and Russia are as close as ever since their leaders declared a “no-limits” friendship a year ago – partly driven by their shared animosity toward the United States.  And as the US and its allies reaffirm their support for Ukraine and step up military aid, Beijing’s deepening partnership with Moscow has raised alarms in Western capitals – despite China’s public charm offensive in Europe to present itself as a negotiator of peace.  Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, on February 4, 2022. Li Tao/APChina and Russia are as close as ever, and that's a problem for the USAt the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Wang addressed a room of European officials as “dear friends” and touted China’s commitment to peace, while apparently attempting to drive a wedge between Europe and the US.  “We do not add fuel to the fire, and we’re against reaping benefits from this crisis,” Wang said in a thinly veiled dig at the US, echoing the propaganda messaging that regularly made China’s nightly prime-time news program – that the US is intentionally prolonging the war to advance its own geopolitical interests and increase the profits of its arms manufacturers.  “Some forces might not want to see peace talks to materialize. They don’t care about the life and death of Ukrainians, nor the harm on Europe. They might have strategic goals larger than Ukraine itself. This warfare must not continue,” Wang said.  He urged European officials to think about “what framework should there be to bring lasting peace to Europe, what role should Europe play to manifest its strategic autonomy.”   Wang also announced Beijing’s plan to release its proposition on a “political settlement of the Ukraine crisis” around the first anniversary.  Video Ad FeedbackRetired general: A weak Russia would be satisfying for Xi    03:14   - Source:CNNBut the vague mention of the proposal was met with suspicion from some Western leaders who are closely watching for any support China lends to its northern neighbor – especially assistance that could help Russia on the battlefield.  “We need more proof that China isn’t working with Russia, and we aren’t seeing that now,” European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen told CNN Saturday.  Such suspicions are compounded by claims by US officials that Beijing is considering stepping up its partnership with Moscow by supplying Russia’s military with “lethal support.”  “We’ve been watching this very closely,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told “Face the Nation” on CBS in Munich on Sunday.  “The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” Blinken said.

The US side is not qualified to lecture China, and we would never accept the US dictating or even coercing pressure on Sino-Russian relations,” a ministry spokesperson said at a regular news conference.  “Who is calling for dialogue and peace? And who is handing out knives and encouraging confrontation? The international community can see clearly,” the spokesperson said.  US officials have been concerned enough with the intelligence that they shared it with allies and partners in Munich, according to CNN reporting. In a meeting with Wang on the sidelines of the conference Saturday, Blinken also raised the issue and warned Wang about its “implications and consequences,” according to a US readout.  Video Ad FeedbackReporter shares what Blinken and Chinese foreign minister discussed    01:57   - Source:CNNThe US accusations, if true, would mark a major escalation in China’s support for Russia – and usher in a dangerous and unpredictable new phase in the war itself.   Previously, Beijing had carefully avoided actions that could trigger secondary sanctions, which would deal a devastating blow to an economy hampered by three years of costly zero-Covid policy.  Though China claimed impartiality in the conflict and no advance knowledge of Russia’s intent, it has refused to condemn Moscow and parroted Kremlin lines blaming NATO for provoking the conflict.  And while Beijing’s pro-Russian rhetoric appears to have softened in recent months, its support for Moscow – when measured by its annual trade, diplomatic engagements and schedule of joint military exercises – has bolstered over the past year.  Chinese officials have often calibrated their narrative to different audiences. Wang may have made many appealing pledges during his Europe tour, but whether they will be translated into a consistent message to be delivered to Putin when the two meet is another question.

Kris He, left, and David Liu discuss a purchase at Liu's gun store.Kyung Lah/CNNThe 22-year-old immigrant from mainland China walked past a Trump flag, past the rifles, and headed to the glass case displaying handguns. He didn’t grow up around guns, but after seeing the gun store’s website in Chinese, he hoped owner David Liu would answer some of his questions.  “I speak Mandarin and Cantonese. They can use their mother tongue and talk to me. I will try to explain to them about the law and about the safety of firearms,” said Liu.   David Liu is the owner of Arcadia Firearm & Safety.Kyung Lah/CNNLiu opened Arcadia Firearm & Safety in 2016, hoping to reach the growing Asian American population in the suburban sprawl east of Los Angeles. The store sits above a Chinese restaurant, just a few minutes’ drive from Monterey Park. The mass shooting in that majority-Asian community last month is the reason why He sought to get a gun license.  In the wake of the mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, a growing number of Asian Americans are buying, or considering buying, guns for protection. Gun safety activists say this trend is in response to increased racial tensions across the country exacerbated by the pandemic and a nationwide gun violence epidemic.Kris He came into Liu's store shortly after getting his gun license.Kyung Lah/CNN“I’m afraid in my house,” said He. One of He’s friends lost his aunt in the Monterey Park shooting that killed 11 people, mostly Asian. He, who is not a native English speaker, said, “I think if you have gun, I have gun. I afraid you, you afraid me. So, it’s safe.”  Liu unlocked his glass case and gave He a handgun to hold, bluntly explaining, in Mandarin, how a new gun owner should train and safely live with a deadly weapon. He said he would think about it and promised to come back. Attacks against Asian Americans on the riseAsian American buyers make up a small percentage of overall gun sales in the US. In 2021, a Pew Research Center survey found 10% of Asian adults reported they personally owned a gun and another 10% said they live in a household with a gun owner. Thirty-six percent of White adults said they own a gun with another 11% saying they live with a gun owner.   But during the pandemic, the 2021 National Firearms Survey found that many new gun owners were people of color, including Asian Americans.  Chris Cheng and Trish Sargentini, in the foreground, practice at Cheng's private range.Kyung Lah/CNNTrish Sargentini, 34, was one of those new Asian American gun buyers.  A biotech worker, Sargentini bought a gun for self-defense during the pandemic, driven by fear, a feeling that was entirely new to her living in the Bay Area. “I definitely felt very worried for myself and others in the Asian American community,” said Sargentini, reflecting on the dozens of viral videos of Asian Americans being spat on, beaten, tripped and in some cases, murdered. “That was the first time that it was very clear that I wasn’t just American. Suddenly, I’m Asian American.”  Charlie Ha, a civil engineer in South San Jose and Vietnamese American, bought his first gun during the pandemic. “People were being xenophobic, blaming China and other minorities who look like they’re Chinese. Being marginalized all your life, it wears on you. When things hit the fan like in this case, it definitely encouraged people to get firearms to protect themselves,” said Ha.  Ha turned to his childhood friend Conrad Bui, a San Francisco chiropractor, for help finding a gun and proper training.  Bui says his own wife’s attitude about guns has fundamentally changed after watching videos on social media of Asian Americans being harassed. “My wife feels it’s dangerous going out there and that she doesn’t feel safe anymore,” said Bui.

Everyone has a right to do these things.”  Conrad Bui, left, is a chiropractor. His friend Charlie Ha, right, is a civil engineer.Kyung Lah/CNNHa, Bui and Sargentini gathered at Chris Cheng’s private gun range near Santa Cruz for target practice, what they call their Asian American gun community.  “This is what my gun experience has been like,” said Cheng, waving at the three Asian friends. “The face of the typical gun owner being White, that can send a message to say, ‘oh, gun ownership is a civil right is only for White people,’ which is just factually incorrect,” said Cheng.   A gay man, Cheng said, “I’m a diversity and inclusion advocate, no matter where I am, whether it’s in the gun community, whether it’s in my day job in Silicon Valley.”The gun industry benefits, too Cheng found fame on History Channel’s reality TV show, “Top Shot.” At the start of the series, he was an amateur gun owner with no formal training. He ended up beating 17 professional marksmen on the show to win a $100,000 cash prize and a contract with a gun seller. That moved him from a life in tech to what he now calls civil rights advocacy in the firearms community.  Chris Cheng is pictured in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood, where he lives with his husband.Kyung Lah/CNNCheng doesn’t shy away from what he believes is a fundamental right that Asian Americans culturally have avoided. “Responsible gun ownership is for every American in this country, regardless of the color of your skin,” said Cheng.  He took that message to the 2015 meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm industry trade association, delivering a speech titled, “Diversity: The Next Big Opportunity.” Cheng told the participants that there is an “opportunity for us to promote the Second Amendment, to promote hunting and sports shooting to this new demographic and make them a multigenerational customer and lifelong Second Amendment advocate.” He urged the industry to recognize that “diversity is the next area of success” by targeting messages to ethnic groups and highlighting people of color in marketing.  Cheng’s message caught the attention of the Violence Policy Center, a non-profit educational organization that approaches gun violence from a public health perspective.  “You could call Chris Cheng an ambassador at best and a salesman at worst,” says Josh Sugarmann, Violence Policy Center executive director. The organization included Cheng in a 2021 analysis titled, “How the Firearms Industry Markets Guns to Asian Americans.”  “What you’re seeing head-on is the marketing efforts by the gun industry to target a new market. The primary base of the gun industry’s sales attention has been older White males. And what’s happening is they’re dying off. To borrow a phrase in the tobacco industry, the industry is not finding replacement shooters to take their place.”  During the pandemic, the gun industry promoted on social media that the path to #StopAsianHate was through more weapons. “They saw an opportunity with the hate crimes committed against Asian Americans during the pandemic and they stepped in and said, ‘this is something we can exploit,’” said Sugarmann.  Cheng admits that diversifying the customer base leads to a stronger business. “If you want to look at the firearms industry from a business perspective. Sure, right? Anytime a business diversifies (its) demographics, of course, that’s good for the bottom line. But this accusation that gun companies put profits over people is just not what the industry is about. The industry is about providing people with the firearm to protect themselves if they choose to do so.”Joining the mainstreamGloria Pan, senior vice president at Moms Rising, a gun safety group, says of Asian American fears, “I understand. I’m Asian, too.” But she disagrees with the idea that more guns in her community make it safer. “There are very few verified defensive gun use cases, only about a couple of thousand annually. Balance that against the more than 48,000 firearm deaths, tens of thousands of injuries, hundreds of thousands of abusive uses, and the fact that close to half a million guns are stolen each year. Does he really want to carry a gun around and risk accidentally shooting someone when the actual safety benefits are so slim?”  Pan says historically, Asian American communities have experienced the lowest levels of harm from gun violence because simply put, there are fewer guns in the community.  “We have not had guns on the brain, which, when people have problems, makes turning to firearms as a possible solution that much likelier,” said Pan. “Bringing guns into the AAPI community will only increase gun violence in our community. That’s exactly what happened in Monterey Park. An ostensibly harmless elderly Asian man’s mind was captured by the idea of guns. He decided they were a good idea and brought them into the community. Look what happened.”  Trish Sargentini says she bought a gun for self-defense during the pandemic, driven by fear.Kyung Lah/CNNSargentini, however, bristles at the argument that making guns more palatable to Asians is dangerous.  “Why are you trying to disarm and further repress an entire group of people?” said Sargentini. “It’s like saying women who can read are threatening, right? Other women, women of color, minorities, the disenfranchised – this is an opportunity for them to learn protection of self, learn a new skill. We want to be good people and be good citizens.”  After the two mass shootings in California, Sargentini and her friends at the gun range discussed the challenges Asian Americans face and barriers to accessing care for mental illness. They also discussed how to safely store weapons, train and report dangerous behavior.  As Asian Americans buy more guns, they are now also faced with how to prevent gun deaths in their communities.

Standard Chartered plans hiring spree in Hong Kong as city reopens to China    			By Michelle Toh, CNN		  Published  1:31 AM EST, Tue February 21, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackOne of the world's longest border closures ended. See the scene of family reunion    02:56   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      Standard Chartered is going on a hiring spree in Hong Kong this year, in a sign of renewed confidence in its biggest market as the city reopens its border with mainland China.  The British bank said it would add 300 to 500 employees to its ranks of roughly 5,500 to 5,800. That would lift its current headcount in the city by up to 9%.  The move comes as the lender’s business in the global finance hub begins to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  In a results presentation Friday, Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford said that despite Hong Kong’s economic challenges, the bank grew its operating income in the city by 9% to just over $3.7 billion, which was “back to around 2019 levels.”   Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee speaks during ""Hello Hong Kong"" campaign to promote city tourism in Hong Kong, China February 2, 2023. Tyrone Siu/ReutersHong Kong and Macao will fully reopen borders with mainland ChinaThe firm is encouraged by early signs of “a pickup” in Hong Kong, he told analysts.  Standard Chartered    (SCBFF) Hong Kong CEO Mary Huen said the new recruitment drive would position the bank to capitalize on the reopening of the city’s border with mainland China.  China fully reopened its borders with its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao this month, in what is expected to be a major boost for the economies of the two cities.  The reopening “is set to increase business opportunities” in fintech, wealth management and China’s Greater Bay Area, an economic zone that connects Guangdong province with Hong Kong and Macao, Huen said Friday.  “We need to hire more people as we expect there will be a good growth in loan and wealth management demand this year,” she added.  HSBC    (HSBC), Hong Kong’s leading bank, also flagged a strong performance in the city.  In a Tuesday earnings statement, CEO Noel Quinn said the London-based lender had “gained market share last year in key products, including customer deposits, insurance and trade finance.”  Chairman Mark Tucker said the firm was anticipating a boost in business from China’s resurgence.

(Kevin Broad/CNN)Kevin Broad/CNN'The worst is behind us': Hong Kong hosts top global bankers for finance summit“The reopening of the border means that Hong Kong, and the entire Greater Bay Area, are likely to be major beneficiaries, and I expect to see a strong recovery,” he said in the statement.  HSBC reported a 92% jump in adjusted pretax profit to $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was higher than analysts’ expectations. Hong Kong is also its biggest market. The city hopes to stage a comeback as it continues to recover from two and a half years of pandemic restrictions.  In November, the city’s leader, John Lee, welcomed some of Wall Street’s top executives to its biggest international event in years, urging them to invest locally and seeking to reassure them that it would maintain a distinct role to that of mainland China.

The public says it’s not nearly enough    			By Laura He, CNN		  Published  2:46 AM EST, Mon February 20, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackFried chicken and rice pizzas: How inflation is changing menus in Asia    03:29   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      Beijing will give out a $6 monthly cash subsidy to low-income residents to cushion the impact of rising food prices, a move that has unexpectedly angered many online who say the amount is far too low.  The announcement from the city government comes as food inflation accelerated in China after policymakers scrapped their zero-Covid strategy in December and eased monetary policy further to fuel economic recovery.Last week, protests by retirees broke out in the cities of Wuhan and Dalian over cuts to their medical care benefits, highlighting the growing risk of unrest over livelihood issues as China’s economy struggles to regain its footing after being drained by pandemic policies.  The demonstrations were the latest outburst of public discontent since mass protests against Covid curbs gripped the country late last year. The recent protests underscored the financial pressure on local governments, after three years of the zero-Covid policy strained their coffers and a property market slump severely eroded their income.   Pork for sale at a wholesale market in Beijing on January 12, 2023. Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileAccording to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform, the city’s economic regulator, more than 300,000 people on low incomes will each receive a cash payment of 40 yuan (about $6) per month. The first payment will be given out later this month and it’s unclear for how long they will continue.  “In January, food prices in Beijing rose by 6.6%, meeting the conditions for starting the price-linked subsidy program,” the state-run Beijing Daily newspaper quoted an official from the commission as saying in a Friday report.  “[We will] try to do a good job in ensuring the basic livelihood of the needy people … and continuously enhance the people’s sense of gain, happiness and security.”  China launched a low-income subsidy program in 2011 to offer cash handouts to the needy when the consumer price index or food prices hit certain thresholds. Each city or region sets its own standard as living costs vary across the country.  The news of Beijing’s latest handout was not well received by the public, who took to social media to complain about the high cost of living in the city.

[When] the low-income people take the subway to collect the money and then they return, they lose 8 yuan,” said one comment on Weibo.  “Is it like an insult? [The amount] just subsidizes a bowl of noodles,” another Weibo user said.  Some people criticized the country’s weak social welfare system, while others blasted the government’s move to write off billions of debt to other countries.  “Can’t we question the move? Do you think the current welfare system in our country is good? Can it meet the needs of people?” one said.China’s consumer inflation accelerated in January, as the CPI rose 2.1% from a year earlier. Although the headline figure remains relatively low compared to other countries, food prices jumped 6.2%, with pork and fruit prices rising the most.   In Beijing, food prices outpaced the national level. Vegetable prices soared 24% last month.

Some arrived late at night, soaking wet, and had to wait many long hours, most of the time well into the next day, to enter Romania. The freezing temperatures and daily snowfall made the long queues even harder to bear.  I saw women and children dropped off by husbands, fathers and partners, as able men were barred from leaving Ukraine, allowed only to accompany loved ones to the border and then return to fight. Couples reached for each other through the chain-linked border fence, in scenes that were at times surreal and cinematic.  For Eastern Europe, the Ukrainian tragedy strikes a deep chord – not only because of its proximity but because stories of Soviet occupation are still entrenched in the public mindset. In places like Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Slovakia, and the Baltics, those memories intertwine with the momentous change of becoming European Union member states.

These former communist countries, now European Union member states, know all too well what their warmongering eastern neighbor is capable of. When Ukraine came under attack, these former Eastern Bloc members feared they could be next. They responded quickly, helping the millions of Ukrainians fleeing war and sending weapons to assist Kyiv in its fight. Such a unity in response could very well help rejuvenate the European Union.  That said, for a region that has sought to align itself with the West, that process has not been an easy one.   Now, Ukraine is looking westward quite eagerly. On the eve of Russia’s invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky sought both EU and NATO membership. Those aspirations are being taken seriously—and have received a significant boost. Today, the European Union leaders agreed to grant Ukraine, along with Moldova, candidate status to join the EU.  “We want to support Ukraine in its European journey,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had said earlier this month, appearing alongside Zelensky in Kyiv.  As Ukraine pursues its hopes of joining the Western club, important lessons can be learned from the struggles of other former Soviet and Soviet-dominated countries that followed the same path.  In governance and wealth, an east-west divide lingers in the EUIt’s been over 15 years since Bulgaria and Romania, Eastern Europe’s newest EU member states, joined the bloc. The excitement of shrugging off their communist past ushered in a time of hopefulness and change. Yet, the reality remains complex.  Romania and Bulgaria witnessed a slow-but-steady rise in the standard of living. The same has been true in much of Eastern and Central Europe, where countries such as Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or the Baltic states have grown their economies significantly.  But Romania and Bulgaria have lagged in effecting broader reforms. A culture of clientelist politics and fraud has marred the overall picture. For both countries, much-needed overhauls of the judicial systems still have yet to be accomplished. This reality is likely to make future EU enlargement a much stricter affair.   Within the EU, an east-west divide lingers. Bulgaria continues to be EU’s poorest member, followed by Romania, both light years away from their significantly richer Western counterparts.  16 June 2022, Ukraine, Irpin: Oleksiy Chernyshov (l-r), Ukrainian President Selensky's special envoy for an EU accession perspective, walks with Emmanuel Macron, President of France, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) and Mario Draghi, Prime Minister of Italy, past destroyed buildings in Irpin, Greater Kiev.

Romania ($699 per inhabitant) and Bulgaria ($662) spend significantly less on their medical systems than all other EU countries, according to 2019 EU statistics. (By comparison, top performers such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Denmark, spend more than $5200 on health per citizen each year.)  Unity and liberalism in the face of warBut despite its economic woes, Eastern Europe has behaved admirably in handling the Ukrainian crisis. Calls to help Ukraine have echoed around the world, but in this region, action has been swift.  Ukraine’s neighbors have led the way in welcoming refugees and offering assistance. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Eastern European nations top the list of countries committing aid to Ukraine, as a share of their own gross domestic product The small Baltic nation of Estonia has offered the most to Ukraine by GDP share; Latvia ranks second. Both dwarfed Germany by more than tenfold.  The nations of Eastern Europe are also among those pushing for a firm line on Russia. A debate has emerged in Western circles as to how this war – and Russian President Vladimir Putin – should be approached. On one side, some say the West will have to live with Russia long term, the war will end faster if Putin is offered an off-ramp, and it’s best not to “humiliate” Russia in a way that could sow future conflict, as French President Emmanuel Macron argued. Others, including US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have said Russia should be thoroughly defeated. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, especially, has emerged as a strong voice in the latter camp.  Eastern European countries have also been sending critical weapons (including howitzers) to help Kyiv’s forces. These shipments come as Ukraine implores its friends for more help, as calls to send more and heavier weapons grow louder, and as Germany’s government in particular faces internal criticism for not doing more.  It is this very push that is slowly changing the face of the European Union. Eastern Europe is at its vanguard. In short, it has proven to be a moral leader in this crisis.   Hurdles aheadBut it’s not all rainbows and sunshine.   The eastern wing of the EU has its own differences to mend, Hungary being the top example. The populist government in Budapest, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, has been pushing for chummy relations with Putin.  Fortunately, Hungary remains an outlier, but its potential to disrupt EU affairs is significant. As Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, explained to the Financial Times: “Because of how the EU works, even if Hungary is a small member state, Russia and China have a prospect of almost having a seat at the decision-making table in Brussels.”   Hungary’s ability to hold the EU captive was last seen when the 27-nation bloc tried to cut Russian oil purchases. Only after weeks of negotiations did the EU manage to enact sanctions, while exempting Hungary from the embargo.

DANIEL LEAL/AFP/Getty ImagesYou asked, we answered: How to help Ukrainian refugeesMoldova a case in point What challenges might lie ahead for Ukraine, as it hopes to join the Western club?  As a useful case in point, we can look to tiny Moldova, which has similar ambitions. The former Soviet republic, sandwiched between Ukraine and the EU, has recently been making headlines over the risk of getting caught in Russia’s crosshairs. Moldova applied to join the EU along with Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s latest aggression. But corruption and an unreformed judicial system are very much dashing Moldova’s hope.  The European Commission has been sounding the alarm over the country’s rampant corruption for quite some time. In addition to the overhaul of its governance, Moldova needs a drastic break with the oligarchic system, wherein rich and powerful people like Vladimir Plahotniuc, Anatolie Stati, Ilan Shor have made names for themselves.  The good news is that if Moldova and other aspiring nations manage to curb corruption and enact reforms, joining the EU will provide them with much-needed resources to further develop. For example, Romania and Bulgaria managed to absorb tens of billions of euros from Brussels – money used to build new infrastructure and expand their economies.   EU membership has helped Eastern European countries stay on track. For future members, that looms as an added benefit. This is particularly significant for my home country of Romania, where European Commission supervision has helped keep up a functioning rule-of-law system.  Can Ukraine ever be part of the group?The spotlight is on Eastern Europe now and is expected to remain so for a while.   The attention plays in Moldova’s and Ukraine’s favor. Besides their strategic importance, the EU needs their softer assets: It needs the heroism Ukrainians have shown as much as it needs Moldova’s compassion in receiving the largest number of war refugees of any country in relation to its population size.  That said, it’s unlikely Ukraine could join the EU as things stand currently. As France’s Macron put it, it would likely take decades for Ukraine’s EU bid to be approved. (Rather, Macron suggested, a “parallel European community” should be considered, presumably with less-strict membership criteria.) Unfortunately, Macron is right: Ukraine is a ways off from reaching EU levels of good governance.   But this crisis has indeed shifted the EU’s center of gravity to the east, and for good reasons.   The region is coming of age politically. Thirty years after the fall of communism and 18 years after post-Soviet states began joining the EU, Eastern Europe now understands how to navigate the EU’s complex institutions. Eastern Europeans hold an almost tragic sense of history, which gives them a better understanding of what could come next, as a war unfolds next door. Its economies are growing, and its leaders have a desire to stand up to aggressors and bullies like Russia and China. The Baltics, in particular, can boast strong stances against Putin and integration with NATO.  Over the past months, Eastern European politicians have strengthened ties with Taiwan and called for tougher sanctions against Russia, all the while showing ever greater attachment to the transatlantic relationship.  Whether the rest of the EU can learn from all of this remains to be seen. What is certain, though, is that a stronger Eastern Europe is better for the EU and the entire free world.  This article has been updated to reflect the news that European Union leaders granted Ukraine candidate status.

Video Ad FeedbackExclusive joint interview with key House Republican leaders    09:44   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      Two leading House Republicans have called on President Joe Biden to increase military support to Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion and reiterated support on both sides of the aisle for continuing to fund the Ukrainian war effort.  Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “State of the Union” in a joint interview with House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner that aired Sunday that bipartisan support for Ukraine is “still very strong.”   But as the one-year anniversary of the war approaches, McCaul warned that hedging support for Ukraine could prolong the conflict, which could play into Russia’s advantages and allow anti-Ukraine dissent to build.  “The longer (Biden administration officials) drag this out, they play into (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin’s hands. He wants this to be a long, protracted war because he knows that potentially, he will lose – we could lose the will of the American people and therefore the Congress,” the Texas Republican told CNN, speaking from the Munich Security Conference in Germany.   CNNUkraine is burning through ammunition faster than the US and NATO can produce it. Inside the Pentagon's plan to close the gapThe US and its allies have already sent nearly $50 billion in aid and equipment to Ukraine’s military over the past year. To keep that up, and to rebuild its own stockpiles, the Pentagon is racing to re-arm, embarking on the biggest increase in ammunition production in decades and putting portions of the US defense industry on a war-footing despite America technically not being at war.  Asked by Brown if he believes the US is considering sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, McCaul replied, “I hope so,” and reiterated his concern over a drawn-out conflict between Russia and Ukraine while noting, “I think the momentum is building for this to happen.”  “The fact is, the longer they wait, the longer this conflict will prevail,” McCaul said.  US Sen. Lindsey Graham echoed that message, telling ABC in an interview that aired Sunday that US lawmakers attending the Munich Security Conference were in “virtually unanimous belief” that the US should begin training Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets.  “I believe a decision will be imminent when we get back to Washington, that the administration will start training Ukrainian pilots on the F-16. They need the weapons system,” Graham said.  Asked by CNN whether the Biden administration has ruled out sending F-16s to Ukraine, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said officials were “working very closely and directly with the Ukrainians on identifying what their needs are and when they need them.”  Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the United Nations (UN), speaks during an interview in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2023. Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration and its allies are working to isolate Russia at the global body, and called for reform to the Security Council to blunt Moscow's impact. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesUS ambassador to the UN says China would cross 'red line' by providing lethal aid to Russia“We’re also working to ensure that they have the training and the capacity to use whatever weapon systems we provide for them. So, this discussion is continuing,” she said in a separate interview on “State of the Union.”  Turner, an Ohio Republican, defended congressional support for Ukraine despite several of his fellow House GOP colleagues co-signing a “Ukraine Fatigue” resolution calling for the US to end military and financial aid to the country. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CNN last week he opposes the resolution.   Turner equated the resolution to a letter more than two dozen progressive House Democrats sent the White House last fall, asking it to pursue diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine. The letter was retracted shortly after.   “You have a handful on both sides, both sides, Pamela, who have been cautious or who have said that they don’t support, or they want support to come to an end,” he said from Munich. “There are 435 members of Congress. There are probably 400 that are for continuing this direction and this path.”Suspected Chinese spy balloonMcCaul also told CNN that the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that flew over US airspace before being shot down off the coast of South Carolina earlier this month contained parts manufactured in the United States and urged the US to restrict the flow of weapons technology to China.   “This balloon, by the way, had a lot of American parts in it. We know that the hypersonic missile that went around the world with precision was built on the backbone of American technology,” McCaul said, referring to Beijing’s test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in 2021.

But we don’t have to sell them the very technology they can put in their advanced weapons systems to then turn against either Taiwan in the Pacific or eventually, possibly the United States of America. I think there’s great bipartisanship on this issue,” he added.   Turner and McCaul also said they want to see Biden take a more serious position toward China following the a balloon incident.   McCaul said that the tension between the two countries “is very high right now” and that both Democrats and Republicans are aligned in wanting to confront Chinese threats.  “I think we have a unique opportunity to be bipartisan on this issue of national security against one of the greatest threats to this country, and the world, for that matter,” McCaul said.  Turner, meanwhile, said there is an opportunity for the Biden administration to “get back to a normal dialogue with China.”  “No one, of course, wants a cold war, but that isn’t the issue. What we want is a China that is not going to be an aggressor state, that’s not going to be building up its military and threatening the United States, and certainly not making the negative comments that it’s making instead of just openly apologizing for sending a spy balloon over our most sensitive military sites,” Turner said.  Adding to the tension between Washington and Beijing, the US has recently begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines in China’s support for Russia’s military, and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught, US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN.  The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the last several days.  “The most catastrophic thing that could happen to US-China relationship, in my opinion, is for China to give lethal weapons to (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin and his crime against humanity,” Graham told ABC.  “If you jump on the Putin train now, you’re dumber than dirt. It would be like buying a ticket on the Titanic after you saw the movie. Don’t do this,” he said.   This story has been updated with additional information.

China’s property crash is prompting banks to offer mortgages to 70-year-olds    			By Laura He, CNN		  Updated  1:52 AM EST, Mon February 20, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackChina's once vibrant private sector suffocating under Xi's crackdown    03:20   - Source:CNNHong KongCNN      The property market in China is so depressed that some banks are resorting to drastic measures, including allowing people to pay off mortgages until they are 95 years old.  Some banks in the cities of Nanning, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Beijing have extended the upper age limit on mortgages to between 80 and 95, according to a number of state media reports. That means people aged 70 can now take out loans with maturities of between 10 and 25 years.  China’s property market is in the midst of a historic downturn. New home prices had fallen for 16 straight months through December. Sales by the country’s top 100 developers last year were only 60% of 2021 levels.  The new age limits, which aren’t yet official national policy, aim to breathe life into the country’s moribund property market while taking into consideration China’s rapidly aging population, said Yan Yuejin, a property analyst at E-House China Holdings, a real estate services firm, in a recent research note.  “Basically, it’s a policy tool to stimulate housing demand, as it can alleviate the debt payment burden and encourage home buying,” he added.  The new mortgage terms are like a “relay loan.” If the elderly borrower isn’t able to repay, his or her children must carry on with the mortgage, he said.   Last month, China reported that its population shrank in 2022 for the first time in more than 60 years, a new milestone in the country’s deepening demographic crisis with significant implications for its slowing economy. The number of people aged 60 or above increased to 280 million by the end of last year, or 19.8% of the population.  The mortgage borrower’s age plus mortgage length should not usually exceed 70 years, according to previous rules published by the banking regulator. China’s average life expectancy is around 78.  The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission hasn’t commented publicly about the new terms.Multi-generational loansBut bank branches across the country are setting their own terms on these multi-generational loans.   According to the Beijing News, a branch of Bank of Communications in the city said borrowers as old as 70 can take out home loans lasting 25 years, which means the upper age limit on its mortgages has been lifted to 95.  But there are also prerequisites: The mortgage needs to be guaranteed by the borrower’s children, and their combined monthly income must be at least twice the monthly mortgage payment.   Separately, a branch of Citic Bank has extended the upper age limit on its mortgages to 80, the paper said, citing a bank client manager.  Calls to the Beijing branches of Citic Bank and Bank of Communications were not answered.  Hong Hao, chief economist at Grow Investment Group, said this was a “drastic” measure and “could be a marketing gimmick to attract the elderly to pay [mortgages] for the younger generation.”   Yan from E-House said the main beneficiary of the move might not be the elderly, but middle-aged borrowers between 40 and 59. Under the extended payment cutoff age, those people could get a mortgage for 30 years — the maximum length allowed in China.   Compared with previous terms, it means those borrowers could pay less each month.  “It is obviously a way to alleviate the debt payment burden,” said Hong.   According to calculations by E-House, if a bank extends the upper age limit to 80, borrowers aged from 40 to 59 can get 10 additional years on their mortgages. Assuming their mortgage is one million yuan ($145,416), then their monthly payment can be reduced by 1,281 yuan ($186), or 21%.

Last summer, protests that erupted in dozens of cities were staged by people refusing to pay mortgages on unfinished homes, dealing a further blow to market sentiment.  Authorities have rolled out a flurry of stimulus measures to try to revive the housing market, including several cuts to lending rates and measures to ease the liquidity crisis for developers — so that they can resume stalled construction and deliver pre-sold homes to buyers as quickly as possible.Risky mortgages?Other than Beijing, some banks in Nanning, the provincial capital of Guangxi province, have raised the upper age limit on mortgages to 80, according to the city’s official newspaper Nanguo Zaobao.In the eastern cities of Ningbo and Hangzhou, several local lenders are advertising age limits of 75 or 80, a relaxation from previous rules, according to reports by government-owned Ningbo Daily and Hangzhou Daily.“If the applicant is too old to meet the loan requirement, they can have their children as the guarantor,” a lender was quoted as saying.

The impact will be felt around the worldBut Wang Yuchen, a real estate lawyer at Beijing Jinsu Law Firm, warned such mortgages were “risky.”  It’s understandable that many cities are trying to revive their housing markets by reducing the monthly debt payment and enlisting more elderly people into the pool of home buyers, he said in a written commentary on his WeChat account.  “But the elderly have relatively poor repayment ability. On the one hand, it could affect their quality of life in old age, as they continue carrying the mortgage debt mountain and work for the bank until the last moment of their lives,” he said. “On the other hand, the associated risks may be transferred to their children, increasing their financial pressure.”  “For some home buyers, choosing this way to purchase a house is probably because of their lack of funds. But it’s risky to do so at this time,” he said, adding that the property market is in a structural downturn and the government is still working to curb speculation.

Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov docks in Durban, South Africa, en route to scheduled naval exercises with the South African and Chinese navies.Rogan Ward/ReutersJohannesburg, South AfricaCNN      As the anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine approaches, a Russian warship armed with one of Moscow’s most powerful weapons pulled into a port on South Africa’s east coast this weekend.  The frigate Admiral Gorshkov – carrying hypersonic Zircon missiles, according to President Putin – has a “Z” and “V” crudely painted in white on its blackened smokestack, just like the Russian tanks and artillery pieces that rolled into Ukraine a year ago.   It is participating in a 10-day naval exercise in the Indian Ocean alongside South African and Chinese warships, war games that South Africa says have long been planned.  But the timing of the exercises has Western diplomats privately incensed and publicly critical, and they risk an embarrassing backlash for the government in Pretoria.  “The timing of these exercises is particularly unfortunate and will focus the world’s attention on South Africa during the anniversary of the war. I don’t think Western nations are going to let this one slide,” said Steven Gruzd, head of the African Governance and Diplomacy Program at the South African Institute of International Affairs.   “It is very disturbing, that South Africa is hosting a military exercise with the country – an aggressor, invader – that is using its military force against a peaceful country, bringing destruction and trying to eliminate the Ukrainian Nation,” said Liubov Abravitova, Ukraine’s ambassador to Southern Africa.   On the basis of realpolitik alone, freezing out Russia or, at the very least, postponing the naval exercises, may have seemed like a smarter choice.  Ukraine’s biggest supporters, the United States and countries in the European Union, are also big trade partners for South Africa.  European Union and US two-way trade with South Africa outstrips Russian economic ties many times over. And though Russia promises more trade deals, its battered economy is unlikely to provide the direct investment that South Africa desperately needs.  South African officials also point to drills held with the French and US militaries in recent years.

And to us Ukraine what we call a sell-out. It is selling out to the west,” said Obey Mabena, a veteran of the ANC’s armed wing in an interview last year with CNN.  While Mabena doesn’t represent the government or the ANC, his sentiment is likely shared by more than a few ANC stalwarts.  Mabena fled South Africa in the 1970s, like many in his generation, driven out by the police brutality of apartheid South Africa. In exile, many South African youth joined the armed wing of liberation movements like the ANC and Pan Africanist Congress.

REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovMaxim Shemetov/ReutersOpinion: Break up the Vladimir Putin-Xi Jinping 'no limits' partnershipThere were often Soviet advisers at their training camps in other African countries.  “We found that there is a country like the Soviet bloc that was ready to give us everything that we needed. Give us food, they gave us uniforms, they trained us, they gave us weapons,” said Mabena, “For the first time we came across White people who treated us as equals.”  Liberation fighters and politicians have a very different experience with the West.  The US government only supported comprehensive economic sanctions in mid-1980s – decades after the apartheid regime took power.  Anti-apartheid activist and South Africa’s first Black president, Nelson Mandela was on a terror watchlist until 2008 – a holdover from Cold War. Many ANC members are convinced that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had a hand in Mandela’s capture, something that has never been proven.  Of course, many of the ANC cadres went to Soviet-era Ukraine for their education and training.  And the anti-apartheid movement had some of its most powerful allies in the US. In Congress, then-senator Joe Biden famously lambasted Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state for backing the White South African government.   Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (left) and South African counterpart Naledi Pandor meeti in Pretoria on January 23, 2023.Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty Imaages    Negotiations, not armsIn recent years, South Africa’s links to Russia have only deepened with the formation of BRICS, the economic and diplomatic partnership of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.   Backing out of the joint naval exercises would have been an insult to Russia, but likely also to China, a far more important economic partner. China’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed its participation in the naval exercises in a statement Sunday, saying the drills would promote defense and security cooperation among BRICS members.  South African’s chief diplomat called some of the criticism of the naval exercises a “double-standard.”   Like several African nations, South Africa has abstained from UN General Assembly votes to condemn Russia’s invasion and the annexation of Ukrainian territory.   “The response we got is you can take it or leave it. And in the face of that arrogance, we thought the only decision we could take was to abstain,” Naledi Pandor, minister of international relations and cooperation, told CNN in June.   She maintains that the goal for the global community should be a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine under the authority of the United Nations. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has offered to mediate in those talks.   Neither side has taken him up on the offer. But South Africa’s stance on the war has hardly frozen out the country. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and other senior US diplomats have all visited South Africa since the start of the war.  Perhaps mindful of the history, America’s senior diplomats are careful not to criticize South Africa by name.  But if South African officials believe their stance is the pragmatic approach, it is difficult to argue that it is the moral one. Certainly with a pedigree of moral giants like Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu – the late Archbishop of Cape Town whose foundation said this was no time to “sit on the fence.”  Pretoria may come under even more criticism if, as rumored, Russia test-fires a hypersonic Zircon missile from the frigate Admiral Gorshkov during the naval exercises.  The missiles are long-range weapons that travel more than five times the speed of sound and are harder to detect and intercept than other missiles.  Putin has previously boasted about them. “It has no analogues in any country in the world,” he said, according to TASS. “I am sure that such powerful weapons will reliably protect Russia from potential external threats and will help ensure the national interests of our country,” he added.  Showing them off in the joint drills could be another propaganda highlight for the Russian leader, whose weapons haven’t lived up to expectations in the Ukraine war.  And by staying assiduously “neutral,” South Africa could be handing Putin a significant win on the anniversary of the war.     “They are going to milk this. Russia is going to use this as a propaganda tool and the message is ‘we have friends, we have cooperation,’” Gruzd said.

The state of Florida ranked as the most vulnerable region outside of China.  Climate risk specialists XDI assessed more than 2,600 regions worldwide, using climate models together with weather and environmental data to assess the economic damage that temperature rises could cause by 2050.  The study is based on a 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperatures by the end of the century, under a scenario drawn up by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The data showed that some of the engine rooms of the global economy face catastrophic hazards such as rising sea levels, river flooding and wildfires, which could also lower property prices and deter investment, XDI said.  YANCHENG, CHINA - OCTOBER 3, 2022 - Various tidal trenches formed by tidal washout are seen in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, China, on Oct 3, 2022. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesSome Chinese cities break October heat records as others shiverThe Chinese coastal province of Jiangsu, which is heavily industrialized and accounts for a tenth of China’s GDP, was ranked the world’s most vulnerable territory, followed by neighboring Shandong and the major steel production base of Hebei. The flood-prone central province of Henan was fourth.  The shift of global manufacturing to Asia has driven a substantial increase in infrastructure investment in already vulnerable regions throughout China, making it more susceptible to the impacts of climate change, Hamden said.  “Infrastructure investment has tended to be concentrated in areas that have traditionally been very high-risk - river deltas, coastal zones, and relatively flat areas,” he said.  The highest ranking non-Chinese region was Florida in 10th place, with California 19th, Texas 20th and New York 46th. Nine territories from India were also in the top 50.  While climate is likely to become increasingly decisive when it comes to determining the flow of capital, it remains to be seen whether it will deter investment in more vulnerable regions, said Karl Mallon, XDI’s co-founder.  “There is a lot to be done to work out which areas in the world are potentially adaptable and defendable, and which are probably the areas we will see abandoned in due course,” he said.

But we also have to be clear that if there are any thoughts and efforts by the Chinese and others to provide lethal support to the Russians in their brutal attack against Ukraine, that that is unacceptable,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “State of the Union.”  “That would be a red line,” she said.

The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the past several days.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the issue when he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, officials said.  “The secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,” a senior State Department official told reporters.  Thomas-Greenfield also reiterated Sunday that the US is prepared to “compete” with China.   “The president has said we see China as the adversary it is. We are prepared to compete with the Chinese, and we are [prepared], when necessary, to confront the Chinese. And that’s what we’re doing. And that’s what we will continue to do to ensure that our national interests are always at the forefront,” she said.     CNN’s Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.

Video Ad FeedbackRussian mothers gather to send Putin a message about their sons fighting in war    01:57   - Source:CNNEditor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.CNN      When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, dictator Joseph Stalin was too shocked to speak in public for nearly two weeks.    On July 3, he finally gave a radio speech, trying to reassure his nation — already suffering serious battlefield losses to the German blitzkrieg — with the words, “History shows that there are no invincible armies.”  Germany’s “Operation Barbarossa” involved more than 3 million troops, about 3,000 tanks and 2,500 aircraft — one of the largest invasion forces in history. Expecting to conquer Moscow within weeks, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler thought the Soviet regime would quickly disintegrate. Over the next four years though, Hitler’s armies proved to be anything but invincible.  One year ago, Stalin’s heir in the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin, launched an army — one that he likely thought was invincible — into Ukraine, aiming to quickly decapitate its leadership and seize Kyiv. His hopes were frustrated by Ukraine’s spirited defense under President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the two nations continue to be locked in a savage conflict.   Contrary to what most people expected before the war, it’s a stalemate, observed retired US General David Petraeus, in a Q&A with CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. So how does the Russian leader look a year after his decision?   “Putin has earned a failing grade to date,” said Petraeus, who commanded the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. “Let’s recall that the first and most important task of a strategic leader is to ‘get the big ideas right’ — that is, to get the overall strategy and fundamental decisions right. Putin clearly has failed abysmally in that task, resulting in a war that has made him and his country a pariah, set back the Russian economy by a decade or more (losing many of Russia’s best and brightest, and prompting over 1,200 western companies to leave Russia or reduce operations there), done catastrophic damage to the Russian military and its reputation and put his legacy in serious jeopardy.”   Clay JonesStill, it would be a mistake to underestimate Russia, Petraeus noted, citing a maxim often attributed, perhaps wrongly, to Stalin: “Quantity has a quality of its own.”   During World War II, the Soviet Union’s ability to call on vast reserves and sustain enormous casualties, despite having inferior tanks and planes, helped it to defeat Germany.   Today, Russia’s population is more than three times the size of Ukraine’s and it can afford to send more soldiers into the fight. But in Ukraine’s case there’s an intangible factor. “Ukrainians know what they are fighting for,” Petraeus noted, “while it is not clear that the same is true of many of the Russian soldiers, a disproportionate number of whom are from ethnic and sectarian minorities in the Russian Federation.”Lives disrupted and destroyedDiliara DidenkoOn February 23, 2022, Diliara Didenko, went to bed in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, “thinking that I would celebrate my husband’s birthday the next day. Our life was getting better. My husband was running his own business. Our daughter had started school and made friends there. We were lucky to have arranged support services and found a special needs nursery for our son. I finally had time to work. I felt happy.”  She had no inkling that the outbreak of war would force her to restart her life in the Czech Republic within 22 days.   “Completely exhausted, crushed and scared, we had to brace ourselves and come to terms with our forced displacement. I will be forever grateful to all those who helped us come to Prague and adjust to a new life in a foreign land.” Didenko’s is one story among the tens of millions of lives displaced, disrupted or cut short by the war.

On quiet summer evenings, she would “sit outside the MSU Dairy Store licking an ice cream cone … I was safe in this community where we looked out for one another. I had space to run and play, to grow and imagine and learn.”  “Since moving away from home, those childhood memories have moored me to the place where I grew up, where life felt simple and the world felt kind,” she observed. “On Monday night, when news broke that there was an active shooter on Michigan State’s campus, I clung to those memories.”  Goldynia’s mother was among those locked down for hours when a shooter killed three people and injured five more. The news alarmed those on campus and rippled out to the enormous alumni network of MSU, which has about 50,000 current students.   “I think about the words Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer spoke on Tuesday morning — ‘Our Spartan community is reeling today’ — and I wonder if the ‘reeling’ ever ends and, if it does, what comes afterward,” Goldynia wrote.  In the Detroit Free Press, Jemele Hill, who graduated from MSU, wrote, “What happened … is a reminder that the regularity of these acts is bringing violence even closer to all of us. Some of the students whom Americans saw struggling to process what happened had already lived through another mass shooting — in Oxford, or Newtown, Conn. Many of the students who fled certain buildings on campus the night of the shooting were just following the protocols they’d been taught prior to coming to Michigan State, because teaching children and young adults how not to be killed in mass shootings is now a staple of America’s egregious routine.”   For more on guns:   Jens Ludwig and Chico Tillmon: There’s no safety net to catch the young men at highest risk of gun violenceBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency    Nikki Haley jumps inNow there’s more than one. For months, former President Donald Trump was the only candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. This week, Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the UN, entered the fray, saying, “We are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into the future.”  As SE Cupp noted, Haley called for going beyond the “faded names of the past” and argued for term limits for members of Congress and “mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.”  Trump is 76 and President Joe Biden is 80.  But the real question, in Cupp’s view, is this: “Will Haley also bring substantively different views that appeal to younger generations?” “Will she break with the election denialism, grievance politics, white nationalism and conspiracy theories that Trumpism allowed?” And, Cupp added, where will Haley stand on immigration, gun control, climate change, abortion and other issues that particularly resonate with younger voters?

As Jill Filipovic pointed out, the jurors, who likely included some Trump voters, “were asked to assess whether it’s possible that a former president and his allies had leveraged an attack on American democracy, or whether that president was telling the truth when he said the election was stolen.”  In a unanimous conclusion, “they found that, contrary to the former president’s claims, there was no evidence of widespread fraud undermining the results of the election, and that at least some criminal charges should be brought.”Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook “If average people selected for a special grand jury can complete this task with honesty and integrity, surely it’s not asking too much for Republican officeholders to approach their roles with similar gravity: To declare that the election was free and fair, and to ask that those who may have broken the law or lied be held accountable,” wrote Filipovic.   A court filing the same day in the libel lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News revealed more damning information. Writing in CNN’s Reliable Sources newsletter, Oliver Darcy observed, “Despite what the right-wing talk channel peddled to its millions of loyal viewers in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election, behind the scenes its most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives privately trashed claims of election fraud.” More questions than answersNTSBGov/ReutersThe derailment that left 20 cars of hazardous materials in the village of East Palestine, Ohio, more than two weeks ago is still a huge concern for residents seeking answers.    Judith A. Lennington, a factory worker turned book author and a longtime resident, saw the effects of the disaster from her farm three miles away.  “The cloud that went up in the sky was like nothing I’ve ever seen in my life,” she told CNN Opinion’s Stephanie Griffith. “It looked like a huge black cloud with a tornado coming down from it. It was just awful. After the accident, we put quilts over the doors and over the windows, sealed the cracks and just stayed inside.”   “I can still smell it outside. Luckily the fumes are not strong here — the wind blows in the other direction — but I can, still, if I go from the house to the garage, I can feel my eyes burning. And I lose my voice after a while…”  “So I don’t know what’s going to happen. Is it safe to let your children go out and walk in that grass? Is it safe to let your pets go to the bathroom on the grass and then come back in your house? If your water is safe, what about those ponds where the train wreck is?”  Seeking helpThe newly elected Sen. John Fetterman checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Thursday for treatment of “clinical depression,” his chief of staff announced. Fetterman, recovering from a stroke during his campaign last year, deserves credit for seeking help and being open about it, wrote psychologist Peggy Drexler.   “We’re right to want to know about the health issues facing our leaders and the steps they’re taking to get the help they need, but it’s important to remember that millions of Americans battle depression and lead highly productive, successful lives. … We’re living in tough times, and almost everybody hurts; if our leaders are meant to represent us, how can we possibly fault them for being, in fact, just like us?” Balloon mysteriesPhil Hands/Tribune Content AgencyThe episode of the Chinese balloon was followed by an even stranger one: US fighter jets shot down three more objects of so-far unknown origin over the US and Canada. President Biden spoke about the shootdowns for the first time on Thursday, saying that there was no indication the last three were connected to the balloon from China, which US officials said was intended for surveillance.   In January, as Peter Bergen noted, the US intelligence community reported that “the number of UFO sightings significantly increased between March 2021 and August 2022, during which time 247 new sightings were reported, mostly by US Navy and Air Force pilots and personnel. That’s almost double the 144 UFO sightings reported in the 17-year period between 2004 to 2021.” Could the spate of unexplained aircraft have any relation to the ones that were shot down?   “Congress should convene hearings to get to the bottom of this,” Bergen wrote.  “The public has a right to understand why objects are flying around in American airspace that the Pentagon and the US intelligence community can’t identify.”   For more:   Julian Zelizer: Biden’s ‘no apologies’ speech should silence his critics. Drew Sheneman/Tribune Content Agency    Stalin’s daughterPhoto 12/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty ImagesSvetlana was Joseph Stalin’s “beloved daughter,” Rosemary Sullivan wrote. “Stalin called her his little hostess, little fly, little sparrow. She was the only one who could stop his rages against her mother by wrapping her arms around his Cossack boots.”  But when a considerably older Soviet filmmaker wooed the 16-year-old Svetlana, her father’s reaction was fierce: he sent him to the Gulag for 10 years. “This was when Svetlana began to understand who her father was. Her status as beloved was conditional.”   Her story has new resonance now that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un appears to be “grooming his daughter to carry on his dynasty. North Korea just released a new postage stamp carrying photos of the dictator and his ‘beloved daughter’ standing together watching the test-firing of the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile,” Sullivan noted.  “Will she, like Svetlana, inherit her father’s will but reject his murderous legacy? Or will she prove a well-trained apprentice and possibly become more dangerous than her father?”The Taylor Swiftiness of it allJohannes VermeerThe last thing Euny Hong expected to be doing was panicking about getting tickets to an art exhibit. But then she read what she called the “sadistic” headline a “sadistic” friend posted on Facebook:   “There will never be a Vermeer exhibit as great as this one.”   “In the entire world, there are only 35 known paintings by the 17th-century Dutch master, whose legendary use of texture and light, particularly in the portrayal of women in their everyday lives, positions him among the greatest painters of all time,” Hong wrote. The much-anticipated exhibit at Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum features “28 of his works, including ‘Girl with a Pearl Earring,’ which, by the way, is only on display through March.”  “It was the words ‘there will never be’ that sent me into a frenzy of obsessively refreshing the museum’s web page like a lab rat pushing a heroin lever. The site alternated between crashing and displaying a message that they were ‘temporarily’ suspending ticket sales. And here I thought my lack of Taylor Swift fandom would save me from such indignities!”   Happy ending: Hong landed the tickets.Don’t missLisa Benson/GoComics.comSophia A.

So when spring training games begin later this week, there will be one revolutionary change: a time clock to force pitchers to spend less time between throws.   “For more than 150 years, the lack of a clock on the field has distinguished baseball from other major US team sports, and some baseball purists are sure to object to adding one,” wrote Frederic J. Frommer.   There’s a precedent of sorts. In the early 1950s, interest in professional basketball was declining, prompting the league to introduce a shot clock. “The impact was immediate: average team scoring per game increased from 79 points to 93. That figure rose to 106 by 1958, and not coincidentally, attendance soared by 40%.”  “People don’t come to games to watch guys stand around and do nothing — whether it’s on a basketball court or a baseball diamond,” Frommer observed. “A clock won’t have the same dramatic effect on baseball that it had on the NBA. But for Americans with limitless entertainment options and limited time, it will help attract fans with more exciting (and faster) baseball games than we’ve seen in years.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    OpinionAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

He has the full support of his family and his medical team,” the statement said.  Jason Carter, a onetime Democratic state senator in Georgia and the former president’s grandson, said he visited Friday with his grandparents and that “they are at peace and – as always – their home is full of love.”  Jimmy Carter_Willie Nelson_photo courtesy of Jimmy Carter Presidential Library_Jimmy Carter Presidential Librarygallery    The making of a rock and roll presidentJimmy Carter, who turned 98 last year, became the oldest living US president in history after the passing of George H.W. Bush, who died in late 2018 at 94. The nation’s 39th president has kept a low public profile in recent years due to the coronavirus pandemic but has continued to speak out about risks to democracy around the world, a longtime cause of his.  Carter beat brain cancer in 2015 but faced a series of health scares in 2019, and consequentially underwent surgery to remove pressure on his brain. His health woes forced him to give up his decadeslong tradition of teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia.   A peanut farmer and US Navy lieutenant before going into politics, Carter, a Democrat, eventually served one term as governor of Georgia and president of the United States from 1977 to 1981.  The former president is widely revered for his championing of human rights. His brokering of the Camp David Accords in 1978 with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin remains central to his legacy.

The center has worked to advance democracy by monitoring foreign elections and reducing diseases in developing countries over the years.   Carter himself has been a longtime volunteer with Habitat for Humanity.  He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to push for peace across the globe.  President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat and longtime admirer of Carter, has been advised of the former president’s declining health and his decision to seek hospice care, an official told CNN.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)Evan Vucci/APThe Bidens visit the Carters in GeorgiaThe Bidens traveled to Georgia to visit the Carters in 2021 – on the 100th day of Biden’s presidency.   Biden was one of the first US senators to endorse Carter in his 1976 presidential bid, according to the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.   Carter was in touch with President Donald Trump and his administration multiple times during the Republican’s time in office.  In 2018, Carter said he received a briefing on North Korea and said he’d be willing to travel to the country on the Trump administration’s behalf. He also wrote Trump a letter on US-China trade relations and spoke with him by phone in April 2019.   While the White House referred to the call as a “very good telephone conversation” and said that Trump “has always liked President Carter,” the relationship deteriorated later that year when the Georgia Democrat called for a full investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and suggested it “would show that Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016.” Carter later issued warnings about Trump’s decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Video Ad FeedbackReporter shares what Blinken and Chinese foreign minister discussed    01:57   - Source:CNNCNN      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi on Saturday, in the first face-to-face between senior US and Chinese officials since the US military shot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon earlier this month.  In a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Blinken “directly spoke to the unacceptable violation of US sovereignty and international law” and said incidents like the balloon, which hovered over US airspace for days before the US shot it down off the coast of South Carolina, “must never occur again,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.  Blinken, who a senior State Department official characterized as “very direct and candid throughout,” began the hourlong meeting by stating “how unacceptable and irresponsible” it was that China had flown the balloon into US airspace. The secretary later expressed disappointment that Beijing had not engaged in military-to-military dialogue when the Chinese balloon incident occurred, the senior official told reporters.

We think that’s unfortunate. And that is not the way that our two sides ought to be conducting business,” the official said.    There was “no formal agreement” reached, however, on any kind of mechanism to increase dialogue between the two countries.   The diplomatic fallout from the balloon incident has been swift, with Washington accusing China of overseeing an extensive international surveillance program. Beijing has denied those claims, and in turn accused the US, without providing evidence, of flying balloons over its airspace without permission. China maintains that its balloon, which US forces identified and then downed earlier this month, was a civilian research aircraft accidentally blown off course.  Wang confirmed what he called an “informal” meeting with Blinken on Saturday and called on the US to repair the “damage” to the countries’ relations, according to a press release broadcast by CGTN, which is a Chinese state media outlet. Earlier, Wang had criticized the United States’ handling of the incident, calling the response “absurd and hysterical” and “100% an abuse of the use of force.”   The incident had an immediate impact on what had been seen as an opportunity for the US and China to stabilize relations. In early February, Blinken postponed an expected visit to Beijing, after the balloon – floating over the US in plain sight – dominated media headlines and public attention.  The visit would have been the first to China by a US secretary of state since 2018, on the heels of a relatively amicable face-to-face between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in November.  Biden said Thursday that he expects to speak with Xi about the balloon but that he will not apologize for shooting it down. “I hope we are going to get to the bottom of this, but I make no apologies for taking down that balloon,” he said.  Blinken raised a possible conversation between Biden and Xi, according to the State Department official, who said US officials have not heard anything in recent days that would change the US assessment that the balloon was for Chinese surveillance.   “We haven’t heard anything that provides any kind of a credible explanation for what this balloon was. The US stands firmly behind our assessment,” the official said.

While expectations for substantial breakthroughs were low, Blinken’s trip was supposed to build a floor for fraught US-China relations and prevent tensions from veering into open conflict – guardrails intended to keep incidents like the suspected surveillance balloon from escalating into a full-blown diplomatic crisis.   CNN reported Wednesday that US intelligence officials are assessing the possibility that the balloon was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government and are examining whether it was diverted off course by strong winds, according to multiple people briefed on the intelligence.  Any intelligence suggesting that the balloon’s path into the US may have been unintentional could potentially ease tensions between the two nations.Visiting RussiaWang, who was named Xi’s top foreign policy adviser last month, has already visited France and Italy this week and is expected to visit Russia after the Munich conference.  The trip will be a test of Beijing’s attempt to strike a diplomatic balancing act between boosting relations with the West and maintaining close ties with Moscow.  Blinken and Wang on Saturday discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the US secretary of state warning “about the implications and consequences” if China increases its support for Russia’s war effort, according to Price’s readout of the meeting.  The senior State Department official told reporters that Blinken “was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion.”  US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN earlier Saturday that the US has recently begun seeing “disturbing” trendlines in China’s support for Russia’s military and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught.  Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris speaks at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Saturday, Feb. 18, 2023. The 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC) is taking place from Feb. 17 to Feb. 19, 2023 at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich. Michael Probst/APUS declares Russia has committed crimes against humanity in UkraineThose officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners in Munich over the last several days.  China’s relationship with Europe has come under significant stress in the wake of the Ukraine war. Beijing has refused to condemn the invasion outright or support numerous measures against it at the United Nations. China has also continued to partner with the Russian military during large-scale exercises, while boosting its trade and fuel purchases from Moscow.  According to China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wang’s visit to Moscow will provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and “exchange views” on “international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest” – a catch-all phrase often used to allude to topics, including the war in Ukraine.  The Foreign Ministry did not specify whether Wang would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  “China is ready to take this visit as an opportunity and work with Russia to promote steady growth of bilateral relations in the direction identified by the two heads of state, defend the legitimate rights and interests of both sides, and play an active role for world peace,” spokesman Wang Wenbin said.  Wang’s visit may also foreshadow a state visit by Xi to Moscow later this year. Putin extended an invitation to Xi during a customary end-of-year call between the two leaders, but China’s Foreign Ministry has yet to confirm any plans.  Blinken, who reiterated Saturday the US’ unchanging policy regarding Taiwan and “underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability” with the democratically ruled island, reinforced statements from Biden that the US does not seek a conflict with China but will continue to “stand up for our values.”  “The Secretary reiterated President Biden’s statements that the United States will compete and will unapologetically stand up for our values and interests, but that we do not want conflict with the PRC and are not looking for a new Cold War,” Price said in the statement. “The Secretary underscored the importance of maintaining diplomatic dialogue and open lines of communication at all times.”  This story has been updated with additional developments.

The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the last several days.   Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the issue when he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, officials said.   “The Secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,” a senior State Department official told reporters.  Vice President Kamala Harris also alluded to China’s support for Russia during her speech in Munich. Antony Blinken and Wang YiBlinken and Chinese counterpart meet in first face-to-face since spy balloon shot down“We are also troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with Moscow since the war began,” Harris said Saturday. “Looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing, and further undermine a rules-based order.”   Officials said the US is seeing China publicly trying to present itself as a proponent of peace – Wang said in Munich on Saturday that Beijing would be introducing a “peace plan” for Ukraine and Russia – and maintain relationships with Europe, while at the same time quietly aiding Russia’s war effort and considering the provision of lethal aid.   “This warfare cannot continue to rage on. We need to think about what efforts we can make to bring this warfare to an end,” Wang said at the conference.  CNN asked European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday whether she believed, after hearing Wang’s speech, that China is listening to Europe’s message to not support Russia. “The opposite,” she said, has been seen so far.   “We’ve seen that China and Russia signed an unlimited partnership, and I think we need more proof and more action to see that China is not supporting Russia,” she told CNN. “So far, we see the opposite. And therefore, there is an open question on the table.”  In a clip of an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” released on Saturday, Blinken said the US has been monitoring possible increased support for Russia from China “very closely” and has “made very clear” to Beijing the consequences of providing weapons or ammunition to the Kremlin.  “To date, we have seen Chinese companies – and, of course, in China there is really no distinction between private companies and the state – we have seen them provide non-lethal support to … Russia for use in the Ukraine,” Blinken said.  Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris speaks at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Saturday, Feb. 18, 2023. The 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC) is taking place from Feb. 17 to Feb. 19, 2023 at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich. Michael Probst/APUS declares Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine“The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support. And we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” he added.  As CNN previously reported, the Biden administration last month raised concerns with China about evidence it has suggesting that Chinese companies have sold non-lethal equipment to Russia for use in Ukraine, in an effort to ascertain how much Beijing knows about the transactions, according to two US officials.  That equipment has included items like flak jackets and helmets, multiple sources familiar with US and European intelligence told CNN. But China has stopped short of the more robust military assistance, like lethal weapons systems for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, that Russia has requested because it has not wanted to be seen as a pariah on the world stage, officials said.   But there are signs now that Beijing could now be considering it, the officials said, and Biden administration officials are warning publicly and privately that the US is monitoring closely for any violations of western sanctions prohibiting military support for Russia.   China and Russia publicly declared a “no-limits” friendship just before Russia invaded Ukraine last year, and Wang is set to visit Russia this month, CNN has reported.

Video Ad FeedbackUS formally accuses Russian forces of crimes against humanity    03:40   - Source:CNNCNN      The US government has determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity during its war in Ukraine, Vice President Kamala Harris announced Saturday in Germany.  “In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: These are crimes against humanity,” Harris said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference. She added, “To all those who have perpetrated these crimes, and to their superiors who are complicit in those crimes, you will be held to account.”  CNNUkraine is burning through ammunition faster than the US and NATO can produce it. Inside the Pentagon's plan to close the gapThe declaration marks the strongest accusation yet from the US as it seeks to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The US government declared last March that members of the Russian armed forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine. President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have said it was their personal opinion that war crimes have taken place and Biden has gone as far as saying that atrocities at the hands of Moscow’s troops qualify as “genocide.”Blinken echoed Harris’ remarks Saturday in a statement released by the State Department.  “We reserve crimes against humanity determinations for the most egregious crimes,” he said. “These acts are not random or spontaneous; they are part of the Kremlin’s widespread and systematic attack against Ukraine’s civilian population.”  While the latest crimes against humanity determination is significant, it remains largely symbolic for now. It does not immediately trigger any specific consequences, nor does it give the US the ability to prosecute the Russians involved with perpetrating crimes against humanity. However, it could provide international bodies such as the International Criminal Court, which work to hold perpetrators accountable, with evidence to effectively try to prosecute those crimes.Laying out the evidenceHarris’ announcement Saturday comes days before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The vice president is in Germany as a part of the Biden administration’s efforts to show commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and unity among Western allies who have provided billions in aid, funding and weapons to combat Russia’s aggression. Biden is scheduled to visit Poland on Monday.  Harris said Saturday that as a former prosecutor who began “as young lawyer in the court room and later running California’s Department of Justice,” she knew “firsthand the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law.”  Having escaped Russia in September, Chibrin has asked for asylum in a European country.Claudia Otto/CNN'There are maniacs who enjoy killing,' Russian defector says of his former unit accused of war crimes in BuchaIn her speech, delivered inside the famed Bayerischer Hof hotel in Munich, Harris laid bare some of what could be used as evidence of Russia’s crimes against humanity. The vice president outlined specific instances that have peppered news clips and official reports.  “First, from the starting days of this unprovoked war, we have witnessed Russian forces engage in horrendous atrocities and war crimes,” Harris said.  “Russian forces have pursued a widespread and systemic attack against a civilian population – gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape, and deportation. Execution-style killings, beating and electrocution,” she added. “Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine to Russia, including children. They have cruelly separated children from their families.”  Harris’ speech cited evidence of indiscriminate Russian attacks that deliberately targeted civilians, including the bombing of a maternity hospital that killed a pregnant mother and of a theater in Mariupol, where hundreds were killed. The vice president spoke of the horrific images out of Bucha that showed men and women shot and left to rot in the streets and reports by the United Nations of a 4-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by a Russian soldier.  “Barbaric and inhumane,” Harris said.

Bernat Armangue/APReport says Russian government is operating network of camps where it has held thousands of Ukrainian children since start of warSince 2022, the US has provided $30 million to support the investigation of war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine, according to a White House fact sheet. The Biden administration is seeking another nearly $30 million from Congress to bolster efforts on this issue.  As it was when the US government declared that Russia committed war crimes last March, it remains to be seen whether there will be any accountability for those accused of carrying out the alleged crimes and whether Russian President Vladimir Putin himself will be forced to bear any responsibility.  Still Harris vowed Saturday that the US would support the judicial process.  “In the face of these indisputable facts, to all of us here in Munich, let us renew our commitment to accountability. Let us renew our commitment to the rule of law,” she said. “As for the United States, we will continue to support the judicial process in Ukraine and international investigations because justice must be served. Let us all agree, on behalf of all the victims, known and unknown: Justice must be served.”‘For as long as it takes’Harris, in her speech Saturday, pledged that the US would “strongly support” Ukraine “for as long as it takes,” touting the Ukrainian people’s resolve and resilience.   “There will be more dark days in Ukraine. The daily agony of war will persist,” she said. “But if Putin thinks he can wait us out, he’s badly mistaken. Time is not on his side.”  A US Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) patrols the countryside of the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli in Syria's northeastern Hasakeh province, on April 20, 2022. (Photo by Delil souleiman / AFP) (Photo by DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP via Getty Images)Delil souleiman/AFP/Getty ImagesAmerican aid to Ukraine ramps up but House GOP drama causes worry over future military helpQuestions have swirled in recent months about how much more funding the US will provide to Ukraine’s war effort, now that Republicans are in charge of the US House of Repsentatives and have promised no “blank checks.” But Harris noted Saturday how many congressional leaders were at the conference in Munich. This included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.  “They are here together because they understand the stakes. The leadership of these members has been vital to America’s support of Ukraine, and President Biden and I know that their support for Ukraine will continue,” the vice president said.   Blinken said Saturday that the US government has a “profound stake” in a “just and durable” peace in Ukraine.  “Any peace has to be consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter. It is fundamentally against the interests of every other country around the world to wind up with a result that somehow indicates the seizure by force of territory, that validates that,” Blinken said during a discussion panel in Munich with Annalena Baerbock and Dmytro Kuleba, his respective German and Ukrainian counterparts.  “Because if we do that, we will open a Pandora’s box around the world, and every would-be aggressor will conclude that if Russia got away with it, we can get away with it. And that’s not in anyone’s interest because it’s a recipe for a world of conflict,” he added.   Also in Munich, CIA Director Bill Burns said Saturday that intelligence sharing with NATO allies has proved essential to supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion.  “It’s a two-way street. We’ve learned a lot from our NATO partners. We learn a lot from the Ukrainians as well,” Burns said in a separate panel discussion. That, he said, “has been the kind of essential cement in the coalition that the president has organized.”Warnings about ChinaMeanwhile, Harris expressed concern over China’s continued support of Russia since the war in Ukraine began.  “We have also seen nations like North Korea and Iran send weapons in support of Russia’s brutal war. We are also troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with Moscow since the war began,” Harris said.  “Looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing and further undermine a rules-based order,” she said.  The US recently began seeing “disturbing” trendlines in China’s support for Russia’s military, US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN, and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught.   Chinese national flags and the red flags are streamed in the wind on the rooftop at Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China on January 2, 2023.Ichiro Ohara/APBiden administration raised concerns with Beijing over Chinese companies' non-lethal aid in Russian war effortThe officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture, but they said it has concerned US officials enough to share the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich conference over the past several days.  Officials said the US is seeing China publicly trying to maintain relationships with Europe and present itself as a proponent of peace, while at the same time continuing to partner with the Russian military during large-scale exercises and boosting its trade and fuel purchases from Moscow.  China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, said Saturday in Munich that Beijing was ready to present its peace proposition for Ukraine, a rare remark that referred to the Ukraine conflict as a war.  “This warfare cannot continue to rage on,” he said. “We need to think about what efforts we can make to bring this warfare to an end.”  CNN has reported that Wang visit Russia this month, according to China’s Foreign Ministry, the first visit to the country from a Chinese official in that role since Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

What’s happening in entertainmentWhat would you title a movie about a wild bear that goes on a cocaine-fueled killing spree? Exactly … “Cocaine Bear,” which is “inspired by true events,” appears to be just what you’d expect from a film about an apex predator that finds a stash of drugs that literally (not figuratively) fell from the sky. Much carnage and campiness ensues. “Cocaine Bear” features the late Ray Liotta in his last role, as well as actors Keri Russell, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Christian Convery-Jennings, Alden Ehrenreich and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. It opens in theaters on Friday.  What’s happening in sportsIf you are a sports fan, today is a good day to get comfortable on the couch – just make sure there are fresh batteries in the remote.  First up is the final round of the Genesis Invitational golf tournament at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, hosted by Tiger Woods. Jon Rahm leads the pack at 15 under par, followed by Max Homa at 12 under par. Tiger Woods, who narrowly made the cut to play the weekend, begins the day in a tie for 26th place. This is the first official tournament start for the 47-year-old Woods since the Open Championship last July, where he failed to make the cut. Woods was severely injured in a car accident following the 2021 Genesis Invitational.  Later in the day is the 65th annual Daytona 500, the season-opener of the NASCAR Cup Series. The race gets underway at 2:30 p.m. ET.  And it’s the NBA’s All-Star weekend, culminating with Team LeBron facing Team Giannis in the 72nd All-Star Game at 8:30 p.m. ET from Salt Lake City.

Video Ad FeedbackReporter shares what Blinken and Chinese foreign minister discussed    01:57   - Source:CNNWashingtonCNN      Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made clear that the US has no doubt China was seeking to surveil the US via the balloon that was ultimately shot down off the coast of South Carolina earlier this month.   “I can’t say dispositively what the original intent was, but that doesn’t matter because what we saw when it was over the United States was clearly an attempt to surveil very sensitive military sites,” Blinken said on ABC’s “This Week” in an interview taped Saturday.  “The balloon went over many of them. It, in some cases, loitered,” he added. “We took measures to protect that information. We took measures to get information about the balloon. And I think we’ll know more when we … actually get the remains.”  Antony Blinken and Wang YiBlinken and Chinese counterpart meet in first face-to-face since spy balloon shot downFollowing the downing of the suspected Chinese spy balloon, the US military downed three subsequent objects that were much smaller and are now believed to have not been tied to any country’s surveillance program, President Joe Biden said last week. Instead, they were likely used for weather or research purposes by private entities.  US officials have said that the Chinese balloon, in contrast, had a payload – or the equipment it was carrying – the size of roughly three buses and was capable of collecting signals intelligence and taking photos. The balloon traveled over sensitive sites in Montana, officials have said, but the administration has said it tracked the balloon’s path and worked to minimize its intelligence collection capabilities.  The US has said that the balloon was part of a large fleet controlled by the Chinese military that has conducted surveillance over at least 40 countries across five continents in recent years.  “There’s absolutely no doubt in our minds about what the balloon, once over the United States, was attempting to do. And no doubt in our minds about this surveillance balloon program that China has, and again, has been used over more than 40 countries around the world,” Blinken told ABC.   On the topic of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the top US diplomat said Sunday he has concerns over China’s support of Russia’s military, specifically that Beijing is considering supplying Moscow with “lethal support.”  United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken (R) meets with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba (center at L) at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 18, 2023.

The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture but said US officials have been concerned enough that they shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference in Germany over the past several days.  “We’ve been watching this very closely,” Blinken told “Face the Nation” on CBS while in Munich.  “The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” Blinken said.

A rally against state Senate Bill 147,which would ban Chinese citizens from buying real estate in Texas, outside City Hall in Houston on January 23.Go Nakamura/The New York Times/ReduxA version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.CNN      New efforts to bar Chinese citizens and others from owning property in Texas and other states echo the treatment of Asian people in the US more than 100 years ago, when Congress barred them from obtaining citizenship and multiple state laws restricted land ownership.  In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin is expected to sign legislation to bar citizens of countries the State Department has designated as “foreign adversaries” from owning agricultural land. Companies with deep ties to those countries would also be affected. Those countries currently include China, Russia, North Korea and Iran. There are similar proposals in Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota. Foreign owners control a fraction of US farmland, according to the Congressional Research Service.In Texas, a much broader proposal names those countries and bans citizens of them from owning any land whatsoever. The ban would presumably extend to legal immigrants living in the US. That bill is still working its way through the legislature but has the support of Gov. Greg Abbott.The Texas proposal in particular specifically recalls a despicable chapter in US history, when so-called Alien Land Laws were passed in numerous states between the 1880s and 1920s to specifically bar Asian people from owning land. The California Alien Land Law was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in 1952 for violating the 14th Amendment.  In 1923, the Hollywood Association started a campaign to expel the Japanese from their community. Hollywood resident, Mrs. B. G. Miller, points to an anti-Japanese sign on her house.Bettmann Archive/Getty ImagesChinese people were explicitly barred from immigration to the US for generations – from the 1880s, when Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, until that law’s repeal during World War II.A ban on people ‘ineligible for citizenship’ owning propertySo few Chinese people were allowed to immigrate for another generation after that until 1965 – 105 per year – that it amounted to a de facto ban.  As a result, the anti-Asian property laws mostly affected Japanese Americans.  While the laws did not specifically single out Asians, they were applied to people “ineligible for citizenship.”   That made the laws specifically apply to Asians since Congress, at the time, allowed citizenship only for immigrants coming from Europe or Africa.  The most notorious example of Alien Land Laws was in California, which passed multiple versions of these laws over the years, and where Asian immigrants were concentrated.   One celebrated and yearslong court battle pitted a Japanese immigrant, Jukichi Harada, who found a way around the law by having his children own the house where his family lived in Riverside, California. They were ultimately able to keep the house when a judge ruled in their favor in 1918, but they were later moved to internment camps during World War II because of their Japanese ancestry.   Today, the Harada House is a National Historic Landmark and a museum. Reinvoking the ‘Yellow Peril’I called Madeline Hsu, a history professor and expert in Asian American studies at the University of Texas at Austin, to ask if these new proposals are an example of history repeating itself.  “It’s definitely sort of reinvocation of kind of what people in Asian American studies would refer to as ‘Yellow Peril’ fearmongering,” she said.  “There are ways in which it resonates with what happened to Japanese Americans during World War II, where regardless of citizenship, regardless of nativity, they were racially categorized as enemy aliens.”Alien Land Laws in TexasHsu pointed me to an article in the Journal of Southern History by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley professor Brent Campney that documents fears of a Japanese “invasion” in the Rio Grande Valley more than 100 years ago.‘Exacerbating tensions’Campney’s larger argument in studying the treatment of Asian Americans, in this case people of Japanese descent, is that the local discrimination in Texas and also California reverberated back into the growing animosity between Japan and the US leading up to World War II.  Decades before the US government robbed Japanese Americans of their rights and held them in camps, Campney writes, “white Americans appealed to the same stereotypes and exclusionary impulses used against the Japanese during the internment, exacerbating tensions between Japan and the United States.”  That’s a historical lesson everyone has an interest in learning as tensions between the US and China grow today. The US military is maneuvering with allies to control China in the Pacific. The US government is focused on making the economy more independent from Chinese manufacturing. There is even talk of banning TikTok, the app popular with young people in the US and owned by a private Chinese company.The problem of targeting people by nationalityThese efforts against a government seep into more problematic territory when they seem to target the many Chinese and ethnic Chinese people who live in the US.  “Targeting people by nationality is also problematic,” Hsu said. “That’s not a good way of identifying people who are national security risks or who are acting on behalf of a foreign government.”  She drew a correlation between these new state proposals and former President Donald Trump’s promise to enforce a ban on Muslims traveling to the US. In order to get a plan through the Supreme Court, he instead banned, for a time, travel from certain countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America.   The Texas bill similarly targets specific countries by name and generalizes that all citizens of those countries could be a threat.   “The only thing it does is it expresses these kinds of gut suspicions and hostility to these countries,” Hsu said.

Soaring energy costs could push 141 million into extreme poverty, report says    			By Tara Subramaniam, CNN		  Updated  9:55 AM EST, Fri February 17, 2023    Link Copied!   A gas station in Gdansk, Poland on February 5, 2023. European countries reliant on oil and natural gas imports from Russia are facing unprecedented fuel supply shortages and rising prices.Michal Fludra/NurPhoto/Getty Images/FILECNN      The energy crisis triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine could push 141 million people worldwide into extreme poverty, according to a new report published Thursday in the journal Nature Energy.  Researchers from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China and the United States modeled the impacts of increased energy prices in 116 countries and found household spending increased up to 4.8% on average, as coal and natural gas prices surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding to post-pandemic increases.   In low-income countries, the report said poorer households already facing severe food shortages were at greater risk of poverty due to higher energy costs. Households in higher income countries also felt the impact of rising energy prices but were more likely to be able to absorb them into household budgets, the report said.  And some countries are more exposed than others – for example, increases in energy costs in Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic are above the global average, mainly because those countries rely more on energy-intensive industries. Poland in particular relied on coal for 68.5% of its energy generation, as of 2020.  Energy price hikes caused by the crisis in Ukraine have also resulted in the increased cost of necessities like food. Compared to a year ago, in the US the prices of eggs went up 70.1%, margarine 44.7%, butter 26.3%, flour 20.4%, bread 14.9%, sugar 13.5%, milk 11%, chicken 10.5% and, together, fruit and vegetable prices increased 7.2%, according to inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this month.  And consumer goods companies say prices are unlikely to fall any time soon.  On Thursday, the CEO of Nestlé, the world’s largest food group, echoed other consumer giants like Unilever and Proctor & Gamble to warn that the price of staple items will rise further this year.   “Like all the consumers around the world, we’ve been hit by inflation and now we’re trying to repair the damage that has been done,” Nestlé CEO Mark Schneider said on a call with reporters Thursday, though he declined to say which of the company’s 2,000 brands, which span frozen food, confectionery and baby formula, would be affected by price increases.  On a call last week, Unilever’s chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly told journalists, “We’re probably past peak inflation, but we’re not yet at peak prices.” Unilever’s CEO said on the same call that the company expects food prices to increase significantly in 2023.

Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters'Inconsistent with human survival': UN chief slams fossil fuel industry expansion in Davos speechAccording to the report, many governments worldwide have already taken steps to lessen the impact of soaring energy prices on households, from reducing energy taxes and providing energy bill discounts to one-off energy subsidies and price caps.   But the report suggests more could be done, such as setting price subsidies, imposing windfall taxes on energy companies, and passing legislation to use more sustainable sources of energy along food supply chains.  The report adds that this energy crisis should serve as a reminder of the risks of “an energy system highly reliant on fossil fuels.” Not only does it leave millions on the brink of extreme poverty, but it also accelerates climate change, which poses more challenges to those most vulnerable to rising energy prices.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin appear after a session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.Maxim Shemetov/ReutersEditor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.CNN      It was an image that could have portended the start of a new era.   Sporting a self-satisfied grin, Russian President Vladimir Putin stood alongside a confident Chinese President Xi Jinping in February of last year. Putin was still denying plans to invade Ukraine, which he would do just after the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics.   In a show of unity, the leaders of the two nuclear powers vowed to have a relationship with “no limits.” It looked like a pivotal moment in a global realignment of power.  A year later, Putin’s push for a quick victory in Ukraine, one that would solidify Russia’s place as a top global player, looks like a disaster, and the alliance appears much less valuable to Xi.   Frida GhitisAnd yet, China and Russia remain close, the world’s two leading autocracies determined to challenge the West and undercut the notion that genuine democracy is the most desirable system of government – lest it come for their jobs.   Both leaders have been courting autocratic regimes. Russia is seeking armaments for its floundering war in Ukraine, and China is hard at work trying to become the center of a new alliance to counter the West. The project has faltered; it is far from a resounding success. But it is very much a work in progress.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added momentum to the forces trying to reshape the world and thrown a light on the path forward for US foreign policy.   In addition to fortifying NATO and strengthening alliances, which President Joe Biden’s administration has accomplished with great success, the US must aim to forestall the creation of a credible, unified force of aggressive antidemocratic regimes.   That means making sure that Russia doesn’t win in Ukraine, but also prying apart Moscow and Beijing (echoing then-President Richard Nixon in the 1970s) and countering China’s efforts to forge stronger bonds with Iran.  A bloc of aggressively anti-Western autocracies is precisely what Xi and Putin were launching that day in February. Beijing and Moscow sought to replace the rule of law with “the rule of the strongest,” warned European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  But the rule of the strongest doesn’t work when you can’t win, which is how Russia’s plans started to unravel, and China had to rethink its commitment.

(Photo by Leon Klein/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Anadolu Agency/GettyRussian forces 'clearly have very poor standards,' Gen. Petraeus saysXi’s “no-limits” friendship did not pan out quite as Putin might have expected. Publicly, China still refuses to call the Russian military campaign an invasion – and Beijing has never condemned Russia’s unprovoked attack of its neighbor. But China has not armed Russian forces, and has at times issued veiled warnings against Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons.   But even after expressing “questions and concerns” about the war, Xi has reaffirmed the strategic bonds. After a video meeting in December, Putin gushed, “We share the same views on the…transformation of the global geopolitical landscape.” Xi, according to state media, said the two countries should “strengthen strategic coordination.”    Is Xi in or out with Putin? Xi seems to want it both ways. He wants the relationship with a country that has invaded its neighbor without provocation, but he’s trying to present himself as a responsible global leader; an alternative to the democratic Western model for other countries to follow.  Xi’s desire to emerge as the de facto leader of a major strategic bloc, but one with the prestige of a statesman, creates an opportunity for the West to manage the relationship in a way that achieves President Biden’s efforts to compete vigorously while avoiding a war with China. It is an objective he reiterated on Thursday while talking about the Chinese balloon that traversed the US earlier this month.  If Putin’s conflict with Ukraine had turned into a swift Russian victory, the alliance of autocracies would have made huge strides. Moscow’s stumbling has slowed its progress. As Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman noted, Russia could become an albatross around Beijing’s neck.  Without Chinese military backing, Putin has looked to other regimes for assistance.

(AP Photo/Olivier Matthys)Olivier Matthys/APOpinion: How the war in Ukraine obscured an uncomfortable truthAccording to US intelligence, Russia has bought artillery shells from North Korea, another notorious dictatorship, which denies its involvement in a war whose morality is beyond the pale.  But it is Iran that has apparently provided more significant support.  Iranian drones have been one of the weapons of choice as Russia kills Ukrainian civilians and destroys Ukraine’s infrastructure. Tehran first denied it was arming Russia, saying it “has not and will not” provide weapons to Russia.   Those adamant denials changed later, with Iran claiming it sold weapons before the war started, but those were not being used in Ukraine. Now, newly-declassified documents show the drones in Ukraine are identical to those Iran has used in the Middle East.  Iran, whose repressive, interventionist regime has also turned it, like Russia, into a pariah to much of the world, now finds itself being courted by both Moscow and Beijing.   This week, Ebrahim Raisi became the first Iranian president to visit China in 20 years. The trip, at Xi’s invitation, ostensibly aims to implement an agreement for a 25-year strategic cooperation pact the two reached at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2021.  The Beijing-Tehran ties have raised alarms among both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who fear China’s support could help Tehran evade sanctions related to its nuclear and conventional weapons programs, support for terrorism and human rights abuses.  Sitting with Raisi, Xi declared that China will strengthen cooperation with Iran, “no matter how international and regional situations change.” Still, recall the “no limits” pledge to Russia. Xi’s vows can prove more conditional than they sound.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Beijing’s relationship with Tehran is complicated. In December, when Xi visited Iran-foe Saudi Arabia, a joint statement after meeting with Saudi officials noted Iran’s “destabilizing regional activities” and “support for terrorist and sectarian groups,” infuriating Iran.  Clearly, there’s an internal contradiction in Xi’s dual goals. If you want to elevate your standing to that of a respected global leader, it’s hard to create an alliance of rule-breaking autocrats and assorted dictators, and then expect other countries to join enthusiastically.   Much has changed since that day in Beijing, when Xi and Putin smiled for the cameras, expecting a new era to begin. The war didn’t turn out as expected, but it did make it clear that democracies need to push back against belligerent antidemocratic regimes and keep them from joining forces.

Video Ad FeedbackInside a Chinese factory that made high-tech balloons in 2015    03:45   - Source:CNNCNN      The US military has concluded its recovery operations for the suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina earlier this month, as well as the search for flying objects it later downed off the coast of Alaska and over Lake Huron after days of ultimately fruitless searches.  The recovery effort ended after “U.S. Navy assets assigned to U.S. Northern Command successfully located and retrieved debris” from the balloon, a statement from US Northern Command said Friday.  “Final pieces of debris are being transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory in Virginia for counterintelligence exploitation, as has occurred with the previous surface and subsurface debris recovered. U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels have departed the area. Air and maritime safety perimeters have been lifted,” the statement added.  NORTHCOM said in a statement later in the day that it would end the search for two of the three objects shot down over North America last weekend, stating that”the US military, federal agencies, and Canadian partners conducted systematic searches of each area using a variety of capabilities, including airborne imagery and sensors, surface sensors and inspections, and subsurface scans, and did not locate the debris.”  U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about a high-altitude Chinese balloon and three other objects that were recently shot down by U.S. fighter jets, during brief remarks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building's South Court Auditorium on the White House campus in Washington, DC, on February 16, 2023.Kevin Lamarque/ReutersBiden says objects shot down over North America last week appear to not be part of China's spy balloon operationDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved the command’s recommendation to call off the search.  The Biden administration had repeatedly pointed to the need to locate and recover the downed objects to be able to identify what they were and who launched them, but US officials had grown less optimistic about recovering debris from them.  The failed search efforts make it increasingly unlikely the public will receive a thorough explanation of what the objects were that US fighters had shot down over three consecutive days.  National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby suggested as much at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters, “We would like nothing better, but I can’t sit here and promise you that we’ll get to that level of fidelity of detail.”  He noted the “extremely bad winter weather” up in the North of Alaska and “arctic conditions” were making recovery efforts extremely difficult.   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Kirby said, have been unable to find the object downed in the Yukon territory and the Canadians have decided not to look for the object that fell into Lake Huron.  “So pretty tough conditions, going to be very difficult to find them, let alone once you find that debris be able to do the forensics to identify it. So I can’t promise you that we’ll know definitively one way or the other,” he added.   The RCMP had said in a statement Friday that “the highest probability area has been searched and the debris was not located.”  After the Chinese balloon was shot down, the US military had downed the three subsequent objects that were much smaller and are now believed to have not been tied to any country’s surveillance program, President Joe Biden said Thursday. Instead, they were likely used for weather or research purposes by private entities.  US officials have said that the Chinese balloon, in contrast, had a payload – or the equipment it was carrying – the size of roughly three buses and was capable of collecting signals intelligence and taking photos. The balloon traveled over sensitive sites in Montana, officials have said, but the administration has said it tracked the balloon’s path and worked to minimize its intelligence collection capabilities.  The US has said that the balloon is part of a large fleet controlled by the Chinese military that has conducted surveillance over at least 40 countries across five continents in recent years.  CNN reported this week that the US intelligence community is examining the possibility that the balloon, which lifted off from Hainan, China, in January, did not intend to travel over the continental US but was blown off its path by strong winds. The balloon’s original surveillance target was likely Guam, but the weather may have shifted the balloon northward, officials said.  The president said that he expects to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the balloon but that he will not apologize for shooting it down.  “I hope we are going to get to the bottom of this, but I make no apologies for taking down that balloon,” he said.  The US will be crafting parameters moving forward on how to handle unidentified objects in US airspace that could pose a risk to civilian aircraft, Biden said.

The first Iranian president to arrive in China on a state visit in two decades, Raisi was keen to tell Beijing that it has not given enough support to Tehran, especially economically.   “Unfortunately, I must say that we have seriously fallen behind in these relations,” he said, referring to trade and economic ties. Part of his mission, he said, was to implement the China-Iran Strategic Partnership Plan (CISPP), a pact that would see Beijing invest up to $400 billion in Iran’s economy over a 25-year period in exchange for a steady supply of Iranian oil.   Raisi said that economic ties had regressed, and that the two nations needed to compensate for that.    The public criticism on the eve of the landmark trip demonstrated the heavily-sanctioned Islamic Republic’s disappointment with an ally that has in many ways become one of its few economic lifelines.   The speech was likely “a reflection of Tehran’s frustration with China’s hesitancies about deepening its economic ties with Iran,” Henry Rome, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told CNN. “The same issues that have constrained China-Iran relations for years appear to remain.”    Analysts said Raisi’s speech was a clear call for China to live up to its end of the relationship, seeking economic guarantees from the Asian power so he can have something to show at home amid a wave of anti-government protests and increasing global isolation.   “The mileage Raisi will get for having a visit is going to be very limited if that visit doesn’t produce anything,” said Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC. “The Iranians are not in a position right now in which a visit in and of itself is sufficiently good for them…They need more.”   Whether Iran is satisfied with what China offered it, however, is yet to be seen.   “Though more substance may be achieved following the visit, the reality is that Raisi needs both the substance and the announcement of concrete agreements,” said Parsi. He added that China, on the other hand, appears to be inclined to “play matters down” as it balances the partnership with its ties with Gulf Arab states at odds with Iran, as well as its own fraught relations with the US.In a joint statement, both China and Iran said they are “willing to work together to implement” the CISPP and “continue to deepen cooperation in trade, agriculture, industry, renewable energy, infrastructure and other fields.”   On Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who accompanied Raisi to China, said that the two countries agreed to remove obstacles in the way of implementing the CISPP, adding that Iran was “optimistic at the results of the negotiations,” according to state news agency IRNA.   Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi attends the 22nd meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization leaders' summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan on Friday.Shanghai Cooperation Organization/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesIran inches one step closer to Russia and China as nuclear talks falter Chinese President Xi Jinping also accepted an invitation to visit Iran on a future date.   Raisi’s trip comes as Beijing strengthens its ties with Iran’s foe Saudi Arabia, and as cheap Russian oil potentially threatens Iran’s crude exports to China.    Less than two years after he took power, Raisi’s term has witnessed growing isolation from the West – especially after Iran supplied Russia with drones to use in its war on Ukraine – and failed efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that removed some barriers to international trade with the Islamic Republic.   As Western sanctions cripple its economy, Beijing has helped keep Tehran afloat economically. China is Iran’s biggest oil customer, buying sanctioned but cheap barrels that other nations would not touch.   Tehran’s other ally, Russia, has however been biting into its Asian oil market as China buys more Russian barrels – also sanctioned by the West – for cheap, threatening one of Iran’s last economic lifelines.   The visit is therefore a strategic one, analysts say, and an attempt by Iran pull itself back up from domestic instability and worsened isolation from the West.    “(It) is an opportunity for Raisi to try to draw a line under the past five months of domestic unrest and project a sense of normalcy at home and abroad,” said Rome.   'They still want a regime change.' Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh says the anger behind Iran's protests remainsBut Jacopo Scita, a policy fellow at the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation in London, said he did not expect the visit to result in much more than a recognition of China’s partnership with Iran.    “Raisi will hardly get much from the economic perspective, except for a new series of memoranda of understanding and some minor deals,” he told CNN.   Iran has also been reminding its people that looking eastward is the right path toward economic revival as prospects of returning to nuclear agreement fade, said Parsi. The government has been keen to show that it has “an eastern option” that is supportive and lucrative, he said.    Scita said that China is unlikely to live up to Iran’s expectations, however.   “I don’t believe that Beijing can offer guarantees to Tehran except a pledge to continue importing a minimum amount of crude regardless of the global market situation and China’s domestic demand,” he told CNN.   How Raisi’s visit will be received back at home remains unclear. If the trip yields no concrete results in the coming days, then Iran’s move eastward could prove to be “a huge strategic mistake that the Raisi government has really rushed into,” said Parsi.   Additional reporting by Adam Pourahmadi and Simone McCarthy  Turkey-Syria quake Turkey’s earthquake left 84,000 buildings either destroyed or in need of demolition after sustaining heavy damage, Turkish Urban Affairs and Environment Minister Murat Kurum said Friday, according to state media.   The deadly earthquake – which sent shockwaves across the region – has so far killed more than 43,000 across both Turkey and Syria.    At least 38,000 people died in Turkey, according to Turkey’s governmental disaster management agency, AFAD. The death toll in Syria remains at least 5,841, according to the latest numbers reported Tuesday by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).   Here’s the latest:   Since the February 6 earthquake, a total of 143 trucks loaded with aid provided by six UN agencies have crossed from Turkey to northwest Syria through two border crossings, a OCHA statement said Friday. Two men were rescued in Hatay ten days after the earthquake struck, said Turkey’s Health Minister Fahrettin Friday. And late on Thursday, a 12-year-old boy was rescued from rubble in southern Hatay 260 hours after the earthquake hit, according to CNN Turk, which reported live from the scene. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said upon returning from Syria on Tuesday that more than a decade of war in the region has left towns destroyed, with the health system unable to cope with this scale of emergency. “Survivors are now facing freezing conditions without adequate shelter, heating, food, clean water or medical care,” he said. Turkey added Elazig as the 11th province in the list of those impacted by the quake, the ruling party spokesman said. A Turkish family was reunited with the ‘miracle baby’ that was found in the rubble of the quake after they had given up hope. A confused woman asked her rescuers “What day is it?” when pulled alive from the rubble of last week’s earthquake after 228 hours. After attending the Munich Security Conference in Germany, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel on to Turkey and Greece on Sunday to see US efforts to assist with the earthquake and to meet with Turkish and Greek officials, the State Department said Wednesday. The digest Palestinian activist beaten by Israeli soldier says he is scared for his life Palestinian activist Issa Amro, who was filmed being assaulted by an Israeli soldier on Monday, told CNN Thursday that he is physically and psychologically affected by the attack and fears for his life.    Background: Lawrence Wright, a writer for the New Yorker magazine, posted video of the assault on Twitter. It showed two IDF soldiers manhandling well-known activist Amro, throwing him onto the ground, and one soldier kicking him, before that soldier is pushed away by other troops. The Israeli soldier who was filmed assaulting Amro in Hebron was sentenced to 10 days in military jail. In response to CNN’s interview with Amro, Israel Defense Forces international spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said there was “no justification” for the soldier’s behavior, but suggested Amro had provoked the incident.  Why it matters: Amro said he is afraid for his life and for the lives of the people in the area, but added that, “unfortunately what happened to me is happening almost every day.” He said he filed many complaints to the Israeli police about soldier and settler violence, but had gotten no accountability. Amro also said he wants the Biden administration to reopen the Palestinian consulate in East Jerusalem. Protesters set fire to ATMs as Lebanese lira hits 80,000 against the dollar in new record low  Lebanon’s national currency has hit a new record low of 80,000 Lebanese lira against the US dollar, according to values sold on the black market on Thursday. On Thursday, protesters blocked roads across Beirut and set fires to ATMs and bank branches, according to videos posted on social media by the organizers, United for Lebanon and the Depositors Outcry Association, who are both advocating for the release of depositor savings.   Background: The lira has been on an exponential fall since January 20 when the Lebanese central bank (BDL) adjusted the official exchange rate for the first time in decades, from LL1,500 to LL15,000. Lebanese banks have been closed since Tuesday due to a strike announced by the Association of Banks in Lebanon. Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a statement Thursday that “efforts are continuing to address the financial situation.” Why it matters: Lebanon has been in a deepening financial crisis since 2019. The country moved toward securing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout in April 2022, but the deal is yet to be finalized.  Iran denies links to new al-Qaeda leader, calls US claim ‘Iranophobia’ Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian on Thursday denied claims by the US that al-Qaeda’s new leader, Seif al-Adel, is living in his country. “I advise White House to stop the failed Iranophobia game,” wrote Abdollahian on Twitter. “Linking Al-Qaeda to Iran is patently absurd and baseless,” he said.    Background: US State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday told reporters that the US backs a UN report linking al-Adel to Iran. “Our assessment aligns with that of the UN, the assessment that you (a reporter) referenced that Saif al-Adel is based in Iran,” said Price during a press briefing, adding that “offering safe haven to al-Qaeda is just another example of Iran’s wide-ranging support for terrorism, its destabilizing activities in the Middle East and beyond.” Why it matters: Tensions between Iran and the US have only worsened in recent months, as the Islamic Republic supplies drones to Russia for use in its war on Ukraine and negotiations to revive a 2015 deal remain frozen. The US said it killed al-Qaeda’s former leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a drone strike on Kabul, Afghanistan last year.  Around the regionThe lead sarcophagus when it was discovered ©PUI/2023 PUIA Roman-era lead sarcophagus was uncovered on Tuesday at the site of a 2000-year-old Roman necropolis in the Gaza Strip. The necropolis is along the Northern Gaza coast and 500 meters (0.3 miles) from the sea.    The sarcophagus may have belonged to a prominent individual based on where it was found, the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities’ director of excavation and museums, Jehad Yasin, told CNN on Thursday.    Yasin said the ancient Roman cemetery was discovered in 2022 “as excavations were carried out at the site in cooperation with Premiere Urgence Internationale and funded by the British Council.”    Premiere Urgence Internationale, a French humanitarian organization, has collaborated on “Palestinian cultural heritage preservation” projects in Gaza under a program called INTIQAL.    The coffin was exhumed from the site to perform archaeological analysis for bone identification, which will take around two months, according to Yasin.    A team of experts in ancient funerary will unseal the coffin in the coming weeks.     While Gaza is a site of frequent aerial bombardment and a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by Israeli and Egyptian officials, the sarcophagus remains intact.    “The state of preservation of the sarcophagus is exceptional, as it remained sealed and closed,” read a press release from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.    French and Palestinian archaeologists have uncovered eighty-five individual and collective tombs in the 3,500-square-meter Roman acropolis since its discovery last year, while ten of them have been opened for excavation.    Beyond the rubble of the coastal enclave lay dozens of artifacts and burial sites from the Roman, Byzantine and Canaanite eras.    Last year a Palestinian farmer discovered the head of a 4,500-year-old statue of Canaanite goddess Anat while another Palestinian farmer discovered a Byzantine-era mosaic in his orchard.    In 2022 the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities released their first Arabic archaeological guide titled “Gaza, the Gateway to the Levant.” The guide charts 39 archaeological sites in Gaza, including churches, mosques and ancient houses that date back to 6,000 years.    The ministry expects more archaeological findings at the necropolis.    Further sarcophagi are likely to be uncovered in the following months, said Director Yasin.

(U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Tyler Thompson)Petty Officer 1st Class Tyler Thompson/US NavyUS intel assessing possibility that Chinese spy balloon's path over US was accidentalBiden emphasized that there hasn’t been evidence to suggest “a sudden increase in the number of objects in the sky.” And although the most recent three objects appear to have been benign, Biden warned, “If any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people, I will take it down.”  The president said he has directed his team to devise “sharper rules for how we will deal with these unidentified objects moving forward, distinguishing between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not.” Those classified parameters will be shared with Congress when they are finished.   The president also said he’s directing national security adviser Jake Sullivan to lead a “government-wide effort” for how to address future encounters with similar high-altitude objects.   Specifically, the administration will be establishing an improved inventory of unmanned airborne objects above American airspace, implementing further measures to detect the objects, update rules and regulations for encounters with these types of objects above US skies, and establishing common global norms for similar encounters.   The president said he expects to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the matter, along with keeping allies and Congress informed.   “And I hope we are going to get to the bottom of this, but I make no apologies for taking down that balloon,” he added.    China on Friday said the US was “in no position to talk about establishing global norms” after Biden’s pledge to develop new rules for unidentified objects.   “The international practice already has relevant international laws and norms on civil aircraft,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a daily press briefing. “The US side overreacted and shot down the Chinese civilian uncrewed airship with excessive force, disregarding international laws and practices.”  Wang also repeated Beijing’s accusation that the US had flown balloons into Chinese airspace in the past – a claim that the White House has denied – and said he had “no information to provide” on potential Biden-Xi talks.   Federal officials have said an initial Chinese surveillance balloon downed off the coast of South Carolina earlier this month was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations and had a payload around the size of three buses. By comparison, the subsequent objects, which haven’t been attributed to a specific country or entity, are believed to be much smaller.   It’s anticipated that new protocols on how the US will handle similar unidentified objects going forward will be released this week.  Earlier this week, Canadian officials were candid about the difficult task of recovering debris from high-altitude objects shot down over Canada and the US, admitting it could still take days or weeks and there is no guarantee the debris will be found.  And on Thursday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced the search for debris from high-altitude objects shot down over Canada and the US was suspended in the Lake Huron area. The search will continue in Yukon, the update said.  Administration officials from the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence community have briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill on the initial Chinese spy balloon in recent days.   Republicans on Capitol Hill have criticized Biden for not approving the military to down the first balloon quickly enough, letting it sail eastward for days. They had also called on him to speak on the matter.   But administration officials argued that the US didn’t move earlier to shoot down the balloon in part over fears it could provoke an escalation of military tensions with China. They also told lawmakers the balloon was not first shot down when it entered Alaskan airspace because the waters there are cold and deep, making it less likely they could have recovered the balloon.

Here's what high-altitude balloons are used forAnd officials had been wary of having the president speak publicly about the objects until more information was gathered about the three unidentified objects that were downed last weekend.   “He believed it was important to explain what we had learned,” a senior administration official said, adding the president wanted to “put into context” the new rules and the administration’s plans going forward for dealing with the unidentified objects.  Biden on Thursday justified the decision to wait to shoot the Chinese balloon, saying he gave the green light for the US military to take it down “as soon as it was safe to do so.”   “The military advised against shooting it down over land because of the sheer size of it. It was the size of multiple school buses and it posed a risk to people on the ground if it was shot down where people lived,” he said. “Instead, we tracked it closely, we analyzed its capabilities and we learned more about how it operates. Because we knew its path, we were able to protect sensitive sites against collection. We waited until it was safely over water, which would not only protect civilians, but also enable us to recover substantial components for further analytics.”   Shooting down the balloon, Biden added, sent “a clear message that the violation of our sovereignty was unacceptable. We’ll act to protect our country and we did.”   This story and its headline have been updated with additional developments.

Benchmark wholesale gas prices fell almost 5% Friday to hit €49 ($52) per megawatt hour, their lowest level since September 2021 and a fraction of the all-time high of €320 hit in August last year, according to data  from Independent Commodity Intelligence Service.   It’s a remarkable turnaround for a continent that, just a few months ago, faced shortages and potential blackouts as Russia — once its biggest supplier — drastically lowered gas exports to Europe in retaliation for EU sanctions over its war in Ukraine.   The plunge in prices will further reduce the risk of a recession in Europe.   A photo shows the adjustment wheel of a gas boiler in a flat in Dortmund, western Germany, on October 4, 2022.

Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty ImagesNatural gas prices haven't been this low since Russia went to warPrices have been pushed lower by unseasonably warm weather this winter, as well as the region’s barnstorming efforts to conserve gas, find alternative suppliers and fill its storage facilities.   Gas stores across the European Union were 65% full on Thursday, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe, an industry body. That’s well above the 45% the EU averaged at this point in the five years to 2022.  The bloc has also boosted imports of pipeline natural gas from Norway, and of liquefied natural gas (LNG) — a chilled, liquid form of gas that can be transported via sea tankers — mostly from the United States and Qatar.  “Europe looks like it has successfully weaned itself off Russian gas,” Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN.   “It’s still relatively expensive, compared with the pre-crisis long-term average, but current price levels do not reflect a risk of shortages anymore, as they did much of last year.”  Salomon Fiedler, an economist at Berenberg bank, said in a note on Friday that he expected Europe to avoid an energy crisis next winter, if — under average temperatures — it maintains its current import levels from non-Russian suppliers; gas consumption remains 20% below average levels; and domestic gas production stays the same.  “If worst came to worst, a combination of no Russian supplies, colder weather and significantly reduced [gas] savings — of only 10% — would expose the EU to a risk of shortages next winter,” he said, though this is an “unlikely combination.”Competing with ChinaBut demand for gas in China could come roaring back this year, tightening the global LNG market and exerting upward pressure on prices.   The world’s second-largest economy ditched its strict zero-Covid policy in December after more than three years, upping estimates for global economic growth as well as expectations for energy consumption as its citizens start spending and traveling again.   “Europe is in a much better position than feared only a few months ago,” Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie, told CNN. “But it is only from 2025, when substantial LNG supply will start hitting the market, that European prices could go back to some sort of normality.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackMore from CNN Business    Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Camp toy store pleads for help after Silicon Valley Bank collapse    Mar 11, 2023  Jeff Chiu/AP    Stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg after revealing $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank exposure    Mar 11, 2023  Ad FeedbackCNN Business Videos    •VideoSNL’s take on the Oscars Preshow    Mar 12, 2023  •Video  CNN/Getty Images    Ex-Trump official describes Fox News’ relationship with Trump White House    Mar 12, 2023  •VideoWhat could impact be of second-largest bank failure in US history?

Tourists visit a historic district in Beijing on January 31, 2023. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images/FileHong KongCNN      China has declared a “major and decisive victory” in its handling of the coronavirus outbreak that swept the country in recent months following an abrupt relaxation of its “zero-Covid” policy late last year.   The ruling Communist Party’s top decision-making body made the assessment during a closed-door meeting on Thursday presided over by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, in the latest signal the country is seeking to minimize the political fallout from zero-Covid.  The years-long policy had generated widespread discontent – including rare nationwide protests – before it was scrapped in December amid rising economic costs, in a decision that caught the public off-guard.   The swift rollback of stringent disease controls sparked a surge in cases that saw hospitals overwhelmed and people scrambling for basic medicines. But the outbreak appears to have subsided in intensity in recent weeks, with official figures showing visits to fever clinics returning to levels below those of the period before restrictions were lifted after dropping from a peak in late December.  In its Thursday meeting, the Politburo Standing Committee said the highly populous nation had “created a miracle in human history” as it had “successfully pulled through a pandemic,” according to a summary published by state-run news agency Xinhua.  The summary also said the group claimed that China had kept the lowest Covid-19 fatality rate in the world – a metric that China’s top leadership touted throughout the pandemic, as its lockdowns, enforced quarantines and border restrictions kept case numbers – and fatalities – low compared with some other major economies.   But experts say the assessment – the first from China’s top leaders since the surge of cases has appeared to recede – merely serves to underscore the deep questions that remain about the impact of the outbreak on the country. Unknown tollSince ending zero-Covid, China has officially recorded more than 80,000 fatalities – a figure that counts people who were tested for Covid-19 and died in hospital but excludes deaths that went untested or those who died at home during the surge of the virus. Those excluded could be a sizable group, experts say, as testing stalled and many patients were likely to have avoided hospitals.   “There are still many questions about the death toll in China due to Covid – it might be useful if they could release more information, particularly about the all-cause deaths compared to the pre-Covid years,” said virologist Jin Dongyan, a professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Biomedical Sciences, pointing to one method for assessing a more complete picture of fatalities in the country.  China has also been criticized by the World Health Organization for its limited data transparency during the outbreak, including its earlier and more narrow definition of a Covid-19 death, which Chinese health officials updated in January.  It’s also not clear how many people were infected overall since China relaxed the zero-Covid policy – raising further questions about how authorities calculated the undisclosed Covid fatality rate, which experts say is typically measured by dividing the number of deaths over the total number of cases.   Chinese health authorities stopped releasing figures for so-called asymptomatic cases nationwide late last year, as they dismantled the countries’ extensive Covid-19 mass testing apparatus and allowed people to test and recover at home.   In late January, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief epidemiologist Wu Zunyou said on his personal social media account that around 80% of people in China had already been infected.   Reported death figures have also declined, with China reporting just 912 hospital deaths for the week of February 3-9, according to the latest CDC reporting, which also says fatalities peaked on January 4 with a total of 4,273 deaths that day.  Providing a more complete picture of the outbreak – and the death toll – may not suit the government’s interests of reassuring the public about their handling of the virus, according to Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.   Huang pointed to several international reports, based on modeling, which has placed the actual death toll at upwards of 1 million over the past two months. “You can’t expect the government to admit to this (scale),” he said, “because people are going to ask the question – how could we have paid so much economic and social cost (from zero-Covid) to essentially come up with an outcome that is equal if not worse to the (toll in the) US.” Moving forwardInstead, Huang said, Chinese leaders were seizing the moment to take control of the narrative around the outbreak as the surge appears to have receded.   “People’s lives are returning to normal, and the viral wave comes to an end, so that kind of uncertainty (about the outbreak) is no longer there, and there is a need to reconcile the contradictory narrative, the credibility crisis that the abrupt policy U-turn created,” Huang said, referring to the shift in official tone as China swiftly adjusted from warning about the dangers of the virus and the need to contain it, to allowing it to spread.   “This is the perfect time to say that the outcome justified the decision,” Huang said.   But even as signs indicate that China’s population has widespread natural immunity, as in other countries, that does not mean the virus is gone or that China’s health care systems are prepared for potential future surges driven by potential new variants, experts say.  The Politburo Standing Committee referenced the need to continue to bolster health care in its meeting, according to the Xinhua summary, which said the body “urged all localities and departments to optimize related mechanisms and measures, strengthen the medical service system,” and called for planning for the next phase of vaccinations and enhancing medical supplies.  Jin at the University of Hong Kong agreed that China needed to continue to prepare, even as signs suggested the latest surge was largely over.   “Covid is still around and will be with us for much, much longer,” he said. “After this tsunami, still they have the new challenge of strengthening the health care system.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Video Ad FeedbackInside a Chinese factory that made high-tech balloons in 2015    03:45   - Source:CNNCNN      When a strange white sphere appeared in the skies above the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in January 2022, it swiftly became a talking point in this sleepy Indian Ocean archipelago of 430,000 people.   Hundreds of members of the public spotted the strange object, which looked a little like a full moon, and were eager to speculate on what it was, reported local media. But “high-altitude surveillance balloon” didn’t seem high on many people’s guess list.  Many suggested it was a weather balloon; others, including local news outlet the Andaman Sheekha, thought that made no sense, ruling out the possibility on the grounds of the object’s shape, height, and photographs showing what appeared to be “eight dark panels” hanging from it.  Some did suggest spying might be involved, but that too seemed a strange explanation.  Under the headline, “Unidentified Flying Object over Port Blair city triggers curiosity and rumor,” the Sheekha posed a question: “In this age of ultra advanced satellites, who will use a flying object to spy?” Question floatedThat question, experts say, has taken on a greater resonance this month, after the United States shot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that spent days over American territory, including apparently lingering over nuclear missile silos in Montana.  US intelligence officials say the balloon – which China insists was a civilian weather research vessel – was part of an extensive Chinese surveillance program run from the island province of Hainan that has flown balloons over at least five continents in recent years.   Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, pictured in 2022.Anupam/Adobe StockOther governments have also raised concerns. Soon after the balloon was spotted over the US, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said the incident “should not be tolerated by the civilized international community,” adding it had experienced Chinese balloons flying over its territory in September 2021 and again in February 2022.   Japan meanwhile said it “strongly presumed” that three “balloon-shaped flying objects” detected in its airspace between November 2019 and September 2021 were “unmanned reconnaissance” aircraft flown by China.  But India – which administers the Andaman and Nicobar Islands – has remained conspicuously silent, despite questions being raised by the Indian media.  “Mystery balloon hovered over Andaman and Nicobar Islands around tri-service military drill,” reported India Today; “Chinese spy balloons, UFOs trigger paranoia among countries. Should India be worried?” asked Live Mint. “Reports Suggest India Was Targeted by Chinese Balloon Too,” ran a headline in The Wire; “Did a Chinese ‘spy’ balloon snoop on India too?” asked Firstpost.  China, meanwhile, has strongly denied running a balloon surveillance program. It maintains the vessel downed by the US was a weather balloon thrown off course and has also rejected Tokyo’s claims. Beijing said it firmly opposed “the Japanese side’s smear campaign against China” and said Japan should “stop following the US” by engaging in “deliberate speculation.”  “China is a responsible country that strictly abides by international law and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. (We) hope that all parties will look at it objectively,” China’s Foreign Ministry said in response to a question from CNN about whether the country had ever used balloons to spy on India.   The high-altitude balloon spotted above the United States.AP Images    Why the silence?But to many onlookers, the silence from New Delhi on the matter has been as baffling as the balloon-like object was to the readers of the Andaman Sheekha.  “I think (the Indian) government is being silent about it for the simple fact that (it) was unable to do anything about it,” said Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at New Delhi-based think tank Center for Policy Research.  “If it were to say that a spy balloon was found over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which is seen as a great bastion of Indian sovereignty, it would show the government in a very poor light.”   India will come under the international spotlight this year as it hosts two high-level summits – the G20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization – and it is “desperately keen” for them to go well, Singh said.  Indian prime minister Narendra Modi arrives for the G20 summit in Nusa Dua, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on November 15, 2022. Akbar Nugroho Gumay/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesAnd with a general election on the horizon in 2024, its leader Narendra Modi will be eager to look tough in the eyes of voters who swept him into power on a ticket of nationalism and a promise of India’s future greatness.  Acknowledging that a UFO – which may or may not have been spying – had floated above an archipelago that hosts a significant Indian military presence would compromise that message.   “Raising this issue of the balloon,” simply wouldn’t be in New Delhi’s interest, Singh concluded. “As a nationalist government, it would completely destroy and demolish its image within the country.”  But Manoj Kewalramani, a fellow of China studies at the Takshashila Institution in India, said silence was simply more New Delhi’s style.  “Historically, India has never spoken about these issues,” he said. “If the US has briefed India on the Chinese spying program, India will very careful about what they reveal, so as to not tarnish that relationship.”   CNN reached out to the Indian government for comment on this article but did not receive a response.Uncontacted tribes and an unsinkable aircraft carrier The Andaman and Nicobar Islands may seem an unlikely target for international espionage.  The remote, sleepy archipelago at the junction of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea lies about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Aceh, Indonesia, and more than 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) from the Indian capital New Delhi. Only a few dozen of its more than 500 islands are even inhabited.   India's Andaman and Nicobar islandsAnupam/Adobe StockThere is little commerce to speak of beyond fishing villages, and while the sandy beaches and rich biodiversity have made some of the islands popular with tourists, others are so remote they are home to uncontacted tribes.   In 2018, an American missionary, John Allen Chau, is thought to have been killed by the Sentinelese tribe after he arrived on North Sentinel Island, hoping to convert them to Christianity. In 2006, members of the same tribe killed two fishermen poachers whose boat drifted ashore. Two years earlier, one of its members was photographed firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare following the Asian tsunami. Protection groups have urged the public to respect their wish to remain uncontacted.  But as obscure and remote as these islands may be, there are reasons they might be of interest to foreign intelligence agencies.  In this undated photo released by the Anthropological Survey of India, Sentinelese tribe men row their canoe in India's Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. Anthropological Survey of India/APAs a major outpost in the Indian Ocean, the islands join the Bay of Bengal with the wider Indo-Pacific, via the Malacca Strait – one of the busiest and most important trade routes in the world.  The location also makes the islands a strategic military asset for India, and they are home to the only integrated tri-service (army, navy, air force) base of the Indian armed forces.  In recent years, New Delhi has poured great effort into enhancing the islands’ prospects as a military base, with Modi in 2019 unveiling a decade-long plan to add more troops, warships and aircraft to its existing fleet.   “The islands are used for military deployment and dominate the area,” said Singh, from the Center for Policy Research. “Various Indian military leaders have described the islands as an ‘unsinkable carrier.’”   In the event of a military clash between China and the US over Taiwan, Singh said, “the US could ask India for support from the islands.”  John Allen Chau/InstagramAmerican missionary believed killed by isolated tribe knew the risks, friends say“India has also been very protective about the islands. Very rarely have they allowed foreign military to exercise on land on these islands,” he added.  Kewalramani, from the Takshashila Institution, said China “would want to know what’s happening on the (Andaman and Nicobar) islands.”   However, he also said it remained unclear “whether they would do that through a balloon and whether a balloon could gather enough intel.” The bigger issueTo many commentators, the whole saga is less about what may or may not have been a surveillance balloon, and more about the Modi government’s reticence to engage on issues involving China for fear of sparking a diplomatic crisis ahead of next year’s Indian election.  While there may be some sensitive military secrets to be gleaned from Andaman and Nicobar islands, analysts suggest the real reason for tight lips in New Delhi may be connected to what is happening thousands of miles to the north, along India’s 2,100-mile (3,380-kilometer) disputed border with China.   It’s here in the thin air and freezing temperatures of the Himalayas that troops from the two nuclear-armed neighbors have clashed over the past few years, in what are startling reminders of India and China’s combustible relationship.  Tensions along the de factor border have been simmering for more than 60 years and have spilled over into war before. In 1962 a month-long conflict ended in a Chinese victory and India losing thousands of square miles of territory.  But rarely in recent years have those tensions been as high as they are now. Since a clash involving hand-to-hand fighting in 2020 claimed the lives of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers, both sides have deployed thousands of troops to the area, where they remain in what appears to be a semi-permanent stand-off.

China did something that they had not done before … they came into occupied areas … and refused to withdraw,” said former Lt. Gen. Rakesh Sharma, whose more than 40 years in the Indian army included a stint commanding the Fire and Fury Corps in the Ladakh area of the border.   There are now signs things may be heating up once again, according to Arzan Tarapore, South Asia research scholar at Stanford University’s Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center.  A brawl between troops from the two sides in December – what the Indian government characterized as a “physical scuffle” – was “part of the steady drumbeat of China building its military presence, asserting its control over disputed areas, and probing Indian defenses,” Tarapore said.   “It was just one episode in a string of episodes, and India should certainly expect more – and probably bigger – such probes and incursions in the future,” he added.Keeping silent, with a big stickWith the border issue heating up, analysts say Modi faces a difficult diplomatic balancing act.   On one hand, he needs to project a strong image to voters and show he is willing to stand his ground against China’s pressure at the border.  On the other, he must be careful to avoid inflaming the already tense relationship with Beijing by wading into China’s dispute with Washington over the balloon shot down off the US East Coast.  One reading of India’s silence may be that is adopting Theodore Roosevelt’s famous foreign policy maxim of, “Speak softly, and carry a big stick.”   New Delhi recently announced a 13% hike in its annual defense budget to 5.94 trillion rupees ($72.6 billion) – which is expected to fund, among other things, new access roads and fighter jets to be based along the disputed border.

Indian Army/AP/FileBut, as with the UFO in the Andaman and Nicobars, experts say New Delhi sometimes gives the impression that the less said about the border the better.  Kenneth Juster, a former US ambassador to India, told Indian television channel Times Now that New Delhi preferred Washington not to comment on Chinese aggression at the Himalayan border.  “The restraint in mentioning China in any US-India communication or any Quad communication comes from India, which is very concerned about not poking China in the eye,” he said, referring to discussions of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – a strategic US-led group that includes India, Japan and Australia and that Beijing is convinced is aimed at containing China’s rise.   Modi has largely avoided speaking publicly on the border issue, going as far as saying on live television shortly after the deadly 2020 clashes that, “No one has intruded and nor is anyone intruding.”   “He wants the crisis to go away. His reaction is to avoid talking about it,” said Singh, the analyst. “Propaganda and PR have led many Indians to believe that things (at the disputed border) are OK.”  Kewalramani, the China expert, said India simply preferred a lower-key approach in pushing back against Beijing, noting it had cracked down on Chinese businesses, including by banning some Chinese apps.    “While there aren’t huge gestures, it is part of India’s diplomatic culture to avoid aggression,” he said.   The problem with that approach, others warned, was that it risked making India appear weak.  “Considering that a crisis on the border is still ongoing, and continues to haunt India and China, the silence does not bode well for India,” Singh said.   “It emboldens China.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  USCrime + Justice    Energy + Environment    Extreme Weather    Space + ScienceWorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomPoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessTech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosMarketsPre-markets    After-Hours    Market Movers    Fear & Greed    World Markets    Investing    Markets Now    Before the Bell    NightcapOpinionPolitical Op-Eds    Social CommentaryHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsPro Football    College Football    Basketball    Baseball    Soccer    Olympics    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRAudio  CNN UnderscoredElectronics    Fashion    Beauty    Health & Fitness    Home    Reviews    Deals    Money    Gifts    Travel    Outdoors    Pets    CNN StoreCoupons  WeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Top Chinese investment banker Bao Fan is latest CEO to go missing    			By Michelle Toh, CNN		  Updated  5:29 AM EST, Fri February 17, 2023    Link Copied!   Bao Fan, chairman and CEO of China Renaissance, speaking in Hong Kong in September 2018.    Bobby Yip/ReutersHong KongCNN      One of China’s top investment bankers has become unreachable, according to his company.  China Renaissance, an investment bank and private equity firm based in Beijing, said in a Thursday filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it “has been unable to contact” Bao Fan, its chairman and CEO.  Shares of the company plunged as much as 50% in Hong Kong on Friday following the news. The stock closed down 28%.  “The board is not aware of any information that indicates that Mr. Bao’s unavailability is or might be related to the business and/or operations of the group,” the firm said in the filing.  Bao is known as a veteran dealmaker in China’s tech industry. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping. Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.   Bao started his investment banking career in the late 1990s at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse and later went on to serve as an adviser to the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.  His team has also invested in US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio    (NIO) and Li Auto, and helped Chinese internet giants Baidu    (BIDU) and JD.com    (JD) complete their secondary listings in Hong Kong.   Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive officer of China Renaissance Group, speaks during a Bloomberg West television interview in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Wednesday, June 15, 2016. Bao discussed Didi Chuxing's market valuation after its latest round of funding, the prospects for Uber in China and the companies he's most excited about in China. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg/GettyTop dealmaker says Chinese markets are 'close to the bottom'Bao did not immediately respond to messages from CNN on WeChat on Friday, while China Renaissance hasn’t yet responded to a request for comment.  The financial services firm recently dealt with another similar disruption, according to Caixin, a respected Chinese financial news outlet. Chinese authorities detained Cong Lin, the company’s president, in September, it reported, citing unidentified sources.China has a history of detaining execsBao’s disappearance follows those of other high-profile business leaders in China, where it is not uncommon for executives to suddenly drop off the radar with little explanation.  In 2020, real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang disappeared for several months after he allegedly spoke out against Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Ren was eventually jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.  Ren Zhiqiang, a former real estate tycoon and outspoken government critic, has been placed under investigation by the Communist Party.China Photos/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty ImagesChinese tycoon who criticized Xi Jinping's handling of coronavirus jailed for 18 yearsIn 2017, insurance giant Anbang warned shareholders that its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, wouldn’t be able to carry out his duties after he was reportedly detained by authorities as part of a government investigation. Anbang at the time cited “personal reasons” for his absence. Wu was eventually jailed for 18 years,  Also in 2017, Xiao Jianhua, a tycoon who controlled Tomorrow Holdings, was seized by Chinese security agents from his room at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong and taken to mainland China. He was sentenced in August 2022 to 13 years in prison.  Another prominent case took place in 2015, when Guo Guangchang, the billionaire dubbed “the Warren Buffett of China,” was reported as missing by the conglomerate he ran. That group, Fosun, later confirmed that Guo was assisting authorities in an investigation.   Senior executives from dozens of Chinese companies also disappeared that year. Some later returned to their positions, while others did not.

View more opinion on CNN.CNN      President Joe Biden has been criticized by members of both parties for not being more transparent and forthcoming about the decision to shoot down three aerial objects, just days after a US fighter jet took down a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of the Carolinas. But there may have been good reason for the lack of information made public in the days following the flurry of activity, and we should be patient as US authorities get to the bottom of what exactly these aerial objects are and where they originated from.  Administration officials used cryptic descriptions to describe the three objects, with one said to be an octagonal object with strings hanging off it, sparking more confusion and questions of extraterrestrial activity (which the White House press secretary ruled out on Monday).   Sailors assigned to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group 2 recover a high-altitude surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, while the Harpers Ferry-class dock landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) transits nearby, Feb. 5, 2023. (U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Tyler Thompson)Petty Officer 1st Class Tyler Thompson/US NavyOpinion: The long, strange history of spy balloonsOn Thursday, the President offered his first extensive remarks on the aerial objects, saying the three smaller ones were “most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions studying weather or conducting other scientific research.” He also mapped out four measures to detect, monitor and establish rules and regulations around unmanned objects.   Biden’s comments seemed to address the critics who argued that the administration has not shared enough information or sufficiently explained the apparent policy shift toward aerial objects in US airspace.  Earlier this week, former President Donald Trump accused Biden of having “surrendered American airspace to Communist China.” Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Biden of causing “global shame” with his response. (Biden officials have said three balloons had flown over the US during the Trump administration, though it appears Trump officials weren’t aware of the overflights.) Even Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal emerged from a classified briefing for senators on Tuesday and said, “I have a better understanding, but the American people deserve and need to know more.”   The challenge Biden faces is not new. American presidents have often struggled to strike the right balance between transparency and secrecy when dealing with national security issues.    Sometimes presidents want to avoid fueling hysteria. Certainly, this was President Dwight Eisenhower’s response when the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik-1 satellite on October 4, 1957. As public alarm mounted over the military implications of the launch, Eisenhower worked hard to contain fears. Speaking to the press days later, Eisenhower downplayed any concerns by saying there was “no additional threat to the United States … they have put one small ball in the air.”  FILE PHOTO: A jet flies by a suspected Chinese spy balloon as it floats off the coast in Surfside Beach, South Carolina, U.S. February 4, 2023.  REUTERS/Randall Hill/File PhotoRandall Hill/ReutersOpinion: What would China have done?Eisenhower underestimated the emotional impact Sputnik would have on the public, however, and Democrats weaponized the moment, comparing it to Pearl Harbor and claiming the Republican administration was not doing enough in the Cold War.   But Eisenhower’s response reflected his general disposition when it came to foreign policy and national security, as Evan Thomas documented in his book, “Ike’s Bluff.” He sought to do everything possible to avoid escalating the possibility of nuclear conflict.    Even as congressional Democrats ramped up their rhetoric about an alleged “missile gap” attributed to administration policies, Eisenhower held the line on military spending, focusing instead on investment in research and secret U-2 reconnaissance flights.  Presidents have also held back information for strategic reasons. This was certainly true in October 1962 when President John F. Kennedy initially withheld that his administration had images of Soviet missile sites being built in Cuba. This allowed the US ambassador to the UN to publicly confront the Soviet ambassador and dramatically reveal concrete evidence of what the Soviets had undertaken. The moment was important, giving the US the upper hand in persuading other countries that the Soviets were to blame for the dangerous standoff.   And then there are instances when presidents are trying to refrain from acting or making public statements in haste — to avoid unnecessary military provocations, figure out the best military path to take and be able to adjust their stance as a situation unfolds. While we valorize firm and decisive decision-making, sometimes being an effective president means being willing to learn and change as new facts and opportunities emerge.     A high altitude balloon floats over Billings, Mont., on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2023. The U.S. is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted over U.S. airspace for a couple days, but the Pentagon decided not to shoot it down due to risks of harm for people on the ground, officials said Thursday. (Larry Mayer/The Billings Gazette via AP)Larry Mayer/The Billings Gazette/APOpinion: Suspected spy balloon shows how diplomacy can go way off courseThis was certainly true with President Ronald Reagan, who after 1985 displayed considerable flexibility and caution as negotiations with the Soviet Union eventually culminated in 1987 with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). Moving through many ups and downs over a two-year period, including the need to prevent the right wing of his own party from subverting progress, was not always easy. Indeed, Reagan had to withstand fierce criticism from conservatives who accused him of falling for a trap set by old Kremlin hard-liners and practicing the sort of appeasement he built his career opposing.   But in the end, he was successful. Restraint and flexibility produced a breakthrough agreement that accelerated the demise of the Soviet Union.     None of this is to say there aren’t also terrible reasons for secrecy in national security.  Transparency is an important element of our democracy for a reason; there is a long history of American presidents withholding damaging information or conducting wrong — or even illegal — military operations, as President Richard Nixon did when he authorized secret bombings of Cambodia in 1969. In 1976, Democratic Sen. Frank Church campaigned to expose the way American presidents had relied on illegal domestic surveillance, attempted assassinations and helped overthrow foreign governments in their efforts to advance the US’ national interest.    At this point there is sufficient reason to believe Biden has not been recreating the worst kinds of presidential behavior we’ve seen in the past. By all indications, it seems Biden exercised caution in shooting down the Chinese surveillance balloon and aimed to do so in a safe manner.  It’s likely Biden wanted to show China this kind of surveillance would not be tolerated while avoiding triggering a more dangerous confrontation between two superpowers. The risks are clear as US-China relations are deteriorating and Beijing has since accused the US of flying balloons over its airspace numerous times. (The White House denied Beijing’s accusation and described the claim as an attempt at damage control.) As Max Boot argued in The Washington Post, “A healthy concern about China’s growing power is warranted, but paranoia and alarmism are not.”   On Thursday, Biden said he would make no apologies for shooting down the surveillance balloon, but stressed, “We seek competition, not conflict with China. We’re not looking for a new Cold War.”  Regarding the other downed objects, the administration was concerned about the risk to commercial flights, given that they were flying at a lower altitude than the surveillance balloon. So far, the leading theory among US intelligence officials is that they were flown for benign purposes.Get our free weekly newsletter  Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Of course, we will learn more in the coming weeks as government officials collect and sift through the remains. Biden should continue to be as upfront with the American public as he can, disclosing what is safe to share while providing reassurance.  Before Americans jump to the conclusion that this was all an example of botched foreign policy — or worse — it’s worth remembering how many presidents have, for all the right reasons, wrestled with the difficult trade-offs of transparency when dealing with matters of national security. Although it doesn’t always make for great movie plots, the complications of real-world presidential leadership can often produce messy but well-reasoned results.     This article has been updated with news of Biden’s statement on Thursday.

Now too much is risking lives    			By Hilary Whiteman, CNN		  Updated  1:00 AM EST, Fri February 17, 2023    Link Copied!   Video Ad FeedbackDrone footage shows extent of flooding as cyclone rips through New Zealand    01:54   - Source:CNNCNN      New Zealand’s Hawke’s Bay is known for its fine wine, but many of the region’s vineyards are now under water, along with homes and roads in the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle.  The weather system didn’t make landfall in New Zealand, but it caused widespread destruction, killing at least eight people, displacing thousands, destroying roads and cutting access to smaller communities in the country’s northeast.   Prime Minister Chris Hipkins flew over the flood-hit areas on Thursday and said the “extensive” damage had made it clear the country was unprepared for extreme weather events – and there is a lot of work to be done.  “We’re talking about roading, we’re talking about telecommunications, we’re talking about electricity and energy. There’s no question, we’ve got some big challenges ahead,” he said, while visiting the flood-ravaged city of Gisborne.  “We can’t continue the way that we have been going. We are going to see more of these types of weather events. So we have to be prepared.”  Flooding following Cyclone Gabrielle on February 16, 2023 in Napier, New Zealand. Kerry Marshall/Getty ImagesHipkins didn’t mention the climate crisis by name, but his climate change minister James Shaw made the link clear in an emotional address to parliament two days earlier.  “I don’t think I’ve ever felt as sad or as angry about the lost decades that we spent bickering and arguing about whether climate change was real or not,” Shaw said on Tuesday. “It is clearly here now, and if we do not act it will get worse.”  What’s made this week’s devastation so shocking is that it came just two weeks after a short, sharp deluge in Auckland, the country’s largest city of 1.7 million people.  That downpour caused flash flooding and landslides, and contributed to New Zealand’s wettest month on record –  all during what’s typically one of the driest months of the year.

Rain regularly dumped on its mountains has carved rivers that rage after downpours.   Many towns and cities sit on their banks – established to take advantage of access to ports and trade routes, which for a long time has served communities well.   “New Zealand is very good at building communities on floodplains – there’s a large fraction of the population that live close to rivers that tend to flood,” said James Renwick, a weather and climate researcher at Victoria University of Wellington. “There tends to be the attitude that we can build stop banks and that will protect the community, and it does most of the time, until you get a really big event.”  Those really big events are expected to become more frequent as global temperatures warm. New Zealand lies in the South Pacific Ocean, and is vulnerable to tropical cyclones that typically form in the north but can affect any part of the country in their path. This week, the northeast suffered the biggest hit as Cyclone Gabrielle whipped up winds and days of rain.   La Niña, a weather event that results in warmer air and sea temperatures, also contributed to Gabrielle’s strength.   Sam Dean, principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWA, said climate change is not necessarily going to increase the frequency of tropical cyclones, but it will make them more powerful.

The atmosphere is warmer and it’s holding more moisture, so there’s just more fuel, more energy available that makes them more intense, it makes them more damaging,” he said. “It makes the winds a little bit stronger. It makes the rainfall more significant.”  And cyclones like Gabrielle can form and move around just about any part of the country, he said, so the risk isn’t just in one part of the nation. “I don’t think there’s any part of New Zealand that isn’t at risk of extreme rainfall,” he said.  But heavy rainfall isn’t the only risk posed by climate change in New Zealand, long considered a safe haven by those seeking refuge from global troubles.  Parts of the country have experienced drought in recent years, and even a few years ago, Auckland – the city hit by a short bout of intense rainfall in January – was close to running out of water.“The whole area is usually very dry and very close to drought this time of year. Now it’s soaking wet,” said Daithi Stone, a climate scientist at NIWA. “But that risk of drought hasn’t gone away, (and) in our predictions of how climate change is going to affect New Zealand, that’s a feature that seems to be fairly robust –  that Northland (north of Auckland) will get drier.”  Heat waves could also become a risk in a country that’s not accustomed to unbearably hot temperatures, Stone added.   “We’re not used to heat waves … over here, it’s a novel concept. And I think we may get a fright sometime in the not too distant future,” he said.

Last year, it produced 78.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent – well below the biggest emitters, China and the United States. But the New Zealand government takes climate change seriously, and last year released its first emissions reductions plan to meet a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It also released a national adaptation plan to mitigate climate disasters in the future.  Dean, from NIWA, said Cyclone Gabrielle was likely to prompt an acceleration of that plan. “You can see an urgency to get some of these things in place and I think that’s been motivated, definitely, by this event,” he said.  A road damaged in the Napier region, New Zealand, February 2023. NZ Defence ForceRenwick, from Victoria University, said an obvious solution would be to move people away from coastlines and rivers that are at risk of more frequent flooding. But he said communities with long ties to the area will likely be reluctant to leave, and he predicted a greater emphasis on protection than relocation.   “I suspect the main response is going to be protection works rather than moving people away. So building sea walls, building levees, stop banks, putting houses up on higher piles,” he said.   During his visit to Gisborne, Hipkins said Cyclone Gabrielle had made clear to him that the country needs to improve its climate defenses.  “There’s no question that as a country we need to look at the resilience of our infrastructure. And we need to do that with a much greater sense of urgency, I think, than we have ever seen before,” he said.  That may include spending money to relocate roads subject to repeated flooding, he added.  “We actually just have to get real about some of the roads and the fact that we’re going to have to move some of those roads to places where they can be more resilient.”  But aside from adapting, as a small country, New Zealand is reliant on the biggest emitters doing more to prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius – the threshold scientists say is needed to prevent the more catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. The world is already at least 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization.  “What we need to see is China and the US, Australia, Canada, Brazil and the big emitters starting to pull their emissions down as well, and I hope we can provide a bit of inspiration, a bit of an example in this country to help other countries do the same,” Renwick said.  “We really want to stop warming the climate more because these extreme events will become overwhelming.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    WorldAudio    Live TV    Follow CNN  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.

Good luck with that.  Ahead of next week’s anniversary of the Russian invasion, US and Western leaders are gearing up for a show of unity and strength designed to establish once and for all that NATO is in the conflict for the long haul and until Moscow’s defeat.  “Russia has lost – they’ve lost strategically, operationally, and tactically,” the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said on Tuesday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned Wednesday that “Putin must realize that he cannot win” as he explained the rationale for rushing arms and ammunition to Ukrainian forces. And Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to NATO, told CNN’s Becky Anderson that Washington was doing all it could to “continue to apply pressure on Moscow to affect (Putin’s) strategic calculus.”   And in an opinion article by CNN’s Peter Bergen, retired US General and former CIA Chief David Petraeus said the conflict would end in a “negotiated resolution” when Putin realizes the war is unsustainable on the battlefield and on the home front.  The Western rhetorical and diplomatic offensive will ratchet up further as Vice President Kamala Harris heads to the Munich Security Conference this week. President Joe Biden will meanwhile visit Poland and a frontline NATO and ex-Warsaw pact state next week, bolstering his legacy of offering the most effective leadership of the Western alliance since the end of the Cold War.

His war aims of crushing Ukrainian sovereignty, capturing Kyiv, toppling an elected government, proving Russian might and severing Ukraine’s relationship with the West have backfired terribly. Russia is a pariah state and its economy is in ruins because of international sanctions. Putin is being branded a war criminal. And far from being cut off from the West, Ukraine is now in the extraordinary position of being effectively a NATO client state propped up by the US and Europe, whose survival, even if there’s an eventual ceasefire deal, will probably require decades of Western support.

(Photo by Natalia KOLESNIKOVA / AFP) (Photo by NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA/AFP via Getty Images)Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty ImagesTensions mount at the Belarus-Ukraine border amid concerns of a Russian spring offensiveYet Western logic about what is happening in the war may only disguise insight into Putin’s mindset. The Russian leader long saw the world through a different strategic and historic lens. Many foreign observers, though not in the US government, convinced themselves after all that it was not in Russia’s interest to invade Ukraine – but Putin went ahead anyway. He’s showing no sign of being deterred by a year of defeats and a stunning influx of sophisticated NATO weapons and ammunition into Ukraine. He’s sending Russian convict recruits to their deaths in futile World War I-style advances even though Russian forces have already suffered massive losses.  This war is also not some mere territorial dispute he’s likely to give up lightly. It’s born from his belief that Ukraine is not a country and must be folded into Russia. His survival in power could also depend on not being seen to have lost. And while the West says it’s in for the long haul, Putin has already been at war in Ukraine since 2014 after the annexation of Crimea.  A frozen conflict that lasts for many more years and prevents Ukraine becoming whole may be a sustainable position for him. He’s already shown he’s indifferent to massive human losses. And judging by his rhetoric he believes he’s locked into a titanic geopolitical struggle with NATO vital for Russia’s prestige. The question is whether the West has a similar appetite for the long haul.  Video Ad FeedbackSee why Ukraine thinks Russia will launch new offensive from Belarus    03:05   - Source:CNN    A crucial stage of the warAll of this explains why western strategists see the next phase of the war as critical, as Russian forces prepare for an apparent spring offensive and Ukraine awaits the arrival of recently pledged western tanks that it hopes will turn the tide.  NATO’s unity and staying power has confounded skeptics, largely due to Biden’s leadership. But political conditions in Washington and allied nations are not static and could shape Putin’s thinking.  In the US House for instance, some members of the new Republican majority are skittish. Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz last week demanded an end to aid to Ukraine and for the US to demand all combatants “reach a peace agreement immediately.” A bipartisan majority for saving Ukraine still exists in the House and the Senate. But it’s not certain Biden can guarantee massive multi-billion dollar aid packages for Ukraine in perpetuity. And US aid might be in serious doubt if ex-President Donald Trump or another Republican wins the 2024 election.  So while Ukraine’s backers hope for breakthroughs on the battlefield, months more bloody fighting seem likely.  CNN’s Jim Sciutto reported this week that the US and its allies believed that Russia’s coming offensive was unlikely to result in major battlefield gains. “It’s likely more aspirational than realistic,” said a senior US military official. There are also doubts whether Ukrainian forces have the capacity to sever entrenched Russian defenses in the east and southern areas in a way that could threaten Putin’s land bridges to Crimea. And Stoltenberg said Wednesday at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels that the conflict was becoming a “grinding war of attrition” as he called on the allies to rush ammunition to Ukraine.  Video Ad FeedbackRussian mothers gather to send Putin a message about their sons fighting in war    01:57   - Source:CNN    Putin doesn’t think he’s losingThe outside world knows Putin is not contemplating defeat or an exit from the war because of the complete lack of any diplomatic framework for ceasefire talks.  Stoltenberg said on Wednesday that there’s no prospect of this situation changing any time soon.  “President Putin shows no sign that he is preparing for peace. On the contrary, he is launching new offensives and targeting civilians, cities and critical infrastructure,” Stoltenberg said in Brussels.  Fiona Hill, a leading expert on Russia and Putin, who worked in Trump’s White House, said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday that there were few signs Putin’s determination is waning.  “I think this is a pretty grim picture, in part because Putin didn’t feel deterred in the first place,” Hill said. “The other thing is that Putin also feels that he has a lot of support from the rest of the world, including from China … it may very well take countries like China, pushing Russia, for there to be any break in Putin’s resolve.”  The prospect of China leaning on Putin for an end to the war was remote even before the lurch in US-China relations caused by the flight of a Chinese spy balloon across the US this month.  And even if Beijing might be embarrassed at Putin’s performance in Ukraine after the two sides declared a “no limits” partnership last year, it may see an advantage in seeing the US preoccupied with a proxy war against Russia as it escalates its challenge to American power in Asia.  US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman however warned Beijing on Wednesday that a long-term bet on Putin would only deliver disappointment.  “You’re going to end up with an albatross around your neck,” Sherman said at an event at the Brookings Institution, though admitted the US was concerned about tightening ties between China and Russia at a time when it is locked in simultaneous showdowns with each power.  “The Ukrainians are going to deliver a strategic failure for Putin. And that’s going to create a lot of problems for those who are supporting this unholy invasion going forward,” she said.  The problem however is that there’s no sign yet that Putin agrees.

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesCNN      A senior FBI official warned secretaries of state from across the US Thursday that Chinese hackers pose a “growing threat” and said their willingness to target the infrastructure of political parties ahead of the 2022 election demonstrates that “we could see more significant Chinese cyber activity against your states in the coming year.”  Chinese state backed-hackers are part of “a sea of things we’re concerned” about, Cynthia Kaiser, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s Cyber Division, said at a National Association of Secretaries of State conference in Washington, DC.  In the weeks before the 2022 midterm elections, Chinese hackers scanned US political parties’ IT systems in possible reconnaissance for follow-on hacking, prompting the FBI to brief both parties, CNN and the Washington Post previously reported.  It was unclear if there were any compromises from the activity, which may have been the sort of routine espionage that state actors often conduct ahead of elections.   The FBI’s concerns about Chinese cyber-espionage come amid broader tensions with Beijing over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that the US military shot down February 4.  The Chinese Embassy in Washington denied Kaiser’s allegations in a statement to CNN Thursday night.  “We do not encourage, support or connive at cyber attacks,” the Chinese Embassy said in its statement, which accused the US government of conducting its own hacking campaigns.   Kaiser gave the warning about Chinese hacking in remarks to election officials that covered potential threats from Russia, Iran and cybercriminals to US state and local networks, including election infrastructure.   The potential for Russia to target state and local computer systems remains a “significant concern” for US officials, Kaiser said.    “We don’t have any intelligence that Russia is looking to target state and local or election systems more directly than before,” she added. “But we’re certainly aware of … the possibility and have a very low threshold for sharing that information.”  The 2022 midterm elections drew some attempts at foreign meddling, including online influence operations, US officials say, but nothing that prevented people from voting or altered their votes.   Domestic unrest in Iran and Russia’s war in Ukraine may have distracted Tehran and Moscow from making more of an effort to influence or interfere in the 2022 US midterm election, a top US military cyber official told reporters in December.  The FBI has accused Beijing of having a bigger hacking program than all other countries combined. China routinely denies such allegations.  In separate activity, the US Secret Service in December accused Chinese government-linked hackers of stealing at least $20 million in US government coronavirus relief by raiding unemployment insurance funds and Small Business Administration loan money.   The FBI believes that activity was done for the “financial benefit” of the Chinese hackers, Kaiser said Thursday.  “But both things can be true: They can conduct a campaign because they want to make money, but they can also share that [information] back with the Chinese government,” Kaiser told election officials.  This story has been updated with additional details.

China sanctions Lockheed, Raytheon after vowing to retaliate against US restrictions    			By Wayne Chang and Simone McCarthy, CNN		  Updated  1:06 AM EST, Fri February 17, 2023    Link Copied!   A row of Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II aircraft is seen onboard Britain's HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier at Changi Naval Base in Singapore on October 11, 2021. Edgar Su/Reuters/FILEHong KongCNN      China has imposed sanctions on two American defense manufacturers over arms sales to Taiwan, a day after Beijing pledged to take “countermeasures” in response to Washington’s handling of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that entered American airspace and was shot down by US forces earlier this month.  Lockheed    (LMT) Martin Corporation and Raytheon    (RTN) Missiles & Defense, a subsidiary of Raytheon    (RTN) Technologies Corp, will be added to China’s sanctions list, its Ministry of Commerce said in a Thursday statement. They are banned from importing, exporting and investing in China.  Lockheed makes the F-22 Raptor fighter, the model that was responsible for shooting down the Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina on February 4. Raytheon makes the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, which was used in the mission.  China has insisted that the sanctions were not related to the “unmanned airship incident.” Its Ministry of Commerce released a statement on Friday morning saying the measures were part of “normal law enforcement action” for arms sales by the two entities to Taiwan that “seriously undermined” China’s national security and territorial integrity.  The sanctions came just days after the US Commerce Department restricted six Chinese companies that it said were tied to the Chinese army’s aerospace program from obtaining US technology without government authorization.   Both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Missiles & Defense are also subject to fines “twice the amount” of their arms sales to Taiwan dating back to September 2020, and their senior executives will be prohibited from entering and working in China.  It was not immediately clear how Beijing would enforce the fines. While the United States prohibits the sale of weapons to China, some US defense contractors have ties to civilian sectors.  “We do business with more than 70 nations around the world, and all of our international sales are strictly regulated by the US government,” a Lockheed Martin spokesperson told CNN in a statement.  Raytheon Missiles & Defense did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.  Beijing has previously imposed sanctions on both companies in relation to their arms sales to Taiwan, without specifying what the penalties would entail and how they would be enforced. China’s ruling Communist Party views democratic Taiwan as its territory, despite never having controlled it.  In its Friday statement, China’s commerce ministry confirmed this was the first time it had used its “unreliable entity list” to impose sanctions on two companies that sell arms to Taiwan.  Political tension has risen between the United States and China over the balloon, which Beijing maintains was a civilian research aircraft blown off course.   Washington has since accused China of overseeing an international aerial surveillance program. Beijing has denied those claims and, in turn, this week accused the United States of “illegally” flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace more than 10 times since the start of 2022, including over its western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet.  US intelligence officials are assessing the possibility that the suspected spy balloon was not deliberately maneuvered over the continental US by the Chinese government, but was diverted off course, CNN reported on Wednesday.  The incident has already sent ties into a downward spiral and resulted in the postponement of an expected visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China earlier this month. The trip was expected to help ease tension between the two powers following a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in Bali in November.  In remarks Thursday, Biden said he expected to speak to Xi following the balloon incident to “get to the bottom of this” but said he made “no apologies” for “taking down that balloon.”   The United States will continue to engage with China, he said, reiterating his position that the US seeks “competition not conflict.” The current situation “underscores the importance of maintaining open lines of communication” between US and Chinese diplomats and military professionals, Biden added.

Deputy US Attorney General Lisa Monaco speaks about the May 2021 Darkside Ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline during a news conference at the Justice Department in WashingtonJONATHAN ERNST/AFP/POOL/Getty ImagesCNN      US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco on Thursday announced a joint Justice Department and Commerce Department “strike force” aimed at preventing US adversaries from attaining American technology. The Disruptive Technology Strike Force will use intelligence and data analytics, Monaco said in a speech at the policy institute Chatham House in London, to target bad actors around the world, to harden supply chains so that technology won’t be transferred to adversarial nations, and to quickly identify threats to critical American technology.  “Any company doing business in China for that matter is subject to Chinese national security laws, which requires turning over data to the state, and there is a reason we need to be very concerned,” Monaco said.  “The bottom line is that China has been quite clear that they are trying to mold and put forward the use and norms around technology that advance their privilege and their interests,” the deputy attorney general added. “Their interests, which are not consistent with our own. Their interests, which are fueled by and directed toward an authoritarian approach to their government. And that is not consistent with ours.”  Because of those concerns, Monaco said: “I don’t use TikTok, and I would not advise anyone to do so.”  The social media app TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance, one of the most valuable private companies in China, has said its Chinese employees do have access to US user data but has denied that the company is influenced by Beijing.  The concern over Chinese technology has come to a head in Washington, particularly over TikTok. US officials have raised concerns that China could use its laws to pressure TikTok to hand over US user data that could be used for intelligence or disinformation purposes, prompting the federal government and more than half of US states to ban the app from government devices.    The new task force will work with global allies to pool intelligence and hamper national security risks, Monaco said in London.  “Today, autocrats seek tactical advantage through the acquisition, use, and abuse of disruptive technology: innovations fueling the next generation of military and national security capabilities,” Monaco said, according to her prepared speech, specifically noting the threat posed by the Chinese government.   “They want to acquire technology by any means possible – not only to fuel surveillance and repression at home and abroad, but to gain strategic dominance,” she continued, saying that the Justice Department is “deploying all its tools to respond to nation states who would exploit technology to undermine our alliances, our national security and the rule of law.”  “Our goal is simple but essential,” Monaco said, “to strike back against adversaries trying to siphon our best technology.”   The new task force comes as the US conflict with China takes center stage in the public eye. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have heightened over the past several weeks after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floating in American airspace was shot down. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his trip to China after the incident, and Beijing has in turn accused the US of “illegally” flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace more than 10 times since the start of last year.  Monaco said during her speech Thursday that China’s ability to collect and weaponize data abroad is deeply concerning – particularly the Chinese law that mandates any company doing business in China to make its data accessible to the government there.  “If a company operating in China collects your data, it is a good bet that the Chinese government is accessing it,” Monaco said.  She added that because of artificial intelligence and algorithms, China’s capability to monitor and use that data around the world is becoming increasingly sophisticated, saying, “The data obtained today could be used in new and frightening ways tomorrow.”   RelatedAd FeedbackAd Feedback Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackAd Feedback Search  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account  Live TV  Audio  WorldAfrica    Americas    Asia    Australia    China    Europe    India    Middle East    United KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden Presidency    Facts First    US ElectionsBusinessMarkets    Tech    Media    Success    Perspectives    VideosHealthLife, But Better    Fitness    Food    Sleep    Mindfulness    RelationshipsEntertainmentMovies    Television    CelebrityTechInnovate    Gadget    Foreseeable Future    Mission: Ahead    Upstarts    Work Transformed    Innovative CitiesStyleArts    Design    Fashion    Architecture    Luxury    Beauty    VideoTravelDestinations    Food & Drink    Stay    News    VideosSportsFootball    Tennis    Golf    Motorsport    US Sports    Olympics    Climbing    Formula E    Esports    HockeyVideosLive TV    Digital Studios    CNN Films    HLN    TV Schedule    TV Shows A-Z    CNNVRFeaturesAs Equals    Call to Earth    Freedom Project    Impact Your World    Inside Africa    2 Degrees    CNN Heroes    All FeaturesWeatherClimate    Storm Tracker    Wildfire Tracker    VideoMorePhotos    Longform    Investigations    CNN Profiles    CNN Leadership    CNN Newsletters    Work for CNN    Audio    Live TV    Follow CNN Politics  Log InMy Account    SettingsLog Out  Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account    Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesAccessibility & CCAboutNewslettersTranscripts  © 2023 Cable News Network.
