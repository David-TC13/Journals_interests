"Xi calls for guiding healthy, high-quality development of private sector - People's Daily Online","Xi calls for guiding healthy, high-quality development of private sector (Xinhua) 09:05, March 08, 2023BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited on Monday afternoon national political advisors from the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), who are attending the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).Xi participated in their joint panel discussion and heard their comments and suggestions. He stressed that the CPC Central Committee always stays committed to unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector of the economy, and at the same time unswervingly encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector of the economy. The non-public sector´s status and functions in the country´s economic and social development have not changed, the principle and policies to unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the sector have not changed, and the principle and policies to provide a sound environment and more opportunities to the sector have not changed. The CPC Central Committee has always considered private enterprises and private entrepreneurs as being in our ranks. Efforts should be made to guide private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to understand the principles and policies of the CPC Central Committee, and boost their confidence and unburden them of their worries, so that they can ambitiously pursue development, and therefore the healthy, high-quality development of the private sector can be achieved.Ahead of International Women´s Day, which is celebrated on March 8, Xi, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended holiday greetings and best wishes to female deputies to the National People´s Congress (NPC), female members of the CPPCC National Committee, and female staff of the two sessions. Greetings and best wishes were also extended to women from all ethnic groups and sectors of society on the Chinese mainland, to female compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas.Those who joined Xi in the visit and the discussion included Wang Huning, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and presides over the meetings of the presidium of the first session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, and Cai Qi and Ding Xuexiang, also members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.During the joint panel discussion, CPPCC members Zeng Yuqun, Xie Dong, Liu Zhendong, Chen Xiaoping, Xie Ru and Sun Dongsheng made remarks regarding topics on developing a globally competitive new energy industry, providing financial support for scientific and technological innovation, creating a better environment for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, promoting the high-quality development of platform economy, advancing the revitalization of rural industries, and how to give full play to the strengths and vitality of the private sector.Xi made an important speech after listening carefully to the members. He said he was pleased to visit and have discussions with national political advisors from the CNDCA and the ACFIC. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, he extended sincere greetings to those who were present, to members of the CNDCA and the ACFIC and individuals from the non-public sector of the economy, and to all CPPCC members.Xi stressed that the year 2022 was an extremely crucial year of great importance in the history of the CPC and the country. Faced with high winds and choppy waters in the international environment and multiple greater-than-expected factors at home, with all the Chinese people meeting difficulties head-on and striving in unity, we secured some accomplishments of major significance and far-reaching influence, resulting in substantial achievements in advancing the cause of the Party and the country.The CPC successfully convened its 20th National Congress, drawing an ambitious blueprint for building a modern socialist country in all respects. We overcame difficulties and challenges including the COVID-19 epidemic, and safely and successfully hosted the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics as scheduled. We dynamically optimized and adjusted the measures and policies for COVID-19 prevention and control, securing a smooth transition within a relatively short period of time. As a result, China´s mortality rate of COVID-19 has been kept at the lowest level globally. We have scored a major and decisive victory in our response to COVID-19. We fully and faithfully applied the new development philosophy on all fronts and focused on fostering a new development pattern and promoting high-quality development. While the global inflation reached a new high in over four decades, consumer prices in China remained stable in general. China´s economic growth for the whole year was 3 percent, which is quite high among major economies in the world. All these achievements did not come easily.Xi pointed out that the past five years since the 19th CPC National Congress have been truly momentous and extraordinary. The external environment for China´s development has changed drastically, with uncertainties and unexpected factors increasing remarkably. In particular, Western countries headed by the United States have contained, encircled and suppressed China in an all-round way, bringing unprecedentedly severe challenges to China´s development. At the same time, China has also faced various difficulties such as the resurging COVID-19 epidemic and the mounting downward pressure facing the domestic economy.Adhering to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, we have met obstacles and difficulties head on and responded to them calmly, remained unswayed by fallacies, not cowed by pressure or hardships. China´s GDP registered an annual growth rate of 5.2 percent over the past five years. We won the critical battle against poverty as scheduled and finished building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, thus attaining the First Centenary Goal, achieving impressive advances in the cause of the Party and the country, and taking China on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects. The achievements of the past five years should be attributed to the concerted efforts of the whole Party and the Chinese people, as well as to the contribution of the CPPCC members.Xi stressed that, in the face of profound and complex changes in the international and domestic environment, we must remain calm, maintain firm resolve, pursue progress while ensuring stability, demonstrate enterprise in our work, unite as one, and have the courage to carry on our fight. To remain calm and maintain firm resolve means to keep a cool head in observing the profound changes in the international landscape, and calmly respond to various risks and challenges. We should accurately identify, soundly respond to, and actively steer changes, and timely optimize and adjust our strategies and policies. At the same time, we should maintain firm strategic resolve, stay tenacious, never be afraid of any risks, and move forward firmly toward the established strategic plans. To sustain progress while ensuring stability and demonstrate enterprise in our work means to maintain stability in our general direction, principles and polices, as well as strategic plans. On the basis of securing our foundation and position, we must forge ahead vigorously, move forward as fast as possible and strive for the best possible results.We should unite as one and have the courage to carry on our fight as we draw our strengths from unity. Over the years, we have encountered various risks, challenges and battles one after another, and have overcome every one of them with all the people striving in unity and fighting tenaciously. In the near future, we will only face more and increasingly serious risks and challenges. Only when all the people work together with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and have the courage and ability to carry out our fight, will we continue to win new and greater victories.Xi pointed out that the private sector is an important force for our Party to maintain its long-term governance and to unite and lead the people of all ethnic groups to realize the Two Centenary Goals and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. We always regard private enterprises and private entrepreneurs as being in our ranks, giving them support when they are in difficulties and offering them guidance when they are uncertain about what to do. We should improve the development environment for private enterprises, remove the institutional obstacles that prevent them from fairly participating in market competition, and safeguard the property rights of private enterprises and the rights and the interests of private entrepreneurs according to law. We should substantiate the requirement that state-owned enterprises and their private counterparts should be treated equally through institutional arrangements and legal guarantee to encourage and support the development of the private sector and growth of private enterprises, and boost market expectations and confidence.It is necessary to give full play to the important role of private enterprises in stabilizing employment and boosting income, take more effective measures to support the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed individuals, and support the platform companies to play an active role in creating jobs, expanding consumption and competing in the global market. Work should be done to fully establish a cordial and clean relationship between government and businesses, and resolve concerns and difficulties for private companies and private entrepreneurs, so that they could be given a free hand and concentrate on development with no worries. It is also necessary to strengthen theoretical and political guidance, help private companies and private entrepreneurs properly perceive the Party Central Committee´s principles and policies of unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector, unswervingly encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector, as well as promoting the healthy growth of the non-public sector of the economy and encouraging those working in this sector to achieve success, so that they can let go of misgivings, be unburdened and develop with courage.Xi stressed that the pursuit of high-quality development places higher requirements on the private sector. Private enterprises should put into practice the new development philosophy, thoroughly understand the shortcomings existing in and challenges faced by the private sector, so that they can transform their growth model, adjust industrial structure and shift to new growth drivers, stick to the main business, strengthen their industries and consciously take the path of high-quality development. Those who have the ability and the conditions should strengthen self-dependent innovation to play a greater role in promoting sci-tech self-reliance and strength and the application of sci-tech achievements.Efforts should be made to unleash the vitality of private investment, and encourage and attract more private capital to take part in the development of major projects and programs in key industrial and supply chains, enabling such capital to make a greater contribution to fostering a new development pattern and promoting high-quality development. Work should be done to regulate and guide the sound development of all types of capital in accordance with law, and effectively prevent and defuse systematic financial risks, with the goal of creating an environment for enterprises under all forms of ownership to compete equally and grow together.Xi pointed out that Chinese modernization is meant to realize common prosperity for all Chinese people. Both state-owned enterprises and their private counterparts are important forces for promoting common prosperity. Both should take their social responsibilities in this regard. He called on private entrepreneurs to strengthen their sentiment and concern for the country and the people, and consciously apply people-centered development philosophy, and have a strong sense of responsibility and mission to help others get rich and promote common prosperity.Xi said that private enterprises should strive to build harmonious internal labor relations and foster an employees' community with shared interest, making sure that the achievements of private enterprises' development can equally benefit all staff members. He underlined the requirement that private enterprises and private entrepreneurs should adhere to the bottom line that their business operations must be in compliance with law and regulations, carry forward the fine spirit of entrepreneurship, and act as patriotic and dedicated role models who always abide by law in business operations, actively start up businesses while seeking innovation, and repay the society. Private enterprises and private entrepreneurs are called on to pass on and further develop traditional Chinese virtues, actively join in and initiate social charities, being responsible, righteous and benevolent while being wealthy.Shi Taifeng, He Lifeng, Hao Mingjin, Gao Yunlong and others were present.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218509.html,8,3,2023,"['private', 'development', 'sector', 'enterprises', 'committee', 'xi', 'china', 'cpc', 'high', 'central', 'national', 'entrepreneurs', 'members', 'quality', 'public', 'country', 'environment', 'party', 'political', 'cppcc']",0.4149839427711765,0.11924574007552736,8/3/2023
Hezbollah leader decries U.S. as partner in Lebanon's corruption - People's Daily Online,"Hezbollah leader decries U.S. as partner in Lebanon´s corruption (Xinhua) 11:14, March 10, 2023BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon´s Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Thursday lashed out at the United States and called on the Lebanese to find solutions to their country´s crises instead of bowing to international pressures.Acknowledging that ""those behind corruption in Lebanon are Lebanese,"" the Hezbollah´s leader said, ""America is a partner in corruption"" in the country.""America is preventing deposits, loans and investments from coming to Lebanon,"" Nasrallah decried in a televised address, according to local English news website Naharnet.He vowed that Hezbollah would not surrender, urging the need for cooperation and courage in finding solutions to the economic and political crisis in the country.Since 2019, Lebanon has been struggling with unprecedented financial and economic crises that have led to the devaluation of the local currency by more than 95 percent, plunging over 80 percent of the population into poverty.Lebanon is also suffering from the political impasse over presidential election after President Michel Aoun finished his six-year term in October last year. The parliament has failed for 11 times over the past six months to elect a new president for lack of consensus among political parties.Political gridlock has slowed down the efforts to implement structural reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a bailout loan amounting to 3 billion U.S. dollars which could lead the country back to recovery.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219946.html,10,3,2023,"['lebanon', 'hezbollah', 'country', 'political', 'leader', 'corruption', 'partner', 'nasrallah', 'lebanese', 'solutions', 'crises', 'international', 'america', 'local', 'economic', 'president', 'decries', 'beirut', 'sayyed', 'hassan']",0.24095719095719093,0.05384800384800385,10/3/2023

(Photo by Nick Wagner/ Xinhua)""It is heartbreaking to hear there could be a return to the Trump-era use of this practice,"" says Leecia Welch.NEW YORK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is considering reviving the practice of detaining migrant families who cross the border illegally, the same policy the president shut down over the past two years because he wanted a more humane immigration system, reported The New York Times (NYT) on Monday.Although no final decision has been made, the move would be a stark reversal for Biden, who came into office promising to adopt a more compassionate approach to the border after the harsh policies of his predecessor, former President Donald J. Trump, said the report.The Biden administration has largely ended the practice of family detention, instead releasing families into the United States temporarily and using ankle bracelets, traceable cellphones or other methods to keep track of them, according to the report.""But the administration has turned to more restrictive measures as it struggles to handle a rise in migrants fleeing authoritarian governments and economic ruin in their countries.

"Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases - People's Daily Online","Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases (Xinhua) 12:07, March 11, 2023BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing ""two sessions"" in Beijing hold great significance not only for China´s own development but also for other nations interested in understanding China´s future growth trajectory and global impact.The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual sessions of China´s National People´s Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which are the country´s top legislature and national political advisory body, respectively.China´s opening-up policy remains one of the most discussed topics at the political event this year. The government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation demonstrates the steady progress and China´s impressive determination on the policy, saying that ""We remained committed to opening up wider to the world and expanded international economic and trade cooperation to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes.""As an Egyptian living in China for years, I have witnessed the country´s wider opening-up pursuit, and I believe an open China is vital to the struggling global economic recovery.STORIES BEHIND ""THINNER"" SUITCASESI have friends of different nationalities who share the same feeling that our suitcases are ""thinner"" these days when returning to China from holidays. Over a decade ago, my family would always stuff my suitcase with cheese, dates, spices and other local specialties before I returned to China.Now, however, more global products are entering the Chinese market through platforms such as the China International Import Expo (CIIE). With Arab specialties including Egyptian oranges, dates from the United Arab Emirates and essential oils from Syria easily available in Chinese supermarkets, I no longer need to carry these things all the way to China.According to the government work report, China developed new forms of foreign trade over the past five years and built 152 new integrated pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce. Major trade events such as CIIE, the China Import and Export Fair, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the China International Consumer Products Expo have delivered positive results.Furthermore, China simplified customs clearance procedures and reduced the clearance time for imports and exports by 67 percent and 92 percent, respectively, bringing about a significant reduction in related compliance costs, the work report added.Amidst the growing trend of trade protectionism and the so-called ""decoupling and severing industrial and supply chains"" by some developed countries, China´s efforts toward trade liberalization and facilitation have become increasingly crucial.With an enormous market of more than 1.4 billion people, China is the world´s largest goods trader, a major trading partner of over 140 countries and regions, and has the world´s second-largest consumer market and import market. There is no doubt that China is a key hub of the global economic cycle, benefiting the entire world with the dividends of its super-sized market.STRONG MAGNET FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT""Intensifying efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment,"" as stated in the government work report, is one of the key priorities of the Chinese government´s economic work in 2023.During my over a decade-long experience of living in China, I have seen an increasing number of international companies investing in the country. When enterprises first entered China, most of them just regarded it as the ""factory of the world."" But later many of these companies set up research and development centers here to continuously increase the added value of their industrial chains.In 2022, foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 8 percent year on year to 189.13 billion U.S. dollars, reinforcing its status as a magnet for foreign investors.Among Arab countries, Gulf countries' investment in China is particularly eye-catching. Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Kuwait National Petroleum Company and other energy giants have carried out in-depth investment cooperation with many Chinese provinces and enterprises.China and Arab countries have adhered to pursuing mutual benefits, promoted trade and investment facilitation, and multiplied the growth of mutual investment and economic and trade cooperation, according to the Saudi Arabian newspaper Alriyadh.The sovereign wealth funds of Gulf states have long been mainly invested in developed markets in Europe and the United States. In recent years, as China-Arab relations have continued to improve and their economic ties deepened, China´s market and assets are gradually favored by sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.In 2018, Abu Dhabi Global Market, an international financial center in Abu Dhabi, opened its first overseas representative office in Beijing.Ajlan &Bros Holding Group, a leading investment holding company in the Middle East and one of the largest private enterprises of Saudi Arabia in China, has been doing business in China for more than 20 years. With the increasingly close economic and trade exchanges between China and Saudi Arabia, the company has set up four investment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong since 2017.Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) has jumped onto the bandwagon of China´s green development. The company announced a carbon-neutral strategy and plans to actively expand investment cooperation in China.""We need to 'join hands' with each other instead of 'letting go' of each other´s hands. We need to 'tear down walls,' not 'erect walls.'"" I was deeply impressed by these inspiring words by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and I believe China walks its talk.A sentence in the government work report fully expresses China´s confidence in attracting more foreign investment, saying that with a vast and open market, China is sure to provide even greater business opportunities for foreign companies in China.MORE FRIENDS, MORE CHANCESThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has attracted more than three-quarters of the world´s countries and 32 international organizations.Over the past decade, Chinese companies have invested 397.9 billion yuan (about 57 billion U.S. dollars) in cooperation zones built in countries along the Belt and Road, creating 421,000 local jobs.The BRI has made significant contributions to Egypt´s modernization process and a notable example is the country´s new administrative capital.A modern city is taking shape in the desert east of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. Constructed by a Chinese company, the Central Business District (CBD) in Egypt´s new administrative capital boasts the tallest building in Africa, standing at 385.8 meters.This achievement is a testament to the growing friendship between Egypt and China. The project is nearing completion within just over four years. According to Egypt´s Al-Ahram newspaper, ""China speed"" makes Egypt´s dream come true.From material selection to the application of technologies, the project embodies the concept of green development and can help Cairo effectively deal with air pollution and other ""big city diseases.""The CBD in Egypt´s new administrative capital has become a popular spot, bustling with visitors. I would go there every time I go back to Egypt.The outcomes of high-quality BRI development are spread across Africa. I have experienced the Chinese-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway. From the station to the trains, I was struck by the modern scene around me. Passengers were enjoying the convenience and efficiency of the self-service ticket vending machines, while the crew provided excellent services.China´s high-level opening-up has been a continuous success, and the BRI has become an international public good and a platform for international cooperation, Karim Adel, head of the Cairo-based Al Adl Center for Economic and Strategic Studies, told Xinhua.China´s other initiatives, especially the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, have also won the support of many countries, Adel added.Last year, I had the privilege of participating in the translation and review work of the Arabic version of the fourth volume of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China."" With every word I read, I gained a deeper appreciation for the thoughts of the Chinese leader.In 2021, Xi said that on the road to the well-being of all humankind, no country or nation should be left behind. All countries and nations are equally entitled to development opportunities and rights to development, Xi said at the Communist Party of China and World Political Parties Summit. His words deeply touched me.There is an Arabic proverb that goes, ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together,"" just like how in China people often say ""more friends, more chances.""China is a country committed to high-level opening-up and I firmly believe that its efforts will bring more concrete opportunities to the world. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220517.html,11,3,2023,"['china', 'investment', 'international', 'trade', 'countries', 'development', 'economic', 'market', 'egypt', 'global', 'work', 'foreign', 'national', 'country', 'cooperation', 'company', 'opening', 'government', 'report', 'years']",0.3515372474747474,0.1370012626262626,11/3/2023
UN watchdog chief's visit raises hopes of reviving Iran nuclear deal - People's Daily Online,"UN watchdog chief´s visit raises hopes of reviving Iran nuclear deal (Xinhua) 09:47, March 10, 2023TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The visit to Iran last week by the UN nuclear watchdog chief following weeks of high tension between the two sides seemed to have witnessed the calm after the storm, reflecting a bilateral willingness to resolve issues and raising hopes of reviving a 2015 nuclear deal, Iranian analysts said.Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, the capital of Iran, during March 3-4 and discussed issues of contention with senior Iranian officials.The outcome of the trip was a joint statement by the two sides, the main features of which were their pledge to continue interactions ""in a spirit of collaboration"" and Iran´s greater openness to the agency´s inspections.""NEW CHAPTER OPENED""""A new chapter was opened in the cooperation between Iran and the agency,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Monday, two days after Grossi finished his visit.Describing Grossi´s visit as part of the efforts to pave the way for all parties' return to the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Kanaani expressed hope that the ""good agreements"" reached during Grossi´s trip would prepare the ground for the resolution of technical differences.The visit came amid the differences between Iran and the IAEA that had peaked in previous weeks, mainly over claims that Iran ""enriched uranium to a level close to 84 percent"" and its ""noncooperation"" with the agency with regard to the ""three undeclared sites"" where ""traces of uranium"" had allegedly been found. Iran rejected the first claim as ""inaccurate"" and the second as ""baseless.""It is worth noting that Grossi´s visit came after months of criticisms by the agency of ""Iran´s lack of cooperation"" and a few days ahead of a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, where in November last year, a resolution proposed by the United States, Britain, France and Germany had been passed calling on Iran to collaborate with the agency´s investigators regarding ""uranium traces,"" all said to be among the outstanding issues causing a standstill in the nuclear negotiations that started in Vienna in April 2021.Despite some skepticism voiced domestically of the trip and the intentions behind it, the visit drew upbeat responses from Iranian officials, media, analysts and especially the country´s forex market where the national currency, the rial, started gaining against the U.S. dollar after days of unprecedented depreciation.RESOLVING DIFFERENCESIn remarks to the official news agency IRNA, Jalil Rahimi Jahanabadi, a member of the Iranian Parliament´s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said Grossi´s visit was mainly a ""political"" one aimed at alleviating the agency´s concerns about Iran´s nuclear activities and reassure the West that Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon.He expressed optimism that the visit would prepare the ground for the closure of the case about Iran´s nuclear activities for good.Remarks by Grossi on the sidelines of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting on Monday seemed to support the optimism, as he said no ""production"" or ""accumulation"" of highly enriched uranium has been found by the agency´s inspectors in Iran.When the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors came to an end on Wednesday, no anti-Iran resolution was issued despite the hue and cry by the E3 group of France, Britain and Germany as well as Israel over the past weeks.During his meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on Saturday, Grossi described as ""very constructive and positive"" his meetings with Iranian officials during the visit, saying they will prepare the ground favorably for future interaction and expanded cooperation between the two sides.At a joint press conference earlier in the day with President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Mohammad Eslami, Grossi stressed that the cooperation between the agency and Iran and the ""good agreement"" the two sides were expected to reach would be of contribution to the JCPOA´s revival.RESUMING NEGOTIATIONS?Reza Nasri, an international affairs analyst, told the semi-official ILNA news agency that the differences between Iran and IAEA were cited as the main obstacle to the continuation of the negotiations.At present, Iran has proved that it is not the side to blame for the failure to resume the nuclear talks, he said, noting Tehran can use the ""technical agreements"" with the agency as important political leverage in the process of reviving the JCPOA, waiting for the other parties to keep their side of the bargain.On the possibility of Grossi´s visit resulting in the JCPOA´s revival, Javid Qorban-Oghli, former Iranian ambassador to South Africa, told Iranian Ham-Mihan newspaper that unless Iran and the IAEA resolve their differences, it will not be possible to restore the nuclear agreement.""I do not seek to say (the visit) will lead to the JCPOA´s revival, but when Grossi points to such a possibility, it is a positive sign,"" the former diplomat said.An analysis by the official Iranian newspaper Jomhouri-e Eslami (Islamic Republic) was another upbeat voice heard following Grossi´s visit, as it said what took place during the IAEA chief´s trip has increased the likelihood of the JCPOA´s revival.""It appears that the recent agreements reached between AEOI and IAEA would be enough to help resolve the disputes between the two sides for the time being, ... thus smoothing the path for the resumption of the nuclear talks,"" the newspaper said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219803.html,10,3,2023,"['iran', 'visit', 'agency', 'grossi', 'nuclear', 'iranian', 'iaea', 'jcpoa', 'sides', 'tehran', 'trip', 'cooperation', 'differences', 'uranium', 'meeting', 'revival', 'chief', 'reviving', 'deal', 'weeks']",0.3440064102564103,0.08151806526806525,10/3/2023
Interview: China women's basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China women´s basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics (Xinhua) 13:33, March 09, 2023BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Making the move from player to head coach in women´s basketball is no easy feat, to say nothing of making it to the final of a World Cup as both a player and a head coach.So Zheng Wei has many reasons to be proud of herself.The current head coach of China´s women´s basketball team steered her squad to second place at the FIBA Women´s World Cup last year, tying the country´s best record in the tournament. She was also part of the China team which reached the final of the World Championships in 1994.In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Zheng told her story of getting over regrets during a career spanning 28 years.UNFORGETTABLE FIBA 2022 WORLD CUPDuring the last Olympic cycle, China were widely considered serious medal contenders at major world competitions, but failed to prove their prowess at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.""In Tokyo, we were rallied past and eliminated by Serbia,"" Zheng recalled.What made the year 2021 even more poignant for Zheng´s team was that they were defeated by Japan in the Asian Cup final.""Because of these setbacks my players really wanted to move a step forward and reach a new level,"" said Zheng.For Zheng, the underperformance was somehow reminiscent of the 1994 World Championships, where China missed out on the title after losing to Brazil in the final.""It was the closest China´s women´s basketball team had ever come to winning the world title. We defeated Australia to set up a final showdown with Brazil,"" said Zheng.""We had never lost to Brazil in previous games, so we felt like we were already the world champions.""But because we were mentally unprepared and too eager for success, we didn't play our best in that game and left with regrets,"" she added.28 years later, Zheng made up for her regrets, even though the young China side she coached also finished runners-up at the World Cup after losing to the United States in the final.Speaking of last year´s World Cup journey, Zheng mentioned the quarterfinal against France and the semifinal against Australia as the two most unforgettable games, as the former represented a breakthrough for the team, while the latter showcased her players' tenacity and resilience.""It was the best game that France played throughout the World Cup. Their shooting percentage was very high, and it was tough,"" said Zheng.""But our players had prepared for that moment for years. Everyone held their breath and didn't want to leave with regrets.""After breaking through this barrier, the players became more confident,"" she added.In the match against hosts Australia, China withstood pressure even though they were playing without top scorer Li Meng.""When the opportunity came, everyone´s determination to move forward did not change. Although Li Meng did not play, everyone else stepped up and took responsibility,"" Zheng noted.""I think it was willpower that helped us. Australia were a more experienced team, but by the fourth quarter, they couldn't keep up with us.""From the group stage to the final, Zheng´s players kept surprising her with fantastic performances. ""Maybe after breaking through that window, they couldn't be stopped. They did their best to present both technique and spirit on the court. I think there was no regret this time,"" said Zheng.CHINA MOVING TO THE TOPBasking in World Cup glory, Zheng urged her players to stay calm and work harder.""We only made it to the final in this tournament. It might come just by chance,"" said Zheng.""But if we are a genuinely top team like the USA, Australia, France and Spain, we need to prove ourselves in every competition.""A lack of experience is China´s biggest weakness, which often led to inconsistent play in the knockout stages, said Zheng.To change the situation, she stressed the importance of building up a more competitive professional league in China and scheduling more high-quality international friendlies for the national team.Zheng summarized the trend of women´s basketball as ""a more physical game with more vaguely defined positions, fiercer defense, more intensive body contact and better individual techniques.""""I believe we are approaching our goals on the right track through training,"" she said.TEAMWORK IS CHINA'S TRADITIONHaving served as an assistant coach of China´s national team for 12 years before taking charge as the head coach, Zheng is deeply impressed by the team´s tradition of teamwork.""Unity, cooperation, selfless dedication, and never giving up are the glorious traditions of China´s women´s basketball team,"" Zheng said.""Shao Ting and Sun Mengran have passed them on to Yang Liwei and Li Meng, and the latter are passing onto the next generation.""Zheng said that she also had good cooperation with her predecessors and learned a lot from them.""I had been analyzing opponents' strategies for the team before, so I am very familiar with both our players and our main opponents. What I can do is bring out the players' strength and make them more confident,"" she said.BALANCING PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL TEAMThe 2022-2023 WCBA league season is set to conclude in mid-March. Zheng confirmed that the national team will assemble at the end of March to begin preparations for this year´s two main events - the Asian Cup and the Asian Games.""We will play the Asian Cup in June, but some of the players who were in last year´s World Cup may not join the team because they have contracts with WNBA teams, so the mission will be tough for us,"" Zheng said.According to Zheng, four or five players, including center Han Xu and veteran Yang Liwei, have contacts with the WNBA. Zheng said she hopes that they can refine themselves in a more competitive league and return to perform better for the national team.Zheng revealed that the Asian Cup and the Asian Games are China´s short-term goal, while their long-term goal is the Paris Olympics in 2024.""We need to combine our preparations with the two goals,"" she said.""We may recruit more young players who can compete in international events. They are eager to play for the national team. We want to observe them and help them grow.""We hope to add one backup to every position. The national team´s roster will include 16 to 18 players this time.""Asked about their prospects at Paris 2024, Zheng said: ""We aim to match our World Cup performance in every major competition in the future. Hopefully we can achieve it.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219392.html,9,3,2023,"['zheng', 'team', 'china', 'cup', 'players', 'final', 'women', 'national', 'basketball', 'coach', 'asian', 'australia', 'play', 'head', 'regrets', 'years', 'games', 'high', 'paris', 'olympics']",0.41474471361971366,0.17011025779775782,9/3/2023
Chinese modernization sheds light on developing nations’ devt model - People's Daily Online,"Chinese modernization sheds light on developing nations’ devt model (Global Times) 08:57, March 09, 2023Path to modernization offers world an alternative to Western style featuring colonization, pillageDiscussion of Chinese modernization has culminated during this year´s ongoing two sessions, with foreign envoys and experts hailing that Chinese modernization has shed light on an alternative development path for nations. The Chinese path of realizing modernization, centering on independence, peace and the public good, provides the developing world an alternative to Western countries' road to modernization, which was achieved mainly via colonization and pillage, experts said.Moreover, those foreign envoys and experts see hope as China embarks on a new journey and a new stage for development, as the world´s second-biggest economy responded to global expectations and reiterated its pledge to work for global development and peace, which has injected much needed vitality to a global economy that is wrecked by COVID-19, unilateralism from certain Western countries and other factors.Each town has to make its way, but without doubt, the concept of ""Characteristics of the Chinese Path to Modernization"" helps many of us to clarify priorities and objectives. Modernization has to reach all social sectors, provide common prosperity, allow personal and collective development, and do so in harmony with humanity and the planet we live on, in a sustainable and peaceful manner. In this regard, I want to highlight the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, presented by China within the framework of the United Nations, Argentine Ambassador to China Sabino Vaca Narvaja told the Global Times.Former ambassador of Venezuela to Cuba Adan Chavez told media that his country needs to learn from China about how to achieve great victories like poverty alleviation, one of the greatest achievements China has made.Chinese modernization has spurred discussions at home and abroad since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in October 2022. During this year´s two sessions, the Chinese modernization blueprint will be fleshed out with specific targets to strive for. As this year marks the first year of this new journey, the new measures that will be unveiled at the two sessions not only matter to China, but to other countries as well.According to this year´s Government Work Report, China will make solid progress in advancing Chinese modernization. ""We should, with a focus on key industrial chains in the manufacturing sector, pool quality resources and make concerted efforts to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields,"" it said.In the eyes of Martin Jacques, a visiting professor at the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University and a senior fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, instead of advocating the jungle law of nation-states, where the writ of the strongest reigns supreme, ""China propounds new forms of global collaboration,"" as exemplified by the Belt and Road Initiative and the idea of a community with a shared future for mankind, as the way of the future.Achieving modernization in a country with a population of more than 1.4 billion will be an unprecedented feat in human history, and Chinese modernization offers solutions to many challenges facing human development, and dispels the myth that modernization is Westernization, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gangsaid during a press conference on Tuesday on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress.Qin detailed five features of Chinese modernization, which are independence, putting people first, peaceful development, openness and inclusiveness and working hard in unity.In contrast with Western-style modernization, which is driven by profits and capitalism, and as a result benefits only a small group of people, Chinese modernization is to let everyone usher in such process, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.Chinese modernization has broken a myth created by Western countries that wealth can only be created via colonization and pillage, said Li, noting that the Chinese path proves that modernization can be achieved via a peaceful model, and offers an alternative for other developing countries.Western modernization vs Chinese modernization. Graphic: GTEyeing China´s developmentThis year´s two sessions, which will lay out the roadmap for implementing the plans of the 20th National Congress of the CPC and the first since China triumphed over COVID-19, has attracted the world´s attention. People from many countries say China´s development is of great importance to the world and its development experience is worth learning. They believe this year´s two sessions herald China´s entry to a new development stage that will inject the world with much needed vitality for a global recovery.I attended the opening ceremonies of this year´s two sessions - the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC). This is my first time attending the meetings of such important and top-level legislature and advisory bodies of China respectively. They are decisive for the future political development of China, Nepali Ambassador to China Bishnu Pukar Shrestha told the Global Times.The ongoing sessions hold special importance to the Chinese and the world as they are being held for the first time after China´s decisive victory over COVID-19. Therefore, all eyes are now on the two sessions, with many expecting that the sessions will come up with good news for the pandemic and wars-stricken world, Musundali Bhuiyan, a Bangladeshi journalist told the Global Times.As a committed and responsible global partner, China has also responded to global expectations and reiterated its pledge to work for global development and peace. In the Government Work Report presented to the sessions, China announced its readiness to work with the international community to put into action the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative and promote the shared values of humanity, said Bhuiyan.More importantly, Bhuiyan said, the report mentioned that China will remain firm in pursuing a strategy of opening up for mutual benefits, making the world more optimistic about a better future. Bangladesh is not an exception in this case. As a strategic partner of China, Bangladesh can also benefit from the decisions to be taken in the sessions.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219150.html,9,3,2023,"['china', 'modernization', 'global', 'development', 'sessions', 'western', 'countries', 'times', 'path', 'work', 'initiative', 'national', 'alternative', 'foreign', 'congress', 'future', 'developing', 'nations', 'offers', 'colonization']",0.27854101821043975,0.11206039139923438,9/3/2023

China once again urges U.S. to immediately stop political manipulation on COVID origins-tracing: FM spokesperson - People's Daily Online,"China once again urges U.S. to immediately stop political manipulation on COVID origins-tracing: FM spokesperson (Xinhua) 08:17, March 10, 2023BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China once again urged the U.S. side to immediately stop political manipulation on COVID origins-tracing, voluntarily share the data of suspected early cases in the United States with the WHO, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday.Mao´s remarks came after the U.S. Senate passed the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023 a few days ago, which says that the COVID-19 pandemic may have originated in China. Director of the U.S. National Intelligence Avril Haines on Wednesday noted that there is not a consensus among the U.S. intelligence community on whether or not the outbreak is a result of a lab leak or natural exposure to an infected animal. Besides, Polish virologist Agnieszka Szuster-Ciesielska recently said in an interview that the COVID ""lab leak"" theory rehashed by the U.S. Department of Energy and FBI is sensation-seeking and has no factual or scientific basis.For some time now, the United States has been politicizing, weaponizing and instrumentalizing COVID origins-tracing for many months, Mao said, adding it has let a matter of science be dominated by lawmakers and the intelligence community and spread myths such as the ""lab leak"" theory without any evidence to discredit and attack China.""This has seriously poisoned the atmosphere for science-based global origins-tracing and been perceived by people in the rest of the world,"" she said.Noting China´s position on the origins-tracing is consistent, Mao said China has supported and participated in global science-based origins-tracing since day one.""In the meantime, we have been firmly opposed to all forms of political manipulation on this issue,"" Mao said, adding the political manipulation by the United States is the main stumbling block to the science-based research on COVID origins.Mao said the United States has been pointing fingers at WHO´s origins-tracing process, politically punishing scientists with conscience and attacking countries with lies that make no scientific sense.Pointing out that the United States has done nothing responsible on origins-tracing, Mao said it has never invited WHO expert groups to the United States for joint research or shared any early data on COVID origins and it has turned a deaf ear to the world´s concerns about U.S. bio-military bases at Fort Detrick and around the world.Politicizing origins-tracing would only hamper science-based cooperation on the issue, disrupt solidarity against the virus, and undermine global health governance mechanisms, Mao said.""We once again urge the U.S. side to immediately stop political manipulation on this issue, respond to the world´s legitimate concerns, voluntarily share the data of suspected early cases in the United States with the WHO, disclose information about its bio-labs at Fort Detrick and around the world, and give the rest of the world the truth it deserves,"" she added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219633.html,10,3,2023,"['origins', 'tracing', 'covid', 'mao', 'united', 'states', 'china', 'political', 'manipulation', 'science', 'based', 'immediately', 'stop', 'data', 'early', 'intelligence', 'lab', 'leak', 'global', 'issue']",0.26299999999999996,0.026333333333333334,10/3/2023
Sanctions against Sudan outdated: Chinese envoy - People's Daily Online,"Sanctions against Sudan outdated: Chinese envoy (Xinhua) 16:45, March 09, 2023UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions by the United Nations Security Council against Sudan have been proved outdated and should be lifted, a Chinese envoy said on Wednesday.The 15-member Security Council Wednesday decided, with a vote of 13 in favor and two abstentions (China and Russia), to extend through March 12, 2024, the mandate of the Panel of Experts charged with assisting its Sudan sanctions committee.Adopting resolution 2676 (2023), the council also expressed its intention to review the sanctions in light of progress achieved by the government of Sudan on several key benchmarks. The United States is the penholder of the draft resolution.In an explanation of the vote, Dai Bing, charge d'affaires of China´s permanent mission to the United Nations, said that the Security Council sanctions on Darfur in Sudan, which began in 2004, are aimed at ending the armed conflict in Darfur and helping Sudan return to peace and stability.He noted that the Sudanese transitional government and the armed opposition signed the Juba Peace Agreement in 2020, and the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) completed its mandate and withdrew from Darfur at the end of the same year.""Those positive developments pointed to a fundamental shift for the better in the situation in Darfur, and the fact that the Security Council sanctions against Sudan are outdated and should be lifted in light of the improved circumstances on the ground,"" Dai said.He pointed out that keeping those sanctions in place is not only untenable in the context of the country´s political and security realities, but also limits the government´s security capacity, negatively impacting its ability to maintain stability in Darfur and protect civilians and combat crimes there.The draft resolution on Wednesday endorses two benchmarks for the adjustment of sanctions, which Dai said appears to be a roadmap for lifting sanctions, ""but in practice it is neither realistic nor feasible.""China and some members initially proposed discussing benchmarks aimed at creating the conditions for lifting sanctions as soon as possible.""But discussions in the Security Council over the past two years led us to believe that the members concerned have no intention of lifting the sanctions and instead want to make them permanent by setting benchmarks that can never be met,"" Dai said.""The draft resolution introduced by the penholder does not address our concerns in that regard,"" he added.The envoy also reiterated China´s call for a comprehensive assessment of the existing Security Council sanctions regime and the formulation of clear and feasible exit criteria.Sanctions are an important tool entrusted to the Security Council by the UN Charter, originally intended to create conditions for the political settlement of relevant issues, he said.But in practice, sanctions have increasingly become a substitute for diplomatic efforts and even a means of political pressurization for some countries, said Dai, noting that some individual member has abused its penholdership to impose its national position on the Security Council.""The Security Council should conduct periodic reviews of relevant sanctions, and once the criteria are met, sanctions should be adjusted or lifted timely,"" he said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219581.html,9,3,2023,"['sanctions', 'security', 'council', 'sudan', 'darfur', 'dai', 'united', 'china', 'resolution', 'benchmarks', 'outdated', 'envoy', 'nations', 'lifted', 'wednesday', 'government', 'draft', 'political', 'lifting', 'member']",0.4847081930415264,0.05996071829405162,9/3/2023

In 2015, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission appointed by the Canadian government concluded that children were physically and sexually abused and died in the schools in numbers that may never be fully known.Tzay said the Commission´s Calls to Action should be fully implemented. ""The full resolution of Indian Residential School claims is necessary to achieve true reconciliation, including for Catholic church-run institutions and residential schools established by provinces,"" the UN expert said.Flag marks are seen at the site of unmarked graves near a former indigenous residential school in Saskatchewan, Canada, on June 27, 2021. (Photo by Amru Salahuddien/Xinhua)""Canada has made progress towards the promotion and protection of the rights of Indigenous Peoples since the visits of my predecessors,"" he said, while pointing to many existing challenges that remain unaddressed.""The negative legacies of residential schools are reflected in the child welfare system today. Despite comprising 7.7% of the Canadian population, over 53% of children in care are indigenous, up to 90% in some provinces,"" he said.Tzay said intergenerational trauma caused by residential schools and structural racial discrimination has led to a number of present-day human rights violations and abuses, including the current crisis concerning missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. It is estimated that Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women in Canada.""The number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to increase,"" the expert said. The special rapporteur noted that most of the 231 Calls for Justice of the National Inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) and gender diverse people still remain to be implemented. He called on the Canadian government to prevent and combat such violence as a matter of priority, by addressing the root causes of the MMIWG ""epidemic"", including systemic racism and discrimination against Indigenous women and girls.The special rapporteur also expressed concern that Indigenous Peoples have continued to be overrepresented in the criminal justice system.""The situation of Indigenous women and gender diverse peoples is even more devastating as they represent half of the federal prison population,"" Tzay said. ""Indigenous Peoples are often victims of racial profiling, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, and disproportionate use of force by law enforcement personnel.""People visit a memorial at the site of the former St. Paul Indian Residential School in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on Aug. 10, 2021.

""International human rights law entails a duty on the part of the State not only to refrain from violating human rights, but to exercise due diligence to prevent and protect individuals from abuse committed by non-State actors, such as business enterprises, including outside their territories,"" he said.The special rapporteur noted that Canada has embarked on an important journey towards reconciliation that must dismantle structural and systemic racism against Indigenous Peoples and respect Indigenous Peoples' right to self-determination, lands, territories, and resources.""Human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent, and all Indigenous Peoples should have equal rights and opportunities,"" the special rapporteur said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220592.html,11,3,2023,"['indigenous', 'canada', 'rights', 'peoples', 'residential', 'schools', 'women', 'expert', 'reconciliation', 'tzay', 'special', 'rapporteur', 'human', 'including', 'girls', 'achieve', 'school', 'government', 'missing', 'murdered']",0.40063244047619073,0.0806547619047619,11/3/2023

(People´s Daily Online/Cheng Cong)The past five years since the 19th National Congress of the CPC have been truly momentous and remarkable, and the year 2022 was of great importance in the history of the CPC.China has won the critical battle against poverty as scheduled, finished building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and embarked on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects.Last year, China achieved stable and orderly policy adjustment and shifting of focus in COVID-19 control in a short period of time, maintained the world´s lowest fatality rate in the pandemic and declared a major and decisive victory in COVID-19 response.Besides, the country maintained stable commodity price in general while global inflation reached a 40-year high. Its GDP grew by 3 percent, which was considerably high among major economies in the world.Xi stressed that the CPC Central Committee always unswervingly consolidates and develops the public sector, and unswervingly encourages, supports and guides the development of the non-public sector.He also said the CPC Central Committee always believes that private enterprises and entrepreneurs ""belong to our own family.""Efforts should be made to put in place a cordial and clean relationship between government and business, Xi said.Chips are manufactured in a dust-free workshop of a semiconductor company in Suqian, east China´s Jiangsu province, Feb. 28, 2023.

The investment of private capital should be energized, and more private capital should be encouraged and attracted into major state projects and key industrial and supply chain projects, he noted.Noting that Chinese modernization is the modernization of common prosperity for all, Xi said both state-owned and private enterprises must shoulder the social responsibility of promoting common prosperity.Xi called on private enterprises to ensure that all employees share their development outcomes.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219331.html,9,3,2023,"['china', 'private', 'xi', 'development', 'cpc', 'national', 'high', 'central', 'committee', 'province', 'enterprises', 'country', 'made', 'commerce', 'cppcc', 'company', 'building', 'major', 'sector', 'quality']",0.36793686868686865,0.07239772727272728,9/3/2023

Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks (Xinhua) 12:21, March 11, 2023VIENNA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called for advancing open, transparent, inclusive and sustainable intergovernmental discussion at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address the proliferation risks posed by the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation.Li Song, China´s permanent representative to the IAEA, said at a meeting of the agency´s Board of Governors that the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration poses serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation regime, stimulates arms race, and threatens the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.In September 2021, the United States, Britain and Australia announced the AUKUS deal, under which Washington and London will assist Canberra in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. China and many other countries have repeatedly expressed concerns over the transfer of high purity uranium involved in the pact.The essence of the AUKUS cooperation is the transfer of tons of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from the United States and Britain, both nuclear-weapon states and signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to Australia, a non-nuclear-weapon state, Li said.He added such a ""textbook case"" of nuclear proliferation violates NPT´s objectives and principles, and undermines the IAEA´s existing safeguard system and the international non-proliferation regime.He urged the AUKUS countries to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset, fulfill their international obligations and contribute more to regional peace and stability.It is up to all IAEA member states to seek proper solutions through intergovernmental discussions regarding whether and how to conduct safeguards on the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration, as the matter concerns the interests of all the member states and the integrity and effectiveness of the NPT, he said.Stressing that China respects the right of all other member states to express their views, Li said that China firmly opposes any country trying to impose its own views on others.""The U.S., the UK and Australia, while preaching the so-called 'highest non-proliferation standards,' are labeling normal intergovernmental discussions as 'politicized' and rejecting multilateral discussions. Is this what they call the 'rules-based international order?'"" he said.Noting it is essential to keep the intergovernmental discussion going at the IAEA as the AUKUS countries are about to announce concrete plans for their nuclear submarine cooperation, Li said that only true multilateralism can effectively safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation regime.Li called on the IAEA member states to actively participate in the intergovernmental discussion process to help safeguard the global non-proliferation regime.He said he believes IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and the agency´s secretariat will play their due roles in the process and assist the member states in maintaining and advancing the process.He also urged the AUKUS countries not to settle on relevant safeguards arrangements with the IAEA secretariat or start nuclear submarine cooperation before a consensus is reached among the agency´s member states.The AUKUS countries should respond to the international community´s concerns with concrete actions, fulfill their non-proliferation obligations, and maintain candid and transparent communication with other member states on the basis of equality and mutual respect, he added.Representatives from Russia and other developing countries spoke in support of China´s position on the AUKUS issue at the IAEA board meeting. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220521.html,11,3,2023,"['aukus', 'proliferation', 'nuclear', 'states', 'iaea', 'international', 'member', 'countries', 'intergovernmental', 'submarine', 'li', 'china', 'discussion', 'agency', 'cooperation', 'regime', 'risks', 'called', 'australia', 'concerns']",0.4014713064713065,0.07343711843711843,11/3/2023

[Photo/Xinhua]Nearly 40 million entries and exits to and from the Chinese mainland were made in the past two months since China downgraded its COVID-19 management from Class A to Class B on Jan 8, as a number of countries are expected to relax their epidemic restrictions for travelers from China.The National Immigration Administration said on Wednesday that the numbers of people and vehicles entering and leaving the mainland increased significantly since the implementation of the optimized COVID-19 response measures.As of Tuesday, immigration authorities across the country had handled 39.72 million entry and exit trips, up 112.4 percent year-on-year, and the number of inbound and outbound vehicles, boats, planes and trains totaled nearly 2.5 million, up 59.3 percent year-on-year.The authorities issued about 3.36 million passports to Chinese citizens in the past two months, more than 13 times the number issued in the preceding two-month period before the optimized COVID-19 measures took effect. In addition, 12.67 million certificates were issued for travel to and from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, an increase of 837.7 percent, and 122,000 visas and residence permits were issued to foreigners, up 33.1 percent.Lin Yongsheng, a spokesman for the administration, said that since the implementation of the optimized measures, the entry-exit flow of people and applications for entry-exit documents have risen sharply, driven by the steady increase in international passenger flights and the resumption of personnel exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong as well as Macao.Immigration authorities will continue to improve the measures to meet the increased entry-exit needs and promote exchanges between Chinese and foreign personnel, Lin said.Meanwhile, United States media reports said that Washington is planning to ease COVID-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China ""as early as Friday"". Two months ago, it introduced targeted COVID-19 testing policies for passengers aged 2 and older from China, requiring them to offer a negative nucleic acid test result within two days before their flight.In response to the reported US act to ease the restrictions, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that China always believes that the epidemic control measures adopted by every country should be scientific and appropriate.""We hope relevant countries will work with China to provide more convenience for personnel exchanges between China and other countries,"" Mao said.Meanwhile, South Korea said on Wednesday it will lift COVID-19 control restrictions for travelers from China starting on Saturday, and people who want to enter South Korea from China will not need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours before departure.On March 1, South Korea lifted its policy requiring travelers from China to undergo nucleic acid testing after landing in the country and requiring all fights from China to land at the country´s Incheon International Airport.Dai Bin, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference and president of the China Tourism Academy, said on the sidelines of the ongoing two sessions that based on the current development of the tourism market and various factors, including policy, supply and tourists' assessment of destinations, it is expected that the inbound and outbound tourism market will recover this year to within 30 to 40 percent of its 2019 level.The factors affecting the recovery of the inbound and outbound tourism market are much more complex than those in the domestic tourism market, so it will be slower than the recovery of domestic tourism, Dai said.""I have full confidence in 2023, and I think as long as tourists, tourism operators, government regulators and industry promotion departments can think together and work together, we will soon return to our ideal goal,"" he said.With the intensive release of favorable inbound and outbound tourism policies, the trend for tourism recovery has gradually emerged.

Major events can promote global prosperity - People's Daily Online,"Major events can promote global prosperityBy Zhang Yunbi (China Daily) 08:48, March 08, 2023[Photo/Xinhua]Experts say forums on BRI and other issues will promote stable and safe interaction. A series of planned major events high on the schedule of China´s diplomacy at home — especially one to celebrate the Belt and Road Initiative´s 10th anniversary — will further convince the world of the country´s sincerity and policy consistency in terms of opening-up to the outside world and bolstering global prosperity, veteran officials and scholars told China Daily.These policy insiders are attending the annual two sessions in Beijing as members of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the country´s top political advisory body.In recent months, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have confirmed that China will work with various parties to host a major diplomatic event this year — the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.They said China is willing to take the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative as an opportunity to look back and build on the BRI´s achievements, draw up a blueprint and further advance its high-quality development with the attendees.President Xi Jinping first proposed the two most important components of the Belt and Road Initiative — the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road — in 2013.The first and second Belt and Road Forums for International Cooperation were held in Beijing in 2017 and 2019, respectively, bringing together dozens of foreign heads of state, government leaders and chiefs of key international organizations, such as the United Nations.Some countries have already responded positively to news of this year´s Belt and Road forum.During a meeting last month, Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron, told Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, that France is willing to earnestly participate in the forum.China has already signed more than 200 cooperation documents with 151 countries and 32 international organizations to build the BRI, doubled its trade in goods and increased its direct investment in countries along the initiative´s routes by 80 percent.ZHANG YUJUN/FOR CHINA DAILYPoverty alleviationAccording to a 2019 World Bank report, ""BRI transportation projects could help lift 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty"" (those earning less than $1.90 a day), and ""32 million people from moderate poverty"" (less than $3.20 a day).Gu Xueming, president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing and a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, said, ""The Belt and Road Initiative originated in China, but the opportunities and results it has brought belong to the whole world.""He added that looking back on the past 10 years, BRI construction has maintained great vitality, and the initiative has responded to the needs of the times via China´s role and contribution.Gu cited the example of a Chinese company that invested in a pharmaceutical factory in the West African country of Mali under the China-Africa Public Health Plan. With the start of mass production at the factory, Mali not only ended its history of reliance on imported drugs but also significantly reduced the price of medication in its home market. At the same time, the factory gave rise to the development of upstream and downstream industries, Gu said.""When we are looking ahead, the prospects are bright and the tasks are mounting. This requires substantial efforts in BRI construction, more Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions, and a high level of China´s opening-up in order to build a community with a shared future and improve global governance,"" he added.Hu Sishe, former vice-president of the Chinese People´s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, said it is necessary to further improve person-to-person contacts between China and countries along BRI routes.He called for full play to be given to the role of existing friendships between Chinese and foreign sister cities, along with more sister city exchanges and cooperation under the context of the BRI to build a solid foundation for exchanges at the local level between China and participating countries.""I recommend piloting more dialogue and exchanges with historic and cultural cities along BRI routes, in particular dialogue and exchanges with those in Europe and in West Asian and North African countries, thus boosting the resonance and common language with countries along the routes,"" he said.Prospering togetherWhen he met with a South Korean entrepreneur in Beijing last month, Liu Jinsong, director of the Foreign Ministry´s Department of Asian Affairs, said that in addition to the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, China will host the annual Boao Forum for Asia and the China-ASEAN Expo this year.""These major events will provide important platforms for China to deepen exchanges and cooperation with other countries"", and ""businesses from Asian countries are enjoying multiple enabling factors in their cooperation with China"", Liu was quoted as saying in a news release on the Foreign Ministry´s website.Chinese officials and scholars said opening to the outside world is a win-win situation for both China and its foreign partners, and by China spreading its arms and reach to the world, both sides enjoy many mutual benefits.From 2001 to 2021, the first 20 years after China´s accession to the World Trade Organization, the country´s total economic output rose from sixth largest in the world to second largest, and it has become a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, according to the Ministry of Commerce. Between 2013 and 2021, China´s annual contribution to global economic growth averaged 38.6 percent, larger than the combined contribution of the Group of Seven countries.Although the global economy has continued to suffer from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the past year, major international exhibitions such as the Canton Fair and the China International Import Expo were held as scheduled, providing highlights amid the global economic downturn, experts said.Yang Guangbin, a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and dean of the School of International Relations at the Renmin University of China, said, ""Instead of taking a winner-takes-all approach, China is sincerely committed to building the Belt and Road together in order to promote the common development of countries along the routes.""China has proved its ability by co-founding the buildup of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the community with a shared future for humanity it advocates is also an approach to adjusting the established world order that features some inequalities. China has become an important player in perfecting the established order.""Observers have noted that the international situation has become increasingly complex at a time when global peace and development are facing serious challenges, including the spillover effect of the lingering Ukraine crisis and US coercion and verbal attacks on China.Zhao Mei, a senior research fellow with the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, said, ""The external environment for China´s economic development is facing dire challenges, and world peace and development are undergoing the most severe tests since the end of the Cold War.""She pointed out that ""the changes in China-US relations are the most prominent part of the changing global landscape not seen in a century. At present, China-US ties are faced with serious challenges, and the international community also has many misunderstandings about China´s development and China´s path for development.""The National Security Strategy Report released by the Biden administration last year claimed that China ""harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit"", Zhao noted.""There´s still a long way to go in telling the Chinese story to the world in an effective manner,"" she said.Path to modernizationIn October, the report to the CPC´s 20th National Congress made it clear that the Chinese path to modernization is one that ""follows the path of peaceful development"".Scholars said this viewpoint is conducive to convincing the international community of China´s consistent dedication to global stability and prosperity.China is the only country in the world that has enshrined its adherence to the path of peaceful development in its constitution, and it is the only one of the ""five nuclear-weapon states"" that has pledged not to be the first to use such weapons.China has never taken the initiative to provoke conflict or war, let alone resort to force or the threat of force, Chinese diplomats said in recent public speeches, adding that the country´s development has always represented a growing force for peace in the world.Jia Qingguo, a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and director of the Institute for Global Cooperation and Understanding at Peking University, said that this method of achieving modernization via the path of peaceful development is ""based on history and reality"" and it contributes Chinese wisdom to the solution of human problems. It rebuts the Clash of Civilizations theory and the stereotypical belief that ""a powerful nation will surely become a hegemony"", Jia said.""More than 70 years after the founding of the People´s Republic of China, the CPC and the Chinese people, who have endured major sufferings, know well the rarity of peace and the value of development, and they take it as their lofty duty to promote world peace and development,"" he said.He added that in the face of the challenge of a growing deficit in global peace, development, security and governance, President Xi proposed the Global Development Initiative in 2021 and the Global Security Initiative last year.These ""provide a Chinese solution for the common development and progress of all countries in the world"", Jia said.Improving world governanceExperts said China´s participation in the reform and strengthening of the global governance system and its commitment to genuine multilateralism — as manifested by the fresh initiatives and road maps for coordinated global efforts — are helping to advance global governance and making it more fair, just and reasonable.""The established global governance model is currently challenged and seems unsustainable, and a new global governance model needs to be explored in a coordinated approach,"" said Liu Xianzhong, a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and director of the Department of Russian History and Culture at the Institute of Russian, East European and Central Asian Studies with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.""Countries should resort to reconciliation and resolve global governance issues in the spirit of building a community with a shared future. Only when the world is a success can China be successful. A better China also contributes to a better world.""Liu said China´s economy is deeply integrated with the global economy, having a high degree of interconnectivity and interdependence in industries with many countries around the world.""China´s unswerving pursuit of a mutually beneficial, win-win opening-up strategy will enable the country to benefit from driving forces worldwide for its development, and the pursuit also allows China´s development to better benefit the world,"" he said.In the field of politics and security, Liu stressed that countries should not engage in cliques and group confrontation, and they should mobilize global resources to address global challenges and promote greater global development.""The success of one country does not necessarily mean the failure of another. Flexing military muscle frequently is a hegemonic approach that can only lift stones and hit one´s own feet,"" he said. ""No country can seek its own absolute security on its own. No country can achieve its own security without the security of the world.""Yang, from the Renmin University of China, noted that the Chinese path to modernization, ""bearing the genes of Chinese civilization, has brought new values and elements to the new international order"".He noted that the socialist system with Chinese characteristics has learned from some of the successful economic management experiences of developed countries, and it has stood out in globalization.""The Chinese experience provides a Chinese solution and Chinese inspiration for developing countries that want to develop while maintaining their independence,"" he said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218462.html,8,3,2023,"['china', 'global', 'development', 'countries', 'international', 'road', 'belt', 'initiative', 'country', 'bri', 'national', 'cooperation', 'committee', 'foreign', 'major', 'economic', 'member', 'governance', 'path', 'security']",0.31130276340642205,0.1041739036708549,8/3/2023
Black Americans view capitalism more negatively than positively: Pew - People's Daily Online,"Black Americans view capitalism more negatively than positively: Pew (Xinhua) 10:24, March 10, 2023People walk on the frozen Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C., the United States, on Dec. 25, 2022. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)Today, most Black adults say the U.S. economic system does not treat Black people fairly.NEW YORK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Black Americans have long had significantly lower wages and household wealth than White Americans, and the roots of these inequities trace back to the central role slave labor once played in the nation´s economic system and the subsequent segregation and discrimination in labor markets, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys.In an August 2022 survey, 54 percent of Black adults said they had a very or somewhat negative impression of capitalism, up from 40 percent in May 2019.

"China's whole-process people's democracy vibrant, effective - People's Daily Online","China´s whole-process people´s democracy vibrant, effective (Xinhua) 09:52, March 10, 2023BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- As an American who grew up in the United States and has lived in China for a few decades, I have found a keyword that many people talk about is ""democracy."" Many in the United States think that China is not democratic. In my opinion, seeing is believing. The democracy I've seen in China is vibrant and very effective.Every year at this time, when spring flowers bloom, the ""two sessions"" -- China´s important annual political gatherings -- are held in Beijing, and this year was no exception.In Western countries such as the United States, where democracy and elections are essentially equated, people elect someone and hope for the best. In China, democracy is more than elections. The ""two sessions"" have been a window to showcase the strength and vitality of China´s democracy. Last year before the ""two sessions,"" my colleagues and I had the opportunity to visit a Shanghai community, which gave me a sense of how China´s whole-process people´s democracy works on a daily basis.In Shanghai´s Hongqiao subdistrict, we interviewed Noyan Rona, a Turkish banker and an enthusiastic volunteer. Rona told us that, when approached about a draft revision to the individual income tax law in 2018, he suggested adding the word ""accumulated"" before the individual tax residency threshold of 183 days in a tax year to make the rule more explicit.Rona recalled this story from several years ago with renewed excitement. His suggestion was adopted and written into law, which would influence a lot of foreigners living in China, he proudly told us.I was very curious to know that, for residents like Rona who are keen to offer opinions, in what ways can they have their opinions heard by lawmakers? At a civic center in Hongqiao, we saw a type of red mailbox designed to collect letters of opinion from residents.In fact, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People´s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee set up a community-level contact station at the civic center. The red mailboxes are part of their facility. Draft laws are sent down here so that ordinary citizens can discuss them and have their opinions heard. In other words, the voices of grassroots people will reach the highest legislative body.Since the establishment of the contact station in 2015, 78 draft laws, including the Foreign Investment Law, have been discussed here by residents in Hongqiao and 163 pieces of advice incorporated, including Rona´s suggestion about individual income tax law.I learned from this year´s ""two sessions"" that similar community-level contact stations have been set up across the nation, becoming the ""through train"" for the grassroots voices to reach the national legislature. What I didn't know was that as a foreigner living in China, I also have such rights.Of course, the channels themselves do not guarantee full participation. There is an important role to play for representatives of public opinion at the grassroots. They are the 2.77 million deputies to people´s congresses at all levels nationwide.Deputies would visit organizations and individuals that can vote, hear and collect public opinions, and conduct research for the proposals and suggestions they submit. They would also participate in research trips, seminars, dialogues, and open-day events to talk about issues of public concern. In addition, they would receive training from time to time to enhance their ability to perform their duties.The practice in Hongqiao is very successful. In November 2019, President Xi Jinping visited the civic center while a consultation meeting on a draft law was underway. Xi talked to both the Chinese and foreign residents attending the meeting, and for the first time made the remark that ""People´s democracy is a type of whole-process democracy.""Compared with legislators in the West who make politics their career and usually have a staff and campaign team, NPC deputies come from all walks of life and all 56 ethnic groups in China. Most of them are part-timers, who work and live among their people and therefore understand their needs best.In an interview with Xinhua, Rick Dunham, a U.S. visiting professor at Tsinghua University, pointed out that in the United States, there are more lawyers, doctors, and top managers involved in politics. In China, one finds more grassroots representation including blue-collar workers, farmers and takeaway riders. I would agree with his conclusion that China´s NPC deputies are more representative than U.S. lawmakers.From protecting workers' rights in the food-delivery and car-hailing industries to alleviating the pressure of excessive schoolwork and off-campus tutoring; from solving the financing difficulties of SMEs to protecting the ecology of the Yellow River... Deputies and political advisors collect and sort out the opinions of ordinary people, which often form the basis of their proposals and suggestions. Some of these ideas will be incorporated into relevant laws, regulations, systems, policies, decisions and arrangements.Over the past five years, as I was told, some 18,000 pieces of advice from national lawmakers and political advisors have been adopted by relevant departments of the Chinese central government and over 7,800 policy measures have subsequently been introduced. As a result, many problems have been addressed related to the country´s reform and development and the people´s most urgent needs.In a nutshell, China´s democracy is a whole process that can involve all people. To let the people discuss the affairs of their own and to make sure that the people are in charge are the essence of the ""whole-process people´s democracy.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219808.html,10,3,2023,"['china', 'democracy', 'process', 'rona', 'law', 'opinions', 'deputies', 'united', 'states', 'sessions', 'hongqiao', 'draft', 'tax', 'residents', 'grassroots', 'political', 'community', 'individual', 'make', 'lawmakers']",0.40379499217527387,0.1758329776639636,10/3/2023
How is China's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind viewed? - People's Daily Online,"How is China´s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind viewed? (Xinhua) 09:33, March 09, 2023BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- About 10 years ago, while expounding on China´s views on international affairs at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for forging a community with a shared future for mankind, where each person has a stake in the other.Since then, the concept has evolved into a vision with global significance, and been recognized by more and more countries and international organizations.China will promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, promote greater democracy in international relations, and make global governance more just and equitable, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said Tuesday at a press conference held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People´s Congress.China will offer more, better Chinese insight and solutions to help meet humanity´s common challenges, he added.AN INSPIRING IDEAAs Xi once elaborated, ""to build a community with a shared future for mankind is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and levels of development coming together for shared interests, shared rights and shared responsibilities in global affairs, and creating the greatest synergy for building a better world.""There is a ""very fundamental difference"" between Xi´s vision of a shared future, which emphasizes understanding and shared institution-building, and the prevailing U.S. idea of building a future through competition, Jack Midgley, principal of the global consultancy Midgley &Company, told media.""When Xi says shared future, that´s a future that includes everybody and where everyone´s interests have to be taken into account. We have to find a way to build a shared future together, or there won't be a future at all,"" said Midgley, who is also an adjunct associate professor on security studies at Georgetown University.In September last year, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda published his new book Collected Works of Yasuo Fukuda: Pursuing World Peace, the keyword of which, Fukuda told Xinhua, is a community with a shared future for mankind.Fukuda said he fully agrees with China´s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, arguing that if one country is doing well only by itself when its neighbors are not, the imbalance will lead to conflicts that will then backfire on itself.For B. R. Deepak, chairperson of the Center of Chinese and Southeast Asian Studies at the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University, the vision largely reflects the core values of China´s traditional culture such as harmony and equality.It could be considered as an outcome of China´s dialogue and mutual learning with other civilizations in the course of history, he said.WALK THE TALKChina has not only been advocating a community with a shared future for mankind, but also put it into practice. The burgeoning Belt and Road cooperation shows how China translates its words into deeds, and how the concept helps change the world.Since its operation in December 2021, the China-Laos Railway, a flagship Belt and Road cooperation project, has brought great benefits to the Lao people and opened up a new path for Laos' development and prosperity.""Laos and China joined hands to build the railway, develop and deepen our friendship, and also developed our economy in Laos, especially cargo transportation,"" said Pansay Yiayengva, a conductor at Vientiane Station of the railway.Sharing her working experience, she mentioned that her career has changed her life and made her a mature and responsible person. ""I am very satisfied and proud to work here.""In addition to providing jobs for local residents, the construction and operation of the China-Laos Railway has also increased the fiscal and tax revenue of the Lao government.Meanwhile, thanks to railway transportation, such sectors as mining, agriculture, tourism, logistics, commerce, hotels and real estate in Laos have bloomed.Over the past decade, the Belt and Road has galvanized nearly 1 trillion U.S. dollars of investment, established more than 3,000 cooperation projects, created 420,000 local jobs, and helped lift almost 40 million people out of poverty, said the Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday.Belt and Road projects have demonstrated how effective cooperation can transform the concept of ""building a community with a shared future for mankind"" into practical reality, said Almas Chukin, a prominent Kazakh economist.When it comes to safeguarding global peace, China has also upheld the spirit of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Committed to promoting a new type of international relations, China has been deepening and expanding global partnerships based on equality, openness, and cooperation.China is a major troop contributor and the second-largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, and has set up an 8,000-strong peacekeeping standby force.Last year, China proposed the Global Security Initiative, which advocates a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, follows the philosophy that humanity is an indivisible security community, and aims to create a new path to security that features dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliance and win-win over zero-sum.WAY OUT OF THE MIREWith the world beset with such grave challenges as a sluggish economic recovery, surging isolationism, rising hegemonism and flare-ups of geopolitical conflicts, the international community is eagerly exploring the way forward.""Humanity should overcome difficulties in solidarity and pursue common development in harmony,"" Xi offered China´s solution to the problems at a conference marking the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People´s Republic of China in the United Nations.Bearing in mind that ""no person or country can thrive in isolation,"" China has been championing an open economy and promoting a more balanced, inclusive and sustainable growth, thus enabling the world to share in its development opportunities. It has rolled out such cooperation platforms as the China International Import Expo (CIIE) and put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI).At the fifth edition of the CIIE, tentative deals worth a total of 73.52 billion dollars were reached for one-year purchases of goods and services. Drawing a blueprint for a more inclusive development of the world, the GDI has won international recognition. More than 100 countries and a number of international organizations, including the United Nations, have committed support to the GDI, and close to 70 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI.Meanwhile, China has delivered global public goods where needed. To narrow the ""immunization gap"" exposed in the pandemic, China and other BRICS countries inaugurated a vaccine research and development center to make vaccines accessible and affordable for developing countries.In particular, China actively responds to the calls and concerns of the poverty-stricken countries which bear the brunt in the aftershock of the global pandemic and economic downturn. For example, China is helping many African countries, such as Mozambique, develop modern agriculture with the help of the China-developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and unmanned equipment.Building a sense of a shared future is important for the world to avoid fragmentation and address challenges, former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said.The Belt and Road is an important path toward materializing this vision, Hatoyama said, adding that the initiative will help promote regional economic development and exchanges between countries, thereby preventing disputes effectively.""The global future of the human species ... is an issue which commands the attention of people everywhere in the world. There are so many things that need to be done. So China can take the lead on that,"" Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219225.html,9,3,2023,"['china', 'shared', 'future', 'community', 'global', 'building', 'mankind', 'international', 'countries', 'development', 'vision', 'cooperation', 'laos', 'xi', 'security', 'belt', 'road', 'railway', 'fukuda', 'gdi']",0.2972325293753865,0.11375876108018963,9/3/2023
"NPC deputies, national political advisors call to better protect women’s rights - People's Daily Online","NPC deputies, national political advisors call to better protect women’s rights (Global Times) 09:05, March 09, 2023On International Women´s Day, the Global Times learned that some Chinese national lawmakers and political advisors have submitted their motions and proposals to the ongoing national two sessions, calling for better protecting women´s rights and improving women´s living and working conditions.Recently, the topic of discrimination against women in employment is resonating with a large number of netizens. Analysts believe fear of salary reduction, dismissal, impact on probation and promotion and salary increases are the main concerns of pregnant female employees.Zhang Guangdong, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), submitted a proposal calling to implement an employment guarantee policy for women of childbearing age.According to Zhang´s proposal obtained by the Global Times on Wednesday, Zhang proposed to implement the existing employment security policy for women of childbearing age at the legal level, further clarify the scope of compensation for infringement of women´s equal employment rights, and appropriately increase the amount of compensation for mental damage, so as to play an effective warning and punishment role for employers who violate the rules.Zhang said China should set up special agencies in departments to supervise enterprises in establishing equal payment systems for equal work and fair promotion systems to ensure that national and local policies on protecting women´s rights are implemented.Separately, a senior mathematician who is also a national political advisor urged for breaking the glass ceiling for women in science sector and more women´s participation in the field of science and technology to improve gender equality in the field.According to a proposal the Global Times obtained from Yuan Yaxiang, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), also vice-president of the China Association for Science and Technology, women have great intellectual potential in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and are a key force in the development of scientific and technological innovation.At present, women´s participation in STEM fields is far from sufficient. Yuan said the minimum proportion of female scientific and technological talents should be stipulated and increased in scientific and technological decision-making units such as academic committees at all levels and project and talent title review groups, to enhance women´s voices in the field.Yuan proposed increasing the level of support for women for professional title promotion, project reviews, awards and other aspects. And the upper age limits of talent programs and projects should be relaxed for women.Authorities should formulate preferential policies to encourage female scientists to take charge of high-level and major projects, support and train more high-level female scientific and technological talents and reserve teams in a bid to break the glass ceiling for women in STEM fields.China has always paid high attention to continuously improving equal rights and opportunities for women.On Tuesday, Lin Yi, Vice-Chairperson of National Working Committee on Children and Women under the State Council, addressed UN Security Council´s open debate that that China is a champion of gender equality and a campaigner for women´s empowerment. In the process of promoting Chinese modernization, the status of Chinese women has undergone earth-shaking changes, with a growing sense of fulfillment, happiness and security, Lin said.Lin noted that China calls on the international community to increase input and speed up the implementation of the commitment of the Agenda for Women´s Peace and Security, and inject new impetus into the global cause of gender equality and women´s development.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219170.html,9,3,2023,"['women', 'national', 'political', 'rights', 'global', 'china', 'times', 'employment', 'female', 'zhang', 'security', 'level', 'equal', 'science', 'scientific', 'technological', 'promotion', 'committee', 'proposal', 'age']",0.29320616883116873,0.1286659322820037,9/3/2023

I want to put this on record. Eight out of 10 countries in ASEAN have got very ambitious nationally determined contributions targets,"" Taufik said, adding that the big challenge is to ""put these aims in order and match them with real pragmatic actions.""The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the 2022 energy market volatility have added a ""big catalyst to invest in renewable energy from the energy security point of view,"" rather than just ""investing in renewables because of the sustainability,"" Liza Mustapha, executive vice president and group chief financial officer of Petronas, said in a separate panel.She said the company attaches great importance to addressing the energy trilemma of energy security, affordability and sustainability.There is a need for a ""balanced view"" on the energy transition in the developing economies since they ""have people to feed,"" said Bharrat Jagdeo, vice president of Guyana, during the CERAWeek.Even with 10 FPSOs (floating production storage and off-loading) operating offshore in Guyana, ""we will be carbon negative,"" he told the audience.""The world is hoping to get to carbon negative in 2050, but we are already there.

I have witnessed rapid development of Tibet power industry: NPC deputy - People's Daily Online,"I have witnessed rapid development of Tibet power industry: NPC deputy (Ecns.cn) 08:48, March 09, 2023(ECNS) -- ""My hometown is Riwoqe County in Qamdo Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region. I used oil lamps when I was a child and had electric lights during elementary and middle school, but at that time, power outages were frequent. Nowadays, Tibet definitely does not lack electricity, "" said Zhaxi Nyima, who is a deputy team leader at the urban power supply service center of State Grid Lhasa Power Supply Company as well as a deputy to the 14th National People´s Congress.Zhaxi Nyima is repairing electricity failure. (Photo provided from Zhaxi Nyima)During an interview with China News Network, Zhaxi Nyima told the story of how the residents in his hometown had access to electricity at first and then, an upgraded power supply service.He recalled that in 1990, he left home for the first time to attend a hydroelectric technical school in Lhasa.""At that time, the Lhasa urban area mainly relied on the Najin hydroelectric power station for electricity. During the peak season in winter, each area took turns to get power supply, including schools,"" he said.After graduating in 1993, Zhaxi Nyima was assigned to work at the Najin Hydropower Station, where he was responsible for the operation and maintenance of the generator units.""My job was to monitor the four hydroelectric turbine units. During the summer when the water flow in the Lhasa River was high, all four units would operate. But when the water flow reduced in winter, only two units could operate,"" Zhaxi Nyima said. adding that not until the end of the 1990s did Lhasa city solved power shortages.In 2005, he joined the urban distribution repair team to repair power failures in residential areas.Afterward, the development of Tibet´s electric power industry entered the ""fast lane.""At the end of 2011, the Qinghai-Tibet Grid Interconnection Project with a total investment of 16.286 billion yuan ($2.34 billion ) was put into operation; On November 20, 2014, the Sichuan-Tibet Power Grid Interconnection Project, which connected the Qamdo power grid in Tibet and the power grid in Sichuan, was put into operation.On November 23, 2018, the Central Tibet Power Grid Interconnection Project, which broke multiple records in the construction and operation of power grid projects, was completed and put into operation.In December 2020, the Ali-Tibet Central Power Grid Interconnection Project was officially put into operation, marking Tibet´s entry into the era of a unified power grid covering all 7 cities and 74 counties (districts) in the region.""Now that people have sufficient electricity, we are thinking about how to upgrade power supply services,"" he said.In the past, the electric wires in the old area of Lhasa were like spider webs, intertwined with various pipelines, resulting in high failure rates and difficulty in repairing.""For example, if a large courtyard in a street reported a power outage, we had to climb up the electric pole while another colleague would search for the corresponding faulty line nearby and pull it so that we could find the specific failured line, reconnect it, and restore power,"" he said.""Later, the old city area was renovated, and all pipelines were placed underground, and the spider web-like electric wires became a thing of the past,"" he added.In order to further improve the experience of residents using electricity, Zhaxi Nyima and three others were sent to other provinces by their company in 2016 to learn about live-line work and emergency repairs. In 2017, the Live-Line Operation and Maintenance Team was officially established in Lhasa City Power Supply Service Center.""Now, for some faults, we can quietly fix them during live-line work, without power outages, and the people are actually unaware of the process,"" said Zhaxi Nyima. He added that this is a kind of progress, indicating that the electricity-using experience of the Tibetan people is improving.According to official information released by the Tibet Autonomous Region in October 2022, the cumulative investment in the construction of the Tibet power grid reached nearly 70 billion yuan in the past decade, exceeding the total investment in power grid construction over the past 60 years.The State Grid Tibet Electric Power Co., Ltd. has reported that the electricity consumption in Tibet has maintained a double-digit growth rate for several years, increasing from 2.77 billion kilowatt-hours in 2012 to 11.86 billion kilowatt-hours in 2022.""I have witnessed the rapid development of the Tibet power industry,"" Zhaxi Nyima said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219139.html,9,3,2023,"['power', 'tibet', 'grid', 'zhaxi', 'nyima', 'electricity', 'lhasa', 'operation', 'electric', 'supply', 'billion', 'line', 'area', 'units', 'interconnection', 'project', 'put', 'past', 'development', 'industry']",0.3487089947089947,0.03872486772486772,9/3/2023

North Carolina schools see spike in reported violence numbers: U.S. media - People's Daily Online,"North Carolina schools see spike in reported violence numbers: U.S. media (Xinhua) 10:42, March 08, 2023NEW YORK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- There has been a 23.5 percent spike in crime and violence in high schools in the U.S. state of North Carolina, compared to the previous year, FOX 8 reported, citing the latest report released by the state´s Department of Public Instruction (DPI).These numbers are raising concerns among education officials, parents, and lawmakers, said FOX 8 in a recent report of the trend.According to the DPI´s consolidated data report, over the last year, North Carolina schools reported more than 11,000 acts of crime and violence. Possession of controlled substances was the highest reported crime, and closely following that was possession of a weapon, followed by assaulting staff.Daniel Miles, a licensed clinical mental health counselor, thinks the COVID-19 pandemic plays a huge role in the sharp rise.""Whatever´s going on as far as how stressed teachers are feeling, how stressed parents are feeling, kids are feeling that and don't know how to put words to that.

UN chief proposes Emergency Platform to help tackle global shocks - People's Daily Online,"UN chief proposes Emergency Platform to help tackle global shocks (Xinhua) 08:49, March 10, 2023UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday proposed strengthening the international response to complex global shocks through an ""Emergency Platform.""The global response to such shocks is often ad hoc, fragmented, and improvised. There is a need for a mechanism to tackle multidimensional threats with a multidimensional response, he said in his presentation of a policy brief for the Summit of the Future scheduled for 2024.""Our global interconnectedness means that shocks that occur in one country or sector can quickly have cascading consequences elsewhere, often in unforeseen ways. Those shocks are coming at us with greater strength and frequency, with serious implications for peace and security, economic stability, and environmental sustainability,"" he said.Those shocks can have a disproportionate impact in some areas. Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the global cost-of-living crisis hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest, throwing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) progress and Agenda 2030 further off-track, he added.For the sake of a more formal, predictable, and structured approach, the Emergency Platform would leverage the United Nations' convening power and capacities in a timely and predictable way. It would identify and bring together actors at the appropriate level to respond. It would be flexible and agile, responding to different types of shocks. Crucially, it would promote a global response based on solidarity and equity, and the key principle of leaving no one behind. All people and countries hit by a shock must have access to the support they need, said Guterres.Accountability would be built into the Emergency Platform, in order to hold all parties to their concrete commitments, he said.While decisions would continue to lie with member states, the Emergency Platform would also include the private sector, civil society, and other non-state partners with an ability to contribute to the global response.But he clarified that the Emergency Platform would not be a standing entity or body. It would, instead, consist of a set of protocols around convening key actors in the event of complex, global shocks, and operationalizing their coordinated response.The Emergency Platform would not displace or duplicate the work of intergovernmental bodies, including the Security Council. Nor would it interfere with the mandate of specialized agencies or existing mechanisms. It would be a tool for the multilateral system to support intergovernmental decisions and complement existing mechanisms, he said.The United Nations is the only organization that can bring together all stakeholders in the event of complex global shocks, and has them work together to the best effect. It is time to take decisions that enable it to do so, said the UN chief.Another policy brief presented to UN member states by Guterres concerns how to take the future into account in decision-making and deliver on responsibilities to generations yet to be born.""Achieving the SDGs, upholding the rights and meeting the needs of people alive today are clearly preconditions for a better future. At the same time, we must make those decisions with an eye on the future, recognizing the rights and interests of people who are not yet born,"" he said.Most members of future generations will be born in countries that are currently low- and middle-income ones. They are likely to live in places that are already suffering the effects of poverty, hunger, the climate crisis, crippling debt, discrimination and inequality. The policy brief makes it clear that a secure and equitable future starts now, he said. ""Considering the future pays off in the present.""The policy brief proposes three concrete steps at the global level.First, it proposes the appointment of an envoy who will be the global voice for future generations, raising awareness about the impacts on them of the decisions that are taken today.Second, it proposes ideas to inform a political declaration defining duties to the future. This would be an opportunity to consolidate the commitments already made to future generations and to adapt these commitments to new challenges.Third, it proposes a dedicated intergovernmental forum, where member states could advance the commitments in the declaration and share experiences and innovations. The brief, therefore, recommends the establishment of a Commission on Future Generations as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly.""These first two policy briefs start our contribution to the consideration by member states of the decisions and changes needed to equip the multilateral system for the challenges of today and the future,"" said Guterres.Nine more policy briefs for the Summit of the Future will be published by July.The goal is simple: to breathe new life into the multilateral system so that it can deliver on the promises of the UN Charter and the 2030 Agenda, he said. ""As our world becomes more complex, more uncertain, and more dangerous, we have an even greater responsibility to strengthen the multilateral system. That must be the ultimate aim of the Summit of the Future.""The SDG Summit this September and the Summit of the Future in 2024 are key moments for member states to come together around the decisions necessary to put the world back on track to a fair, inclusive, and sustainable future for all, he said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219712.html,10,3,2023,"['future', 'global', 'shocks', 'emergency', 'platform', 'decisions', 'response', 'policy', 'proposes', 'summit', 'member', 'states', 'generations', 'guterres', 'complex', 'commitments', 'multilateral', 'system', 'united', 'nations']",0.36222355543007706,0.06830533596837944,10/3/2023

The report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang on March 5 emphasized high-quality and green development.Agshin Aliyev, an Azerbaijani Sinologist, said the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the expectation of ordinary people. The Chinese government is made up of experienced politicians and administrators who understand the feelings of the people and work for the benefit of the people.Bart Edes, distinguished fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said the Chinese government is trying to strike a balance between its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2060 and its need for stable and secure energy supplies.Edes said the optimization of COVID-19 policies has stimulated a surge in consumption and business activity in China that makes the government´s growth target of around 5 percent for 2023""look achievable — and perhaps even conservative"".""Last month, the purchasing managers index for the manufacturing industry reached its highest level in more than 10 years,"" he said.Budiman from Australia added that China´s success in dealing with COVID-19 prevents new suffering that could threaten the global health situation, and provides optimism for people worldwide that the pandemic may near its end this year.""We will enter a new phase of COVID-19 which is either endemic or small outbreaks, (but) under control,"" he said.'Pragmatic approach'Fu Xiaolan, fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences and director of the Technology and Management Center for Development at the University of Oxford, said China´s GDP growth target was ""slightly lower"" than what she had expected.""I think it´s an honest, pragmatic approach toward China´s growth,"" she said at a panel discussion during the 10th Oxford China Forum held at Oxford University on Sunday. The target suggests that authorities are aiming for high-quality development rather than pursuing pure high growth, she added.Tianchen Xu, an economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said achieving the 5 percent GDP growth target should not be difficult, ""given the low base of comparison last year and the robust recovery we're seeing now"".He said that he would not regard the relatively conservative GDP target as being an indication of government ""pessimism"", and suggested that the actual growth could come in far higher.Such growth of China will be conducive to global rebound with increasing international cooperation, not only in economic and trade fields, but also educational and cultural exchanges which bring tangible benefits to the people, Aliyev from Azerbaijan added.He Xiating in London contributed to this story.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219719.html,10,3,2023,"['china', 'growth', 'target', 'government', 'development', 'gdp', 'high', 'quality', 'global', 'work', 'green', 'positive', 'health', 'security', 'budiman', 'university', 'level', 'report', 'covid', 'added']",0.3759422997094229,0.09050910276937674,10/3/2023

U.S. regulators close Silicon Valley Bank - People's Daily Online,"U.S. regulators close Silicon Valley Bank (Xinhua) 14:06, March 11, 2023SAN FRANCISCO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the 16th largest bank in the United States, was closed on Friday by regulators, according to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).An FDIC memo released on Friday said the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed the bank after its stocks sputtered. The bank´s operations will resume on Monday with the FDIC in charge.All insured depositors will have ""full access"" to ""insured"" deposits no later than Monday morning, and official checks ""will continue to clear,"" said the FDIC.Deposit insurance, as per the FDIC´s definition, means that deposits are insured up to 250,000 U.S. dollars per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.The move came after the Santa Clara-headquartered bank announced Wednesday that it lost 1.8 billion dollars in the sale of U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it had invested in, owing to rising interest rates. The bank was also facing shrinking deposits as the tech industry struggled.Panic ensued, leading the share price to tank sharply and triggering the run on the 40-year-old bank that holds 210 billion dollars in assets.The SVB´s failure is the largest bank failure since the collapse of U.S. savings and loan association Washington Mutual in 2008, The Associated Press reported.More than half of the bank´s current loans went to major venture capital and private equity firms, while another quarter went to tech and life sciences companies.The bank has an estimated 6,500 employees, according to U.S. online newspaper TechCrunch. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220581.html,11,3,2023,"['bank', 'fdic', 'insured', 'deposits', 'dollars', 'regulators', 'silicon', 'valley', 'svb', 'largest', 'closed', 'friday', 'deposit', 'insurance', 'monday', 'billion', 'tech', 'failure', 'close', 'san']",0.30192307692307685,-0.04711538461538462,11/3/2023

U.S. community in shock after record methane leak: The Guardian - People's Daily Online,"U.S. community in shock after record methane leak: The Guardian (Xinhua) 10:47, March 09, 2023LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Following the biggest methane leak in Pennsylvania´s history -- and one of the worst ever detected in the United States, the local community has been living in shock and fear, The Guardian has reported.Over the few weeks after the leak happened in November last year, more than a billion cubic feet of methane and other toxins were spewed into the atmosphere from a failed storage well at an ageing fossil-fuel facility run by Equitrans Midstream Corporation on Rager Mountain in Jackson Township, it said on Monday.Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that warms the Earth´s atmosphere much faster than carbon dioxide (CO2), and today is responsible for about 25 percent of the heat trapped by all greenhouse gases, it said.According to some calculations, the Jackson Township leak was equivalent to planet-warming emissions from burning more than 1,080 rail cars of coal or from running 360,000 cars for a year, it said.The Guardian said the relentless racket and stench caused the local people to suffer severe headaches, lightheadedness, sore throat, burning nose, nausea and sleep deprivation as the company struggled to plug the leak.""We have major gas infrastructure built out all over the place but don't have the powers or resources to regulate everything that´s going on; this is the wild west.

Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? - People's Daily Online,"Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? (Xinhua) 11:01, March 11, 2023-- ""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.-- China always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.-- The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For a long time in history, the world was shrouded in the myth that modernization equals Westernization. The emergence of Chinese modernization dispels it, making modernization no longer a single-choice question, but a multiple-choice one.For the world, China´s task to modernize a country of 1.4 billion people, or nearly one-fifth of the global population, is unprecedented. The Herculean pursuit not only captures global attention, but also has global ramifications.Among a series of concepts and initiatives that China promotes in both state governance and global interactions, the Chinese path to modernization is the most popular keyword that people would like to know more about, according to an overseas survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency recently.WHAT ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHINESE AND WESTERN MODERNIZATION?China´s path to modernization is one of peace and development, win-win cooperation, and harmony between humanity and nature, rather than external expansion and plundering.""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.""The modernization of a small number of Western countries was based on the exploitation, oppression and colonization of almost the entire world. China is not developing by exploiting any other country; China is developing itself and modernizing itself, and at the same time helping other countries to develop and modernize,"" he said.China does not seek to exploit or control other nations, and it plays no role in inciting conflicts, said Mokhtar Gobashy, deputy chairman of the Cairo-based Arab Center for Political and Strategic Studies, adding that´s why China has gained respect and popularity in the Arab world.Meanwhile, Chinese modernization emphasizes both material and cultural-ethical advancement, which distinguishes it from Western modernization, said Chen Gang, assistant director of the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore.The coordination of material and cultural-ethical advancement leads the way to realize all-around material abundance as well as people´s well-rounded development, Chen said.WHAT CHINESE MODERNIZATION CAN OFFER FOR THE WORLD?China stands in the world as the second-largest economy and a responsible major country. It always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.Firstly, China is committed to making the world less poor and more equitable.By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.Commenting on China´s poverty reduction drive, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said those achievements are ""the biggest contribution for dramatical reduction of poverty.""More than eradicating absolute poverty, Chinese modernization promotes common prosperity, thereby shrinking the enormous wealth gap and inequality that have risen in tandem with Western modernization.British scholar and political commentator Martin Jacques highlighted China´s pursuit of common prosperity, lamenting how Western countries have never taken it seriously.""For China to embrace common prosperity, to establish a society of greater fairness, greater equity, that is a very important message not only to China, Chinese people but to the world as well,"" he said.China, on its way toward modernization, has also been sharing its development dividends with the rest of the world.Take the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to a World Bank forecast, if all Belt and Road transport infrastructure projects are carried out, the initiative would generate 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars of global revenues annually to 2030. Up to 90 percent of the revenues would go to partner countries.""The most important thing about the BRI is that developing nations could benefit from the great experience in the development of China. BRI gives them the opportunity to create an industrial society and join the modern age. This is something that in the long run would bode well for the future of humanity,"" said Khairy Tourk, professor of economics with the Stuart School of Business at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.Secondly, China is committed to making the world greener and more biodiverse.China ranks first globally in the area of planted forests and forest coverage growth, contributing a quarter of the world´s new forest area in the past decade.From 2012 to 2021, China´s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP declined by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal.So far, China has also emerged as a major proponent of renewable energy, and it is working hard to capitalize on the potential of a green BRI.UNFCCC (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Executive Secretary Simon Stiell spoke highly of China´s firm and consistent stance on actively addressing climate change, as well as its efforts to translate climate commitments into concrete actions.At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis, China continues to make solid progress in dealing with climate change and plays an important role in advancing the global response to climate change, Stiell said.Meanwhile, under China´s presidency, the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the global biodiversity framework ahead of schedule. China has shown leadership in global biodiversity protection, Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, has said.Thirdly, China is committed to making the world more peaceful.For more than 70 years, China has never started a war, never occupied a single square mile of foreign territory, never engaged in proxy wars, and never been a member of or organized any military bloc.It is the only country that has incorporated peaceful development in its Constitution, and the only country among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge no first use of nuclear weapons. China´s track record on peace can stand the scrutiny of history, and its peaceful rise is an unprecedented miracle in human history.Since China´s restoration of its lawful seat at the United Nations in 1971, China has actively participated in the political settlement of major regional hot issues, including the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and the Palestine-Israel issue.In response to mounting conflicts and security challenges in today´s world, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022.And in the GSI Concept Paper released last month, China further expounded the core ideas and principles of the initiative, identified the priorities, platforms and mechanisms of cooperation and demonstrated China´s sense of responsibility for safeguarding world peace and firm resolve to defend global security.""China´s idea of being a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods are consistent with the ideals of the UN Charter,"" former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said.People visit Jianchang ancient city during the Spring Festival holiday in Xichang, southwest China´s Sichuan Province, on Jan. 27, 2023. (Photo by Li Jieyi/Xinhua)AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH?Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization,"" presents another picture of modernization, expands the channels for developing countries to achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity, Xi once said.China´s rise as a global economic power shattered the long-held notion that modernization means Westernization, said David Monyae, director of the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg.The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.""They could find in this model elements for the construction of a development path that can enable them to handle present and future challenges,"" he said.""Modernization has never been simply Westernization,"" Chen said, adding that ""Chinese modernization is a new development model, which can be used as a reference for other countries with similar national conditions or at a similar stage of development."" ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220417.html,11,3,2023,"['china', 'modernization', 'development', 'global', 'countries', 'path', 'peace', 'developing', 'poverty', 'history', 'long', 'secretary', 'country', 'western', 'nations', 'climate', 'vice', 'years', 'general', 'westernization']",0.32192573518435597,0.05357008508732647,11/3/2023

K.

The state-run National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has been directed to run its 5,000 MW gas-based power stations during the crunch period in April-May.In addition, 4,000 MW of additional gas-based power capacity would be added by other entities for availability during the summer months.Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) has already assured the ministry of power of the necessary supply of gas during the summer months.As per estimates of the Central Electricity Authority, the peak electricity demand is expected to be 229 GW during April, the highest period in the country.The energy demand is expected to be 142,097 million units (MU) during April, the highest in the year 2023 before reducing to 141,464 MU in May and further declining continuously to 117,049 MU during November.The unusually high temperatures in India last year triggered a spike in power demand, leading to outages in many states.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219734.html,10,3,2023,"['power', 'ministry', 'coal', 'demand', 'based', 'months', 'plants', 'gas', 'summer', 'directed', 'period', 'electricity', 'april', 'ensure', 'india', 'availability', 'meet', 'run', 'rakes', 'mu']",0.46414682539682534,0.09507936507936508,10/3/2023

There were no reported fatalities or injuries, according to a report issued by the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB).Responders mitigated the fire on Feb. 5, the NTSB report said. But five derailed ""specification tank cars carrying 115,580 gallons of vinyl chloride"" continued to concern authorities because the temperature inside one tank car was still rising.The NTSB said responders later scheduled a ""controlled venting"" of the five vinyl chloride tank cars to release and burn the vinyl chloride and dug ditches to contain released vinyl chloride liquid while it vaporized and burned.The controlled venting began on Feb. 6, which discharged toxic and potentially deadly fumes into the air.While residents were allowed to return to their homes in East Palestine two days later, they remain concerned about the handling of the incident as well as the health impact of exposure to those chemicals.Headache, anxiety, coughing, fatigue and irritation, pain, and burning of the skin continue to be the most common symptoms reported by residents in the East Palestine area, according to a health assessment survey.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw testifies at a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on protecting public health and the environment in the wake of the Norfolk Southern train derailment and chemical release in East Palestine, Ohio in Washington, D.C., the United States, March 9, 2023.

Successful COVID fight sets example - People's Daily Online,"Successful COVID fight sets exampleBy LI LEI (China Daily) 09:45, March 08, 2023A medical worker administers a dose of COVID-19 vaccine to a senior resident in Hufeng village of Wenchang, South China´s Hainan province, Dec 22, 2022. [Photo/Xinhua]Populous nations can learn from China´s experience during pandemicChina, with one-fifth of the global population, triumphantly exited the three-year COVID-19 pandemic with the lowest cost in terms of human life, setting a good example for other populous countries, experts said.Based on the success, Chinese policymakers, in retrospect, are proposing wide-ranging reforms aimed at consolidating the country´s public health system.Legislative suggestions on that front have become trending topics during the annual two sessions — the meetings of the National People´s Congress and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference National Committee.The top legislature and the political advisory body are currently meeting in Beijing.The spread of the disease has ""basically ended"" among the country´s 1.4 billion people, with only smaller, sporadic infections still occurring, Liang Wannian, head of the National Health Commission´s expert panel on the response to COVID-19, said at a closely watched news conference last month.He said China has blazed a trail showing how countries with a sizable population can evade a major pandemic.The comments came after a ""major, decisive victory"" in the fight against the disease was declared on Feb 16 at a key meeting of the Communist Party of China.Presided over by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, the meeting agreed that China has created a miracle in the history of human civilization for a country with a vast population to successfully prevail over a pandemic.Speaking at the news conference held by the State Council´s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism, the country´s COVID-19 task force, NHC spokesman Mi Feng said the Omicron-fueled outbreak — which had led to a spike in locally transmitted cases nationwide from November — has subsided and turned out for the better.He said the past three years have witnessed the constant fine-tuning of China´s COVID strategy, including the downgrading of the management of the disease in January in light of the virus' decreasing virulence.The dynamic adjustment has helped strike a balance between disease control and economic growth, and worked to check the spread of the more lethal lineages of the novel coronavirus earlier.""It effectively protected people´s lives and health,"" Mi said.Official figures showed that since November, China has treated 200 million infected patients, including nearly 800,000 critically ill patients, and that the death rate from COVID-19 has remained at the lowest level in the world.According to the National Health Commission in July, China´s average life expectancy continued to rise amid the pandemic, from 77.93 years in 2020 to 78.2 years in 2021.Meanwhile, average life expectancy in the United States — home to an advanced health system — fell over the same period from 77 years in 2020 to 76.1 years in 2021, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the country´s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The total number of COVID-related deaths in the US had reached 1.1 million by January, according to the CDC.China´s regularly modified COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plans, which offer guidance to front-line medics, were the secret to underpinning China´s success in saving lives, experts said.China has introduced 10 such plans and four plans for treating COVID patients in critical condition over the course of three years.Speaking at a news conference on Feb 27, Guo Yanhong, director of the NHC´s health emergency division, said the evolving plans informed doctors of what parameters to track in patients so that doctors can intervene earlier and prevent them from descending into life-threatening conditions.She said the plans represented increasing understanding of the virus, including its symptoms, virulence and modes of transmission. More recent plans have advocated a number of effective treatments, such as blood plasma taken from patients that have recovered, and newly approved antiviral drugs.""The plans were adjusted according to increasing knowledge of the virus,"" Guo said.China kept its border controls in place until January. By this time, the dominant Omicron subvariants were much less deadly than their predecessors, and more than 90 percent of the Chinese people had been vaccinated.The combined factors have laid foundations for China´s economy, which slowed during pandemic-triggered lockdowns, to rebound faster than many Western observers had expected.The National Bureau of Statistics said on March 1 that a gauge of manufacturing rose at the fastest pace in more than a decade in February, while export orders expanded. Services and construction activity also expanded further.On the back of China´s achievements, the virus also exposed some of the long-running shortcomings in the country´s emerging public health system. They have gained the attention of multiple NPC deputies and members of the CPPCC National Committee this year.Li Yan, a national lawmaker and chief executive officer of Qilu Pharmaceutical, a private drugmaker in Jinan, Shandong province, said that the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province in late 2019 had temporarily fallen into a shortage of medics and overstretched hospitals.To address the problem, authorities mobilized medics and resources in non-affected regions to help out in hard-hit cities, which had effectively worked but should not be the ""lasting solution"", she said in an interview with the Economic Observer newspaper.Li suggested that authorities build a public health service network with multiple community-based outposts, which are tasked with detecting and reporting infectious diseases, in the hope of nipping any potential outbreak in the bud.Zhu Tao, a political adviser behind China´s first single-dose adenovirus vaccine for COVID-19, said vaccines have become the central pillar of China´s COVID control now that many pandemic restrictions have been eliminated.""Vaccines are the cheapest option for society as a whole, and have the minimum impact on the economy compared with other options,"" he told China Youth Daily.Zhu, who works for CanSino Biologics and led the research on the company´s messenger RNA COVID vaccine, which is now under clinical trial, suggested that efforts be made to standardize the emergency use of medications and more so that China can better cope with future public health emergencies.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218567.html,8,3,2023,"['china', 'covid', 'health', 'national', 'plans', 'pandemic', 'country', 'years', 'disease', 'patients', 'life', 'public', 'conference', 'control', 'virus', 'li', 'vaccine', 'province', 'population', 'system']",0.37929178664472785,0.10464349376114082,8/3/2023
Interview: China's path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China´s path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist (Xinhua) 11:56, March 11, 2023LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China has blazed a path to modernization that suits its society and harmonizes with the environment, a renowned British sociologist has said.""There are two things (about the Chinese path to modernization) which stand out for me: the scale of the task with such a large population on one side, harmony with nature on the other,"" Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.Albrow said that, given the sheer size of China´s population, the amazing pace of its modernization has greatly impressed him.Harmony between humanity and nature is a theme that goes back millennia into Chinese history, the sociologist said. ""It shows that the emphasis China gives to that means that modernization does not discard the past; it adopts the past and carries the past forward.""""Modernization is congruent with the culture of China itself,"" Albrow said.The Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development, he said.Albrow explained that modernization means applying science and technology to human organizations.""On the back of the development of modern technologies, modernization allows countries to take their own culture forward,"" he said. ""Every country is able to develop modernity in the way that suits its own culture.""""China has given an example to the world of how you can have a culturally-led modernization program,"" he added.Albrow, author of the book China and the Shared Human Future: Exploring Common Values and Goals, said that as the world turns its attention to the ongoing ""two sessions"" held in Beijing, it´s important for China to demonstrate that ""democracy comes in many different forms"" and that ""China is moving forward all the time.""The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual meetings of the National People´s Congress, the country´s national legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.""The Chinese version of democracy is one which enlists the support of the whole population, through the efforts of the Communist Party of China to produce a coherent approach to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""China´s form of democracy is an evolving form of discussion and debate, but one which is built upon the consensus of society as a whole.""""It´s a profound kind of democracy and very different from the kinds which exist in so many Western countries, the kinds of democracies that exist, for instance, (in) the United Kingdom or the United States, ones which tend to produce disagreements"" and make it difficult for a country to take any single path into the future, despite its continual debate and discussion about how to go forward, according to Albrow.""Democracy is not a stable condition; democracy is something which is continually moving forward,"" he continued, adding that ""China is in a position now, in this particular 'two sessions', to take us forward again, with well-judged reforms of its own system.""Albrow is confident in the CPC´s resolve to further reforms that will remove institutional obstacles to fulfill Chinese modernization. Over the past decades, the CPC has shown the courage to develop and introduce changes and reforms, he said.

The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils - People's Daily Online,"The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils (Xinhua) 17:04, February 03, 2023BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its PerilsFebruary 2023ContentsIntroductionI. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm JurisdictionII. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm JurisdictionIII. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm JurisdictionConclusionIntroductionThe United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, including both its allies and countries with which it has hostile or strained relations. In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with U.S. ""arms"" stretching longer and longer. Examining cases of U.S. abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.I. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction◆According to U.S. domestic law, long-arm jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over persons or entities domiciled or resident outside the territory of the sanctioning state. First established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945), long-arm jurisdiction allows state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction in civil and commercial cases where jurisdiction cannot be exercised because the defendant is not domiciled in the state, on the basis that the defendant has some ""minimum contacts"" with the state.◆According to international law, the exercise of a country´s jurisdiction over an extraterritorial person or entity generally requires that the person or entity or its conduct has a real and sufficient connection to that country. Yet the U.S. exercises long-arm jurisdiction on the basis of the ""minimum contacts"" rule, constantly lowering the threshold for application. Even the flimsiest connection with the United States, such as having a branch in the United States, using U.S. dollar for clearing or other financial services, or using the U.S. mail system, constitutes ""minimum contacts.""◆To exercise long-arm jurisdiction, the United States has further developed the ""effects doctrine,"" meaning that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever an act occurring abroad produces ""effects"" in the United States, regardless of whether the actor has U.S. citizenship or residency, and regardless of whether the act complies with the law of the place where it occurred. The United States has also been expanding the scope of its long-arm jurisdiction to exert disproportionate and unwarranted jurisdiction over extraterritorial persons or entities, enforcing U.S. domestic laws on extraterritorial non-US persons or entities, and wantonly penalizing or threatening foreign companies by exploiting their reliance on dollar-denominated businesses, the U.S. market or U.S. technologies.◆In essence, long-arm jurisdiction is an arbitrary judicial practice, wielded by the U.S. government on the strength of its national power and financial hegemony, to enforce extraterritorial jurisdiction over entities and individuals of other countries on the ground of its domestic law.II. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction◆In the many years of exercising such jurisdiction, the United States has gradually developed a massive, mutually reinforcing and interlocking legal system for long-arm jurisdiction, and continued to lower the threshold and expand its discretionary power, thus shaping long-arm jurisdiction into a tool for the United States to advance hegemonic diplomacy and pursue economic interests. Such practice disregards other countries' sovereignty, blatantly meddles in others' internal affairs, seriously damages the legitimate interests of other countries, and disrupts the normal order of international exchanges. The expansion of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is all-dimensional. Citing the ""minimum contacts"" rule and the ""effects doctrine,"" the United States has developed massive and complex legal and enforcement systems to support its long-arm jurisdiction which is expanding in scope and fields of application.◆ Long-arm jurisdiction has also become a means by which the United States abuses unilateral sanctions, especially secondary sanctions. To ensure the extraterritorial effects of U.S. sanction laws, the United States would usually exercise judicial authority to hold extraterritorial entities and individuals accountable for failing to comply with U.S. sanction laws. In addition to long-arm jurisdiction, administrative, economic, financial and other means would also be employed to implement its secondary sanctions.◆Compulsory extraterritorial evidence collection is another important means of long-arm jurisdiction. In the judicial process involving other countries, the United States frequently takes unilateral compulsory measures to collect evidence outside its own territory, circumventing normal channels of judicial and law enforcement cooperation between countries. It would directly ask banks and Internet firms that have branches or are listed in the United States to provide evidence such as account information and data located outside the United States. When other countries try to raise démarche, the United States would always respond by citing excuses such as ""judicial independence"" or ""low efficiency in normal judicial assistance or law enforcement cooperation."" These typical examples of long-arm jurisdiction have severely damaged other countries' judicial sovereignty, and the legitimate rights and interests of those subjects of evidence collection.◆The United States has put in place a whole-of-government system to practice long-arm jurisdiction, which features a division of labor among departments and inter-agency collaboration. The President and Congress are the main decision makers when it comes to sanctions. The President decides on most of the economic sanctions, and Congress participates through legislative activities under specific circumstances. At the heart of sanctions enforcement is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency under Treasury responsible for freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction, formulating and adjusting lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, and reviewing and issuing licenses. The Department of State´s Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) is responsible for developing and implementing foreign policy-related sanctions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), an agency of the Department of Commerce, administers separate lists from the OFAC. On top of these, the U.S. government bolsters its sanctions enforcement through control of SWIFT and CHIPS, two major cross-border payment and clearing systems, by pressing them, when it deems necessary, to cut off contact with the financial institutions of the subject country to achieve the purpose of economic sanctions.◆The United States has stepped up legislation for long-arm jurisdiction. A wide range of laws in the United States advance long-arm jurisdiction, including Trading with the Enemy Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Countering America´s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and Helms-Burton Act. Others such as the USA PATRIOT Act and National Defense Authorization Act contain long-arm jurisdiction clauses. A number of presidential executive orders also involve long-arm jurisdiction. More and more U.S. federal legislation contains long-arm jurisdiction clauses to prevent Americans from circumventing U.S. laws by establishing subsidiaries in foreign countries, or foreigners enjoying less restrictions than Americans, or relevant international rules-making hurting U.S. interests. These legislative moves allow the United States to enforce long-arm jurisdiction in its diplomacy by citing domestic laws.◆ There is a growing tendency of the U.S. applying long-arm jurisdiction to criminal cases, which is an extreme abuse of the practice. In recent years, a number of U.S. federal laws include extraterritorial clauses, which have been exploited by the Department of Justice to launch criminal investigations and prosecutions. In these proceedings, federal courts begin to apply the concept of long-arm jurisdiction when examining the basis of their jurisdiction by broadly interpreting the connection between the case and the United States, expanding the scope of personal and territorial jurisdiction, and lowering the threshold for the application of protective jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.III. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction◆The United States is the only sanctions superpower in the world. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021,the number of active U.S. sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400.◆Sanctions strain relations between countries and undermine the international order. Healthy state-to-state relations are the bedrock for peace and stability in the international order. In the 1990s, the United States introduced the Helms-Burton Act to impose economic sanctions through long-arm jurisdiction on individuals and entities worldwide conducting transactions with Cuba. It sparked strong opposition from the European Union, who in 1996 passed the Blocking Statute to neutralize through legislation the effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction within the EU, and enable individuals and entities in the EU to sue individuals and entities in the United States. Apart from this, the EU put forward a series of proposals and initiatives at the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the World Trade Organization and other international bodies, calling on the international community to pay attention to the harmful effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction, and even resorted to the WTO dispute settlement procedures. So far, the ""long arm"" of U.S. jurisdiction has reached China, Russia, Iran, Syria, the DPRK, Cuba, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, among others. In an article published in Foreign Affairs, Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University criticized successive U.S. administrations for abusing economic coercion and economic violence and using sanctions as the preferred solution to diplomatic problems, which have been ineffective and causing humanitarian disasters.◆Since 1979, the United States has imposed various types of unilateral sanctions on Iran and other countries. In 1996, it rolled out the D'Amato Act which forbids foreign companies from investing in the energy sector of Iran and Libya, resulting in long-term damaging ramifications. Afterward, the United States keeps ramping up sanctions against Iran. Under the Trump administration, it harbored a policy of ""maximum pressure"" and wanted to use sanctions to effect a regime change in Iran. According to then Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, sanctions under the Trump administration caused at least US$200 billion worth of economic damage to Iran; he condemned such sanctions as inhumane, a crime and an act of terrorism.◆Between 1980 and 1992, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on Libya, and from 1992 to 2003, it rallied or coerced allies into expanding sanctions against Libya. The World Bank noted that Libya suffered up to US$18 billion economic losses as a result of the sanctions, while an official Libyan estimate put the figure at 33 billion.◆Crude U.S. sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf War brought about serious consequences. From August 1990 to May 2003, they caused a total loss of US$150 billion in Iraq´s oil revenue. As a result, the country´s per capita income falls below its 1990 level of US$7,050 even to this day. The sanctions have also caused a serious humanitarian disaster, with infant mortality rate doubling and the under-five mortality increasing six-fold. Meanwhile, Iraq´s education, health and social security systems were destroyed; its literacy rate fell from 89 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 1997.◆Undermining the purposes and functions of various international governance mechanisms. The United States has frequently imposed unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce and other agencies imposed various sanctions on as many as over 2,000 entities. As a result, the sanctioning function of the Security Council is undercut, seriously affecting its normal function of maintaining international peace and security. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) attempted to investigate suspected war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the United States, with itself not being a member of the Court, responded by launching sanctions against ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and senior official Phakiso Mochochoko, sparking unanimous outcry from the international community. Despite the ruling of the Dispute Settlement Body of WTO that its Section 301 procedures are a violation of international law, the United States continues to launch various unilateral Section 301 investigations on imports from China and other countries, and keeps all existing Section 301 tariffs unchanged. Such actions have directly sabotaged the tariff concessions achieved by many rounds of difficult negotiations of the multilateral trading system, blatantly trampled on the purposes and spirit of the multilateral trading system, and eroded the cornerstone of the system´s operation.◆Undermining the interests of companies of other countries. To maintain its economic and technological supremacy, the United States abuses its public power to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition. Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and fighting against human rights violations, it has adopted a package of measures including the Entity List and economic sanctions to restrict foreign enterprises from obtaining raw materials, items and technologies vital to their survival and development, sometimes even used secondary sanctions to cut those companies' normal trade with enterprises from other countries in an effort to disrupt their supply chains root and branch.◆A case in point is the imprisonment of a senior manager from the French company Alstom. In 2013, in order to beat Alstom in their business competition, the United States applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to arrest and detain Frédéric Pierucci on charges of bribing foreign officials. He was further induced to sign a plea deal and provide more evidence and information against his company, leaving Alstom no choice but to accept General Electric´s acquisition, vanishing ever since from the Fortune 500 list. The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has become a tool for its public power to suppress competitors and meddle in normal international business activities, announcing the United States’ complete departure from its long-standing self-proclaimed champion of liberal market economy.◆In recent years, the United States has frequently employed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (2016) to impose unilateral sanctions on entities in various countries deemed to have engaged in ""serious human rights violations."" However, while exercising such unilateral sanctions, the United States has often violated the basic human rights of the sanctioned subjects disregarding the fact that their human rights are also entitled to protection.◆When COVID-19 was raging in the world, the U.S. government did not relent in imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran, Syria and other countries, making it difficult for these countries to obtain the much-needed medical supplies to fight the virus. As a result of the sanctions, Iran has been cut off access to essential medicines and medical equipment, putting the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy. To raise funds to fight the pandemic, the Iranian government applied to the IMF for a US$5 billion dollar exclusive loan, but the effort was blocked by the United States. Even worse, the United States prevented Iran from importing COVID vaccines by freezing its overseas funds and threatening vaccine suppliers. As the Brookings Institution estimated, during the height of the pandemic in Iran, U.S. sanctions further exacerbated the spread of the virus and could have caused up to 13,000 of deaths.ConclusionThe U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is not something new. In spite of adaptations over time in its contents and measures, the nature of the U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has not changed: it has been, since the very beginning, a hegemonic tool to maintain U.S. hegemony, suppress foreign competitors, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and even subvert the governments of other countries. Over the last few years, the United States has abused long-arm jurisdiction by continuing to lower the threshold and intensifying measures to an unprecedented degree against wider range of targets. It not only undermines the principle of sovereign equality, violates international law, and erodes the multilateral order with the UN at its core, but also creates and intensifies tensions and conflicts among major countries, and poses a threat to the international security system established after World War II. It also interferes with and distorts normal international commercial exchanges and trade order, disrupts the supply chain of global trade, damages the interests of enterprises and raises their operating costs. The United States should renounce its illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction measures, and truly take up its international responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0203/c90000-10203300.html,3,2,2023,"['jurisdiction', 'long', 'arm', 'united', 'states', 'sanctions', 'international', 'countries', 'economic', 'act', 'entities', 'foreign', 'unilateral', 'iran', 'law', 'practice', 'state', 'extraterritorial', 'normal', 'security']",0.3546131490635801,-0.017414822964391924,3/2/2023

Interview: China women's basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China women´s basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics (Xinhua) 13:33, March 09, 2023BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Making the move from player to head coach in women´s basketball is no easy feat, to say nothing of making it to the final of a World Cup as both a player and a head coach.So Zheng Wei has many reasons to be proud of herself.The current head coach of China´s women´s basketball team steered her squad to second place at the FIBA Women´s World Cup last year, tying the country´s best record in the tournament. She was also part of the China team which reached the final of the World Championships in 1994.In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Zheng told her story of getting over regrets during a career spanning 28 years.UNFORGETTABLE FIBA 2022 WORLD CUPDuring the last Olympic cycle, China were widely considered serious medal contenders at major world competitions, but failed to prove their prowess at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.""In Tokyo, we were rallied past and eliminated by Serbia,"" Zheng recalled.What made the year 2021 even more poignant for Zheng´s team was that they were defeated by Japan in the Asian Cup final.""Because of these setbacks my players really wanted to move a step forward and reach a new level,"" said Zheng.For Zheng, the underperformance was somehow reminiscent of the 1994 World Championships, where China missed out on the title after losing to Brazil in the final.""It was the closest China´s women´s basketball team had ever come to winning the world title. We defeated Australia to set up a final showdown with Brazil,"" said Zheng.""We had never lost to Brazil in previous games, so we felt like we were already the world champions.""But because we were mentally unprepared and too eager for success, we didn't play our best in that game and left with regrets,"" she added.28 years later, Zheng made up for her regrets, even though the young China side she coached also finished runners-up at the World Cup after losing to the United States in the final.Speaking of last year´s World Cup journey, Zheng mentioned the quarterfinal against France and the semifinal against Australia as the two most unforgettable games, as the former represented a breakthrough for the team, while the latter showcased her players' tenacity and resilience.""It was the best game that France played throughout the World Cup. Their shooting percentage was very high, and it was tough,"" said Zheng.""But our players had prepared for that moment for years. Everyone held their breath and didn't want to leave with regrets.""After breaking through this barrier, the players became more confident,"" she added.In the match against hosts Australia, China withstood pressure even though they were playing without top scorer Li Meng.""When the opportunity came, everyone´s determination to move forward did not change. Although Li Meng did not play, everyone else stepped up and took responsibility,"" Zheng noted.""I think it was willpower that helped us. Australia were a more experienced team, but by the fourth quarter, they couldn't keep up with us.""From the group stage to the final, Zheng´s players kept surprising her with fantastic performances. ""Maybe after breaking through that window, they couldn't be stopped. They did their best to present both technique and spirit on the court. I think there was no regret this time,"" said Zheng.CHINA MOVING TO THE TOPBasking in World Cup glory, Zheng urged her players to stay calm and work harder.""We only made it to the final in this tournament. It might come just by chance,"" said Zheng.""But if we are a genuinely top team like the USA, Australia, France and Spain, we need to prove ourselves in every competition.""A lack of experience is China´s biggest weakness, which often led to inconsistent play in the knockout stages, said Zheng.To change the situation, she stressed the importance of building up a more competitive professional league in China and scheduling more high-quality international friendlies for the national team.Zheng summarized the trend of women´s basketball as ""a more physical game with more vaguely defined positions, fiercer defense, more intensive body contact and better individual techniques.""""I believe we are approaching our goals on the right track through training,"" she said.TEAMWORK IS CHINA'S TRADITIONHaving served as an assistant coach of China´s national team for 12 years before taking charge as the head coach, Zheng is deeply impressed by the team´s tradition of teamwork.""Unity, cooperation, selfless dedication, and never giving up are the glorious traditions of China´s women´s basketball team,"" Zheng said.""Shao Ting and Sun Mengran have passed them on to Yang Liwei and Li Meng, and the latter are passing onto the next generation.""Zheng said that she also had good cooperation with her predecessors and learned a lot from them.""I had been analyzing opponents' strategies for the team before, so I am very familiar with both our players and our main opponents. What I can do is bring out the players' strength and make them more confident,"" she said.BALANCING PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL TEAMThe 2022-2023 WCBA league season is set to conclude in mid-March. Zheng confirmed that the national team will assemble at the end of March to begin preparations for this year´s two main events - the Asian Cup and the Asian Games.""We will play the Asian Cup in June, but some of the players who were in last year´s World Cup may not join the team because they have contracts with WNBA teams, so the mission will be tough for us,"" Zheng said.According to Zheng, four or five players, including center Han Xu and veteran Yang Liwei, have contacts with the WNBA. Zheng said she hopes that they can refine themselves in a more competitive league and return to perform better for the national team.Zheng revealed that the Asian Cup and the Asian Games are China´s short-term goal, while their long-term goal is the Paris Olympics in 2024.""We need to combine our preparations with the two goals,"" she said.""We may recruit more young players who can compete in international events. They are eager to play for the national team. We want to observe them and help them grow.""We hope to add one backup to every position. The national team´s roster will include 16 to 18 players this time.""Asked about their prospects at Paris 2024, Zheng said: ""We aim to match our World Cup performance in every major competition in the future. Hopefully we can achieve it.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219392.html,9,3,2023,"['zheng', 'team', 'china', 'cup', 'players', 'final', 'women', 'national', 'basketball', 'coach', 'asian', 'australia', 'play', 'head', 'regrets', 'years', 'games', 'high', 'paris', 'olympics']",0.41474471361971366,0.17011025779775782,9/3/2023

Leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador boycotted the meeting, Uruguay´s president said he had contracted COVID-19, and Bolivia also declined to attend.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a key Latin American leader on the summit´s guest list, announced Monday morning that he would stay at home.""There cannot be a Summit of the Americas if all countries of the Americas cannot attend,"" Lopez Obrador said at his daily press conference in Mexico City. ""This is to continue the old interventionist policies, of lack of respect for nations and their people.""These notable absences triggered outcries from the media, which described it as a disaster and embarrassment for U.S. diplomacy.CNN said in a story published Wednesday that the absences of the leaders were notable ""since the United States has worked to cultivate those leaders as partners on immigration, an issue that looms as a political liability for Biden.""A video screenshot shows a poster of the 9th Summit of the Americas at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, California, the United States, June 9, 2022.

The summit belongs to all of the Americas,"" Briceno said in his speech, when Biden sat only a few meters away. ""It is therefore inexcusable that all countries of the Americas are not here, and the power of the summit diminished by their absence.""Briceno said the exclusionary summit was incomprehensible, especially when ""Cuba has provided consistent, unmatched cooperation in health to almost two-thirds of the countries in this hemisphere"" and ""Venezuela has done so much toward energy security for the Caribbean region.""""The time has come, Mr. President, to lift the blockade and to build bonds of friendship with the people of Cuba.

Calling Hersh´s report something that should not be glossed over, more people around the world now demand an objective, fair and professional probe into the incident, and a speedup in truth-telling.NEEDLE OF SUSPICIONOn Sept. 26, 2022, a series of clandestine bombings and subsequent underwater gas leaks occurred on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, which carry gas from Russia to Europe. Soon afterwards, Washington and some European countries pointed an accusing finger at Russia.This file photo provided by the Swedish Coast Guard on Sept. 28, 2022 shows a gas leak on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. (The Swedish Coast Guard/Handout via Xinhua)But independent thinkers have reckoned the other way around. Days after the blasts, Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, told Bloomberg in a TV show that the United States, rather than Russia, could be behind the attack, leading TV hosts to abruptly taking him off the air.Hersh´s account on Feb. 8 adds weight to Sachs' assertions. In a 5,200-word article published on the U.S. portal Substack, Hersh revealed how the United States partnered with Norway in a top-secret operation in June 2022 to plant remotely triggered explosives that took out three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later.In response, Washington has denied the accusation on various occasions. Speaking to Fox News on Feb. 19, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby called Hersh´s report ""a completely false story.""However, not everyone bought Washington´s version. In an emailed interview with Xinhua, Sachs perceived Hersh´s report as ""credible"" and consistent with several existing facts.Former U.S. National Security Agency employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden tweeted earlier this month that the United States is wasting time and money to shoot down ""unidentified flying objects"" above U.S. and Canadian soil to ensure that national security reporters get assigned to investigate balloon nonsense ""rather than (U.S.) budgets or bombings (of Nord Stream).""""The U.S. had the motive, means, and opportunity and spent many months confessing to the plot and then to the crime after it took place,"" noted the Black Agenda Report website, citing U.S. President Joe Biden´s pledge in February 2022 to stop the Nord Stream 2 project and U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland´s remarks in January this year that Washington is ""gratified"" to know the Nord Stream 2 is now ""a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea.""There are ""ample reasons"" why the United States would be involved in the Nord Stream blasts, Sevim Dagdelen, a parliamentarian of Germany´s Left Party, was quoted as saying by Canadian website Western Standard in a report published on Feb. 13.""Many European capitals put the finger against Russia and said, 'it was Russia that blew up its own pipeline,' which was nonsense,"" former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl told Sputnik in an interview. ""For me, one thing was clear ever since 2018 that the U.S. was very much determined to make sure that this pipeline system would never ever become operative.""The now-deleted ""Thank you, USA"" tweet posted by former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski offered fresh insight into how much some European officials are convinced of U.S. culpability.COLLECTIVE SILENCEWhen the needle of suspicion points towards the United States, European governments have fallen into collective silence.Denmark, Germany and Sweden are investigating the destruction, but all remain tight-lipped over who blew holes in the pipelines.Last week, the three countries told the UN Security Council in a joint letter that investigations are ""ongoing."" Nothing was said about who is responsible. They only stated that ""investigations have not yet been concluded"" and ""it is not possible to say when they will be concluded.""Not even allowing access to members of the German Bundestag, all information on the matter has been classified as ""highly confidential"" because of the so-called third-party rule that prevents conflicts with the interests of allied states or their intelligence services.""Even if the Germans, Swedes or Danes themselves found some evidence of U.S. involvement in the explosions, they would hardly talk about them because they would not be able to take such responsibility,"" said Igor Yushkov, a leading analyst of Russia´s National Energy Security Fund.Besides, U.S. corporate media have overwhelmingly brushed aside Hersh´s report. A study by independent watchdog journalism MintPress News analyzed the 20 most influential publications in the United States, and found only four mentions of the report.""What´s most strange in this case is that U.S. mainstream media with political and social influence, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, have deliberately remained indifferent and silent when Hersh, a veteran journalist who has proved his credibility in his investigations in the past, published his latest investigation of the Nord Stream blasts,"" wrote Singapore´s Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao on Feb. 11.""When we see this kind of thing (the Nord Stream blasts) going on, we go to somebody who might be able to protect us and might be able to get the word out. Now, this was two weeks ago. Has The New York Times mentioned Seymour Hersh´s article? Or has it even reported the denials? No, not yet. This is quite (as what) the Germans would say, merkwurdig (strange),"" former CIA analyst Ray McGovern addressed the UN Security Council recently.This file photo released by the Danish Ministry of Defense on Sept. 27, 2022 shows a Nord Stream gas pipeline leak site. (Danish Defense Ministry/Handout via Xinhua)WHO BENEFITS MOST?A recent report by Indian news website Firstpost quoted Hersh as saying that the United States saw energy alternatives for Europe as a ""threat,"" and the Biden administration feared that Europe would ""walk away"" from the Ukraine crisis if it felt the need for Russian fuel carried by the pipeline, which was under sanctions.""The fear of losing European support in the Ukraine conflict made the U.S. to take out the only option Europe had should it want to restart buying fuel from Russia,"" Hersh argued.Just like Hersh, many others believing in U.S. sabotage also noted its strategic and economic motives behind the scenes.""The U.S. did not like the close economic relations between Germany and Russia. They are doing something or they could try to do something that could break these relations,"" Gunnar Beck, a member of the European Parliament, said in an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia on Feb. 12.Washington was guided by strategic reasons to close Russia´s energy and economic ties with Germany and most countries in Western and Eastern Europe, Beck said.From the political and economic perspective, the United States is the major beneficiary of the incident, former Advisor to the French Defense Ministry Alain Corvez told the China Global Television Network on Feb. 14.Italian journalist Gilberto Trombetta also said that Hersh´s report is credible because the only one who would certainly benefit from the blasts is the United States.Hersh´s disclosure is ""not impossible"" because the United States has benefited the most from the incident as it can sell gas to Europe at a much higher price, in addition to exerting pressure on Russia, Croatian security expert Mirko Vukobratovic told Xinhua on Feb. 21.Meanwhile, calls for a thorough probe into the incident to restore truth have mounted across the world. For example, Sachs told the UN Security Council in a briefing on Feb. 21 that an investigation by the Security Council into the explosions is a high global priority.Noting the Nord Stream pipelines are major transboundary infrastructure and energy transportation arteries, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Wednesday that China supports speeding up the investigation into the blasts to swiftly find out the truth.Applauding China´s call, Vukobratovic said: ""The Chinese position that the investigation must be objective and impartial is the only correct one. Only when it is carried out professionally can we talk about the intentions of those who caused the explosion.""In her tweet on Wednesday, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary A. DiCarlo also stressed the importance of ""search for the truth"" regarding the matter.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0301/c90000-10214166.html,1,3,2023,"['nord', 'stream', 'hersh', 'report', 'states', 'russia', 'united', 'feb', 'security', 'blasts', 'washington', 'europe', 'european', 'gas', 'pipeline', 'council', 'incident', 'truth', 'pipelines', 'sachs']",0.3523448134952559,0.08822823685655545,1/3/2023
Commentary: No rules for USA - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: No rules for USA (Xinhua) 16:22, August 26, 2022BEIJING, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Some U.S. politicians keep preaching ""upholding the rules-based international order."" But in reality, the country proves to be the biggest destroyer of rules and order, and their repeated reference means nothing but their preference for U.S. hegemony.As a founding member of the United Nations and the world´s only superpower, the United States constantly places its domestic law above international law and observes international rules only as it sees fit. This is the biggest damage being done to the international order.While asking other countries to uphold the international order, the United States has been obstructing negotiations for a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention, and refusing to ratify multiple international conventions including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.The United States has withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Council, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other organizations, even the Trans-Pacific Partnership it had advocated.The United States' so-called ""rules-based international order"" is actually a bunch of rules made by a handful of countries to serve the selfish interests of the United States in seeking hegemony.John Bolton, former White House national security adviser, said earlier in an interview unashamedly that he had helped plan coups in foreign countries. Bolton´s admission is so revealing.Leading U.S. politicians trumpet the so-called ""rules-based international order"" for one purpose: to ensure that the United States can easily interfere in other countries' affairs and overthrow their governments at its own will. This is exactly the kind of ""rules"" and ""order"" that they want to defend.For years, the United States has created political unrest in Latin America, played a part in the ""Arab Spring"", and instigated color revolutions in Europe and Asia. The United States has wantonly invaded and interfered militarily in other countries, killing over 800,000 people and turning more than 20 million into refugees in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Afghanistan. The United States says little, however, about how many innocent lives have been lost and how many families torn apart as a steep price for this order it championed.The Taiwan question has always been the most important and the most sensitive issue at the heart of China-U.S. relations. The China-U.S. Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, published in December 1978, states: ""The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.""However, the United States has substantially eased restrictions on official relations with Taiwan and increased military contacts with the region, as evidenced by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi´s visit to Taiwan earlier this month. The United States' deviation from the one-China principle will surely take a huge toll on the mutual trust between the two countries.The one-China principle, reaffirmed by United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758, is an integral part of the post-WWII international order, an established international consensus and a widely-accepted basic norm in international relations.By breaching the one-China principle, the United States is also challenging the post-war international order, which will surely be met with wide opposition from the international community.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed in June that they've sought to build an imperfect but liberal order. But judging from the U.S. deeds, it is neither liberal nor order; it is hegemony, highhandedness and bullying, and an attempt of the United States and a small number of other countries to make rules that suit themselves.People across the world will not want the kind of ""imperfect"" but ""liberal"" order peddled by the United States. What they want is an equal and shared right to security, development and prosperity for all. It is high time that the United States reflects on itself and takes real responsibilities for world peace and development. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0826/c90000-10140348.html,26,8,2022,"['united', 'states', 'international', 'order', 'rules', 'countries', 'china', 'taiwan', 'relations', 'based', 'hegemony', 'nations', 'part', 'principle', 'liberal', 'politicians', 'biggest', 'law', 'convention', 'rights']",0.37568422318422307,0.10972041847041847,26/8/2022

Some Facts About Pelosi's Visit to Taiwan - People's Daily Online,"Some Facts About Pelosi´s Visit to Taiwan (Xinhua) 08:09, August 25, 2022BEIJING, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Some Facts About Pelosi´s Visit to TaiwanIntroductionSpeaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi made a provocative visit to China´s Taiwan region recently in disregard of the Chinese side´s stern warnings. The visit seriously infringes on China´s sovereignty and security, seriously undermines China´s territorial integrity, seriously jeopardizes peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and seriously erodes the political foundation of China-US relations. The Chinese side has been compelled to take countermeasures. The US side has been pushing disinformation to confuse right and wrong and confound black and white, criticizing China´s legitimate countermeasures and trying to mislead the world about the Taiwan question. It is necessary to set the record straight with facts and lay bare the US´s hegemonic nature and gangster logic.Fact No. 1: The one-China principle is the political foundation of China-US relations. The meaning of this principle is clear and accurate. There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People´s Republic of China (PRC) is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This is the original meaning of one China, and a universal consensus of the international community. The United States, while claiming to uphold the one-China policy, is in effect using the “salami tactic” to distort, falsify, obscure and hollow out the one-China principle.Taiwan has belonged to China since ancient times. This claim has a sound basis in history and jurisprudence.A large number of historical records and annals document the development of Taiwan by the Chinese people in earlier periods. The earliest references are to be found in 230 A.D. during the Three Kingdoms Period. Starting from the Song and Yuan dynasties, central governments of China had set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Penghu and Taiwan. After mid-16th century during the Ming dynasty, official documents began to use the name Taiwan formally. In 1624, Dutch colonialists invaded and occupied the southern part of Taiwan. In 1662, national hero Zheng Chenggong led an expedition to expel the Dutch occupiers and recover Taiwan. Subsequently, the government of the Qing dynasty increased its administrative bodies in Taiwan gradually. In 1684, a Taiwan prefecture administration was set up under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. In 1885, Taiwan was turned into a full province.In July 1894, Japan launched a war of aggression against China known as the First Sino-Japanese War. In April 1895, the defeated Qing government was forced to cede Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan. During the Chinese People´s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the Communist Party of China (CPC) made clear propositions for the recovery of Taiwan. During a conversation with US journalist Nym Wales on 15 May 1937, Comrade Mao Zedong said that China´s goal was to achieve a final victory in the war — a victory that would not only recover the occupied Chinese territories in Northeast China and to the south of the Shanhai Pass, but also secure the liberation of Taiwan.On 1 December 1943, China, the United States and the United Kingdom issued the Cairo Declaration, stating that it was the purpose of the three allies that all the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Northeast China, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be restored to China. On 26 July 1945, China, the United States and the United Kingdom signed the Potsdam Proclamation, subsequently joined by the Soviet Union. It reiterated that “The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.” In September 1945, Japan signed the instrument of surrender, in which it promised that it would faithfully fulfill the obligations laid down in the Potsdam Proclamation. On 25 October, the Chinese government announced that it was resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan, and the ceremony to accept Japan´s surrender in Taiwan Province of the China war theater of the Allied powers was held in Taipei. From that point forward, China had recovered Taiwan de jure and de facto through a host of documents with international legal effect.On 1 October 1949, the Central People´s Government of the PRC was founded, replacing the government of the Republic of China to become the only legitimate government representing the whole of China. The new government replaced the previous one in a situation where China, as a subject under international law, did not change and China´s sovereignty and inherent territory did not change. As a result, the government of the PRC should naturally enjoy and exercise China´s full sovereignty, which includes its sovereignty over Taiwan. As a result of the civil war in China and the interference of external forces, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have fallen into a state of protracted political confrontation. But the sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided and will never be allowed to be divided, and Taiwan´s status as part of China´s territory has never changed and will never be allowed to change.Resolution 2758 of the United Nations General Assembly established the one-China principle that was widely observed by the international community.At its 26th session in October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, which undertook “to restore all its rights to the People´s Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it”. This resolution settled once and for all the political, legal and procedural issues of the representation of the whole of China, Taiwan included, in the United Nations. It also made it clear that there is but one seat of China in the United Nations, and there is no such thing as “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”. The specialized agencies of the United Nations later adopted further resolutions to restore to the PRC its lawful seat and expel the representatives of the Taiwan authorities.It was clearly stated in the official legal opinions of the UN Secretariat that “the United Nations considers ‘Taiwan' as a province of China with no separate status”, and the “‘authorities' in ‘Taipei' are not considered to... enjoy any form of government status”. In practice, Taiwan is referred to at the United Nations as “Taiwan, Province of China”.Upholding the one-China principle is a political commitment made by the United States. It is also the prerequisite and basis for the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations.In the Shanghai Communiqu in 1972, the United States expresses clearly that “The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position.”In the Joint Communiqu on the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1978, the United States expresses clearly that “The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People´s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. Within this context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.”In the Joint Communiqu on 17 August 1982, the United States expresses clearly that “In the Joint Communiqu on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations on January 1, 1979 issued by the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People´s Republic of China, the United States of America recognized the Government of the People´s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, and it acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The United States Government has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China´s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of ‘two Chinas' or ‘one China, one Taiwan'.”The United States keeps challenging the one-China principle through disinformation and misinformation activities.According to international law, the United States should honor its commitments with goodwill and good faith. It cannot refuse to perform its commitments or obligations under international law by citing its domestic legal provisions, or unilaterally distort China-US joint communiqus based on its after-the-fact, secret assurances. However, after the George W. Bush administration took office in 2001, the United States put its own Taiwan Relations Act before the three joint communiqus. The Trump administration, in the latter half of its term, blatantly inserted the Six Assurances to Taiwan, something it had long kept secret, in its formulation of the one-China policy. The US side deleted key statements such as “Taiwan is part of China” from its State Department website. After Pelosi´s visit to Taiwan, the United States, together with its allies, issued a so-called statement that attempts to designate situations where the one-China policy is “applicable” and leaves room for arbitrary interpretation.In recent years, the United States has neglected the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation and other international legal documents, falsely claimed that Resolution 2758 did not conclusively resolve the issue of Taiwan´s representation, and played up the illegal and invalid Treaty of San Francisco. It has professed that the status of Taiwan has yet to be determined, and declared its support for “Taiwan´s meaningful participation in the UN system”. The attempt of the United States is to change Taiwan´s status as part of China, create “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”, and achieve its political purpose of using Taiwan to contain China.What the United States has done goes against its own political commitments, seriously violates the doctrine of estoppel under international law, and runs counter to basic principles of international law established by the UN Charter such as sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference. These acts are clearly illegal in nature.Fact No. 2: The US Congress is part of the US government. Congress members' visits to Taiwan run counter to the US political commitment of maintaining only unofficial relations with Taiwan, and violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqus. The US government is responsible for making sure its political commitments to China are honored and executed by all parts of government.The United States, as one country, must have one foreign policy only. As part of the US government, the Congress has the responsibility to deliver on the US government´s commitments to other countries. It must strictly observe the one-China policy and refrain from any official exchanges with China´s Taiwan region. Under neither international law nor US domestic legislation does “separation of powers” give the US the excuse to defy international obligations and take actions that go against the basic norms governing international relations, provoke against China´s sovereignty, and break its own commitment on the Taiwan question.Pelosi´s visit is a blatant violation of the US commitment of “not developing official relations with Taiwan”. As the House Speaker, Pelosi is the number three figure in the US government and second in line, after the Vice President, to succeed the US President. She traveled on a government jet provided by the US military, and was received with high-profile protocol by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities of Taiwan. During her stay in Taiwan, Pelosi talked about representing the US on all occasions, and claimed that “America stands with Taiwan”. A press statement called it the first official visit by a US House Speaker to Taiwan in 25 years. And the DPP authorities have been touting Pelosi´s visit as a major breakthrough in Taiwan-US relations.Past mistakes shall not serve as an excuse for more wrongdoings, still less can they justify today´s mistakes. Former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich´s visit to the Taiwan region in 1997 was itself a mistake, and the Chinese side has all along firmly opposed it. The US should not use Gingrich´s mistake to gloss over Pelosi´s unlawful visit to Taiwan, still less should it create new excuses for further elevating official contact with Taiwan in the future.Fact No. 3: Pelosi´s visit to Taiwan has nothing to do with democracy. Rather, it is a political stunt and serious provocation that infringes upon China´s sovereignty and territorial integrity, goes against the will of the over 1.4 billion Chinese people, and challenges the international consensus on one-China.Under the disguise of “democracy”, Pelosi intentionally distorts the nature of the Taiwan question, which is purely China´s internal affair, and attempts to negate the justification and legitimacy of the Chinese government´s efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is a blatant practice of political manipulation with the aim of infringing upon China´s sovereignty, undermining China´s stability and containing China´s development.By creating the so-called “democracy vs. authoritarianism” narrative on the international stage, the US is clinging to the wrong mindsets of Cold War mentality and zero-sum thinking. It is using ideology and values as a tool to advance its geopolitical strategy, and employing every possible means to preserve US hegemony and western centrism.American democracy has deviated from the essence of democracy. The American-style democracy is a game of money played by the rich. Ninety-one percent of US Congressional elections are won by better-financed candidates. “One person one vote” in name, “rule of the minority elite” in fact. Ordinary voters are wooed when their votes are wanted but pushed aside once the election is over. The checks and balances have resulted in a “vetocracy”, putting partisan interests before the need of national development. The US electoral system is visibly flawed. The practice of gerrymandering, which draws the boundaries of electoral districts by manipulation, undermines fairness and justice. American democracy is fraught with deep-seated problems. Problems like money politics, identity politics, partisan wrangling, political polarization, social division, racial tension and wealth gap have become more acute. The Capitol riot shocked the world. The death of George Floyd triggered waves of protests. The mishandling of COVID-19 resulted in a human tragedy. The problem of “the rich get richer, and the poor poorer” is worsening. The dysfunction and failure of American-style democracy have become an unmistakable fact.As multiple opinion polls conducted by the Pew Research Center and other pollsters show, the people of the world, including the American people, hold a negative view about the state of democracy in the US. US Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Greene has tweeted, Pelosi is “not staying in America and solving problems afflicting our people” and she is “obsessed with her own power she´s held for decades while our entire country crumbles ... enough with this fake ‘courage' defending democracy.”Over the years, the US has, under the pretext of democracy, willfully meddled in the internal affairs of developing countries and waged military intervention and aggression. It is the biggest threat to regional and international security. Since 2001, the wars and military operations launched by the US in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria in the name of democracy have resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of injuries, left tens of millions displaced, and caused humanitarian disasters in several countries. Under the pretext of so-called “democratic values”, the US has wantonly intervened in other countries' internal affairs and even instigated regime change and propped up pro-US governments. The US has implemented the new Monroe Doctrine in Latin America, incited color revolutions in the Eurasian region, and orchestrated the Arab Spring in West Asia and North Africa, bringing disorder and calamity to the countries concerned and seriously undermining world peace, stability and development. To this day, the US still tries to divide the world into “democracies” and “non-democracies” by its standards and blatantly stokes division and confrontation. Such acts will only bring even greater turmoil and disaster to the international community.Fact No. 4: It is the US and the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces that are changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and stoking crisis.The real status quo of the Taiwan Strait is this: there is only one China in the world; Taiwan is a part of China; and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. The two sides across the Taiwan Strait belong to the one and same China. The sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided.The DPP authorities are inflicting change on the status quo of the Taiwan Strait: they stick to their separatist agenda for “Taiwan independence” and continue to make provocations. They incorporate “pursuing independence” into their party platform. They refuse to recognize the one-China principle, assert that Taiwan and the mainland should not be subordinate to each other, and proclaim a new “two states” theory. In Taiwan, they constantly press for “de-sinicization” and promote “incremental independence”. They incite radical separatists in and outside the DPP to lobby for amendments to their “constitution” and “laws”. They deceive the people of Taiwan, incite hostility against the mainland, and hinder the exchanges, cooperation and interconnected development across the Strait. They have steadily built up military forces in pursuit of “independence” and to obstruct reunification. They co-opt external forces to sow the seeds of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”, going further down the path of seeking “Taiwan independence”.The US is changing the status quo of the Taiwan Strait by playing the “Taiwan card” to contain China, and supporting and conniving at “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.The United States, betraying its pledge to maintain only unofficial relations with Taiwan, keeps raising the level of engagement with Taiwan, as evidenced by the successive visits or interactions by its Health and Human Services Secretary, Under Secretary of State and other senior officials, as well as the members of the US Congress and its diplomatic envoys. In January 2021, then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the lift of restrictions on its officials’ contacts with Taiwan. In April 2021, the US Department of State issued new guidelines to encourage engagement between the US officials with their so-called “Taiwan counterparts”. The visit by Pelosi, ranked the third in the US government, to the Taiwan region has substantially upgraded US official interactions with Taiwan.In violation of its promise to gradually reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution, the US continues to increase its arms sales to Taiwan, emboldening the “Taiwan independence” separatist activities. Despite “severing” its diplomatic relations with Taiwan authorities in 1979, the US has upgraded non-stop the scale and performance of weaponry sold to Taiwan. Over the past 43 years, it has sold more than 70 billion US dollars worth of arms to Taiwan. The Trump administration alone conducted arms sales to Taiwan 11 times in four years, nearing 20 billion US dollars. The incumbent administration has approved arms sales to Taiwan five times, covering advanced equipment such as the Patriot missile defense system, self-propelled artillery, and ammunition supply vehicle.The US has continued to challenge the consensus of the international community by claiming that the status of Taiwan is yet to be determined. It keeps helping Taiwan expand its so-called international space. The US clamored for Taiwan’s participation as an observer to the 75th World Health Assembly. It alleged that each country should be able to determine the contours of its own “one China” policy and encourages countries with “diplomatic relations” with Taiwan to maintain or even strengthen such relations. It must be pointed out that China’s Taiwan region’s participation in the activities of international organizations can only be handled in accordance with the one-China principle. This is an important principle enshrined in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and an international consensus that should not be manipulated.The US has been criticized by many at home for its position on the Taiwan question. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in May 2022, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger underscored the imperative to keep to the one-China principle, and warned the United States against developing “something of a two-China solution” by subterfuge or a gradual process. Thomas Friedman, a seasoned American journalist and New York Times columnist, noted in an article on 1 August 2022 that if Pelosi goes ahead with a Taiwan visit, she will be doing something “utterly reckless, dangerous and irresponsible”, of which nothing good will come, and “Taiwan will not be more secure or more prosperous as a result of this purely symbolic visit.”The one-China principle clearly defines the status quo of the Taiwan Strait. Any attempt to breach or challenge this principle is to change the status quo. The Chinese people have the firm resolve, strong will and enormous capability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China will work with the international community to resolutely uphold the one-China principle, and break the illusion of the DPP authorities to seek US support for their independence agenda. Any attempt to use Taiwan to contain China will be thwarted.Fact No. 5: It is the US that initiated and planned Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. All the ins and outs are crystal clear. Who is right and who is wrong is self-evident. The US and Taiwan have colluded and provoked first, and China is only taking legitimate countermeasures for self-defense. China’s countermeasures are firm, effective, proportionate and in line with China’s domestic law, international law and customary international practice.Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is a serious violation of the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqus. It endangers China’s core interests, and creates tensions, stokes confrontation and instigates division in the region. Facing the provocative behavior of the US, China has made serious representations multiple times. Despite China’s repeated warnings, the US chose to go ahead with the visit. It is perfectly justified for China to take resolute countermeasures.China has made utmost diplomatic efforts to avoid this crisis that is initiated by the US and imposed on China. Over the past four months, the Chinese side has made clear to the US side, once and again, through multiple channels and at various levels, its solemn position that China resolutely opposes the US House Speaker’s visit to Taiwan. China pointed out that this provocative US move would trigger a crisis and that China would not sit idly by. We urged the US side to avoid any illusions and misjudgments, and warned that all the consequences arising from the visit shall be entirely borne by the US side.All the countermeasures taken by the Chinese government in response to Pelosi’s visit are what China is fully entitled to do to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. They are necessary and timely defensive countermeasures aimed at safeguarding China’s sovereignty and security, and stopping the US and the “Taiwan independence” forces from going further down the wrong and dangerous path. The relevant measures are a warning to the provocateurs and an effort to safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait and stability in the region.China’s resolute countermeasures against Pelosi’s visit are not only a necessary move to safeguard its own sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also a legitimate action to safeguard the basic norms of international relations and the international order established after the Second World War. The one-China principle has been recognized by the United Nations and the vast majority of countries. It has become a widely recognized basic norm governing international relations and is part and parcel of the post-war international order. By firmly upholding the one-China principle and resolutely opposing the practice of obscuring and hollowing out the one-China principle, China is unequivocally upholding the basic principles of international law, including non-interference in internal affairs and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.If China took no countermeasure against the US actions that interfere in the internal affairs and undermine the sovereignty of another country, and failed to resolutely resist the reckless and irresponsible US moves, the purposes of the UN Charter and basic norms governing international relations including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity would be reduced to empty words. Any member of the developing world that accounts for 80 percent of the world’s population may become the next target at any time. By firmly rejecting the US provocations on the Taiwan question, China is saying no to the US hegemony and bullying, and upholding international fairness and justice.According to international law, all countries are obligated to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries and not to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs. Every country is entitled to take necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and stop external interference.Fact No. 6: It is legitimate and lawful for the Chinese military to conduct military exercises and training in the waters near China’s Taiwan Island. The US move to use Taiwan to contain China is the root cause of troubles that undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and even the world.Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The military exercises and training by the Chinese side in the waters near China’s Taiwan Island were conducted in an open, transparent and professional manner. The Chinese side has issued safety reminders and navigational warnings in advance. China’s activities fully comply with its domestic law, international law and customary international practice.The normal military exercises and training by the Chinese military in the waters near China’s Taiwan Island are aimed at safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, deterring the US attempt to use Taiwan to contain China, shattering the Taiwan authorities’ fantasy of seeking US support for “Taiwan independence”, and maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait and stability in the region.It is the US that has exacerbated tensions in the Taiwan Strait. The US has been flexing its muscles and provoking troubles at will in waters near China. The US National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 proposed to “continue regular transits of US Navy vessels through the Taiwan Strait”, and “encourage allies and partners to follow suit in conducting such transits”.The US has so far sold weapons and equipment worth tens of billions of dollars to Taiwan and clamored to help Taiwan enhance its “asymmetrical warfare” capability. A senior US Department of Defense official claimed that the US could use Taiwan as a strategic fulcrum of the first island chain and threatened to block China’s reunification process. In the “Indo-Pacific Strategy” released in February 2022, the US claimed that it will support Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, thus introducing the Taiwan question into its regional strategy. This is an attempt to play geopolitical games, exaggerate tension and provoke confrontation, which fully exposes its sinister intention to undermine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific.It is also the US that threatens world peace and stability. The US has launched military operations around the world, wreaking havoc on innocent civilians. Throughout the 240-plus years of US history, there were only 16 years in which the US was not at war. According to incomplete statistics, from the end of the Second World War to 2001, 248 armed conflicts occurred in 153 regions, of which 201 were initiated by the US. Since 2001, wars and military operations waged by the US have killed more than 900,000 people, about 335,000 of them civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions. US magazine The National Interest quoted Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow for defense programs at the Heritage Foundation, who wrote that the US consistently needed to deploy military force every 15 years or so. The US is proved to be “the most warlike nation in the history of the world”.Fact No. 7: Those who abide by the one-China principle are the overwhelming majority of countries in the world. Over 170 countries including ASEAN countries have expressed their commitment to the one-China principle. On this matter, it is the US and very few other countries that are isolated.According to preliminary statistics, in response to Pelosi’s visit, over 170 countries and international organizations have expressed their strong support for the one-China principle. Governments, political parties and senior officials of over 100 countries and multiple international organizations have publicly stated their support for China in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity. Countries that all together hold more than 80 percent of the world’s population are standing with China, on the right side of history and on the side of fairness and justice. Together, we advocate respecting the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, abiding by the basic norms governing international relations, and resolutely opposing any country’s interference in other countries’ internal affairs and infringement on other countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is the mainstream voice of the international community. The US cannot change the reality that an unjust move finds little support.Both the President of the UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary-General have clearly stated that the UN will continue to abide by UNGA Resolution 2758, the core of which is the one-China principle.President of Russia Vladimir Putin said at the 10th Moscow Conference on International Security that the US escapade towards Taiwan is not just a voyage by an irresponsible politician, but part of the purpose-oriented and deliberate US strategy designed to destabilize the situation and sow chaos in the region and the world. It is a brazen demonstration of disrespect for other countries and their own international commitments. Russia regards this as a thoroughly planned provocation. The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement describing Pelosi’s visit as a clear provocation in keeping with the US’s aggressive policy of comprehensive containment of China. It stated that relations between both sides of the Taiwan Strait are exclusively China’s domestic affair. The Chinese side is entitled to take any measures necessary to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in terms of the Taiwan question. Russia’s principled position remains unchanged: we operate on the premise that there is only one China, the PRC government is the only legitimate government representing all of China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega said that there is only one China in the world, and Pelosi’s visit is tantamount to an invasion of China, which shows that the practice of invasion is in the blood of the Yankee Empire.Responding to a question from the media, Spokesperson for the DPRK Foreign Ministry said that the impudent interference of the US in internal affairs of other countries and its intentional political and military provocations are, indeed, the root cause of harassed peace and security in the region. Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and the Taiwan question pertains to the internal affairs of China. The DPRK vehemently denounces any external force’s interference in the Taiwan question, and fully supports the Chinese government’s just stand to resolutely defend the sovereignty of the country and territorial integrity. The US scheme to disturb the growth and development of China and its efforts for accomplishing the cause of reunification is bound to go bankrupt.Spokesperson of the Afghan Interim Government’s Foreign Ministry stressed adherence to the one-China policy and urged all countries to refrain from decisions that are considered a violation of national sovereignty of states and would lay the groundwork for provocative actions.Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said in a statement that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is an example of the US’s meddlesome behavior in different regions and countries of the world. He noted that this behavior will only intensify instability and stokes differences, and, as such, it is deplorable.The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said in a statement that Syria condemns in the strongest terms the unprecedented escalation and policy of provocation practiced by the US against China. China has the non-negotiable or non-bargaining right to take the measures and steps it decides to defend its right to protect and preserve its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation issued a statement, reaffirming its support for China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the importance of respecting the one-China principle, while calling for adherence to relevant UN resolutions. The UAE indicated its concern over the impact of any provocative visits on stability and international peace.Eritrea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that at a time when the flaws and follies of its global policy have become more apparent, and in an attempt to ramp up its policy of containment of China, Washington has concocted the provocative visit of Pelosi to Taiwan with all its perilous ramifications. The latest act is but a continuation of reckless policies that the US administration has pursued in the past years in Asia to advance this singular objective, which is deplorable.South Africa’s National Assembly House Chairperson said in an interview that the US move is a gross interference in China’s internal affairs, ruining years of efforts in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It will inevitably endanger regional and world peace, stability and development.Zimbabwean Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcast Services and government spokesperson said that Zimbabwe stands fully behind the People’s Republic of China in the face of the intrusive and provocative visit by Pelosi, which seriously violates the one-China principle.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus said in a statement that it is with deep concern that it has followed an increase in tension provoked by the irresponsible persistence with which the US has been organizing Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. Belarus supports the consistent measures taken by China to reunify the country.Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg said that Pelosi’s visit is a useless provocation and that with this trip, there will be no more trust between the US and China. He also reiterated Luxembourg’s support for the one-China policy.The Vice President of the Senate of Mexico published an article, stating that the illegal visit of Pelosi to Taiwan is an interventionist action that seriously violates other country’s sovereignty and undermines regional peace and stability.Cuba’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement reiterating its firm rejection to the actions aimed at harming China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, condemning interference in China’s internal affairs, and emphasizing its concern over the increasing tensions and further deterioration of the situation concerning Taiwan as a direct result of the aggressive policy and high military presence of the US and its allies in the Taiwan Strait, and military contacts and regular sale of weapons that undermine international and regional peace.The Foreign Ministry of the Commonwealth of Dominica said in a statement that many sides and the international community have expressed serious concerns over Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and this visit constitutes a serious violation of China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said on its Twitter account that Pelosi’s visit is a direct provocation and serious threat to China’s independence and territorial integrity, and Venezuela firmly supports the one-China principle and urges the US to respect China’s sovereignty.During the 55th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and related meetings held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, ASEAN foreign ministers issued a Statement on the Cross Strait Development, reiterating ASEAN Member States’ support for their respective one-China policy. ASEAN countries have also, through statements of foreign ministries and spokespersons, publicly stressed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and opposed “Taiwan independence” and all attempts to create “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”. They support the Chinese government in upholding sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieving national reunification through peaceful means.The National Security Advisor of the Philippines said in an interview that the Philippines abides by the one-China policy, which means that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The Philippines will continue to honor the one-China policy.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore issued a press release on the meeting between Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and State Councilor Wang Yi, in which Balakrishnan states that Singapore has a clear and consistent one-China policy and is opposed to “Taiwan independence” and any unilateral moves to change the status quo, and stresses the need for stable China-US relations, which are vital for peace and security.Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is causing escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Myanmar opposes any provocative actions causing instabilities in the region and attempts that aim to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Myanmar fully supports the one-China policy and reaffirms that Taiwan is an integral part of the People’s Republic of China.Spokesperson of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan may escalate confrontation between China and the US. If not managed well, it may lead to open conflict and disrupt peace and stability, including in the Taiwan Strait. Indonesia continues to respect the one-China policy.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Laos released a statement reaffirming its consistent policy of supporting the one-China policy and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, opposing any intention aiming at creating a situation for “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”, and reiterating its firm support for the policy of China on national reunification by peaceful means.Cambodian government spokesperson said in an interview with China-Cambodia Friendship Radio FM 105 that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan violates the one-China principle and is a provocative move that stirs trouble and could trigger other crises. The whole world is therefore concerned. The Cambodian government highly commends countermeasures taken by China.The Malaysian Prime Minister’s Special Envoy to China released a statement urging Western nations not to practice double standards by trying to compare Taiwan with Ukraine, not to try to encircle Russia and call for respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on one hand while meddle in China’s internal affairs and intend to use Taiwan to divide China on the other. This would be using democracy as a pretext to interfere in and infringe upon China’s sovereignty, which violates basic principles of international law.Think tanks and media of many countries point out that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan violates the one-China principle, undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and is a seriously provocative move. Pelosi’s provocative move on the Taiwan question leads the US and the world to disorder and instability. Cross-Strait tensions are caused by US encroaching upon the common understanding reached with China.Singaporean scholar Kishore Mahbubani said that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is reckless, dangerous and irresponsible, and that she is trying to use Taiwan. Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned the US to stop its endless confrontations with China. Yet as the No. 3 political figure of the US, Pelosi refused to listen to any of Kissinger’s words and endangered the interests of the US and its people. She fanned the flames in our neighborhood, but refused to bear responsibility for the dangerous consequences she single-handedly created, which should be condemned.Founder of the French Institute of International Relations Dominique Moisi wrote in a column in Les Echos that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is primarily about her personal image and serving her interests in US Congressional midterm elections. The irresponsible US move has added uncertainties to an already uncertain and fragile world, increasing the risks of the situation spiraling out of control, and risks of complications and war.German international law scholar and former researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law Matthias Hartwig published an article in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung pointing out that the argument that China and Taiwan are two independent countries does not hold water. All attempts to support Taiwan’s separation from China, including Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, constitute interference in China’s internal affairs and violate international law.A Romanian international politics expert pointed out in a TV interview that Pelosi insisted on going to Taiwan despite strong opposition from the Chinese government and people, with the intention of triggering a geopolitical crisis. The one-China principle is in line with history and law, and is a consensus of the international community. The President of the Romanian Diplomatic Institute said in a video debate that the one-China principle is the political basis on which 181 countries have established diplomatic relations with China, and is written in black and white in the three China-US joint communiqus. China’s response to the matter demonstrates rationality and wisdom. The President expressed full support for China’s position. A Romanian political commentator published an article accusing Pelosi of trading peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region for votes, and pointed out that instead of manipulating the Taiwan question to contain China, the US should engage in direct and sincere dialogue.Fact No. 8: The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are different in nature. Taiwan is not and has never been a country. It is a part of China. The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are not comparable at all.Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The Taiwan question is left over from China’s civil war and purely China’s internal affair. The Ukraine issue is a dispute between two countries, Russia and Ukraine. Some people in the US have deliberately drawn parallels between the Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue to mischaracterize the nature of the Taiwan question, an issue which is purely China’s internal affair. This is also their attempt to seek to deny the legitimacy and rationality of the efforts of the Chinese government to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to serve the US’s geostrategic and economic interest at the expense of the welfare of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and regional peace and stability. This fully exposes their political calculation and sinister intention of using Taiwan to contain China.The ins-and-outs of the Ukraine issue are crystal clear. As the one who started the Ukraine crisis and the biggest factor fueling it, the US led five rounds of NATO eastward expansion over a span of two decades or so since 1999. NATO increased its membership from 16 to 30 countries and pushed its frontier over 1,000 kilometers eastward right up to Russian borders, forcing the latter step by step into the corner. Thomas Friedman, a US media veteran and The New York Times columnist, pointed out in an article that the ill-considered decision by the US to expand NATO led to the deterioration of ties with Russia and the US government deserves much of the blame.Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the US has done nothing to promote peace talks, but sought to benefit from the crisis through a proxy war. This has led to the continuous escalation of tensions and expanded, prolonged and complicated the conflict. This has fully exposed the selfish nature of the US side.While stressing respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity on Ukraine, the US has trampled on the red line on the Taiwan question and undermined China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is nothing but sheer double standard.The rejuvenation and reunification of the country are a surging trend. It is where the greater national interest lies, and it is what the people desire. The CPC has endeavored to pursue the historic mission of resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China’s complete reunification. We will work with the greatest sincerity and exert utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification, because this works best for the people on both sides and for our whole nation.We do not renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This is to guard against external interference and a tiny number of separatists and their separatist activities for “Taiwan independence”. It in no way targets our compatriots in Taiwan. Non-peaceful means will always remain a last resort.Fact No. 9: China’s sanctions against Pelosi in the wake of her visit to the Taiwan region are justified and lawful. As a sovereign country, China has every right to do so.The US’s moves to undermine China’s sovereignty and security have outraged the Chinese people and aroused strong opposition from the international community. China has taken the relevant steps in accordance with the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law. China’s response is also well-founded in international law and beyond reproach.Numerous facts and figures prove that the US is the most unscrupulous country that abuses sanctions. For a long time, the US has used democracy, human rights and national security as pretexts to impose unilateral sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction” on others, to seize geopolitical and economic interests and maintain its hegemony. This has seriously undermined the basic norms in international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. It has infringed the relevant countries’ right to development and their people’s right to subsistence.The US has enacted domestic laws such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, and the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and concocted a series of executive orders to directly impose sanctions on specific countries, organizations or individuals. It has arbitrarily expanded the jurisdiction of US domestic laws with ambiguous theories such as the “minimum contact” and “effects principle”, and abused domestic litigation channels to exercise “long-arm jurisdiction” over entities and individuals in other countries.Statistics show that the previous US administration imposed a total of over 3,900 sanction measures, equivalent to three sanctions on daily average. The number of sanctions designations of the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has grown from 912 in 2000 to 9,421 in October 2021, up by 933 percent. Daniel W. Drezner, Professor at Tufts University and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, published an article in Foreign Affairs in September 2021, saying that the “United States of America” has become a “United States of Sanctions”.The US frequently uses its global hegemony to arbitrarily slap sanctions on countries it regards as enemies or adversaries. Since 1962, the US has imposed on Cuba the longest and most severe systemic trade embargo, economic blockade and financial sanctions in modern history. As of 2021, the UNGA has adopted resolutions demanding an end of the US embargo of Cuba for 29th consecutive years. However, the US government keeps the embargo regardless of the just voices of the international community. Since late 1970s, the US has imposed long-term blockade and sanctions on Iran. In May 2018, the US government unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and subsequently resumed and added a host of sanctions against Iran. The US has also imposed unilateral sanctions on Belarus, Syria, Zimbabwe and other countries for years, and ramped up “maximum pressure” on the DPRK, Venezuela and other countries.For a long time, the US has launched economic and financial sanctions against Russia. According to statistics from the Russian State Duma, from 2014 to the beginning of May 2022, the number of sanctions imposed on Russia has reached an unprecedented 10,218, making Russia the most sanctioned country in the world, surpassing Iran. Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the US has kept escalating its unilateral sanctions against Russia and coerced the world to take sides. Mikhail Popov, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, said that while pressuring European countries into sanctioning Russia, the US increased crude oil imports from Russia and allowed its companies to import Russian mineral fertilizers. The war and sanctions have caused refugees inflow, capital outflow and energy shortage in Europe, but enabled the US to profit and make a fortune.The US has not hesitated to sanction its allies. In 1982, the US government arrested Hitachi and Mitsubishi employees on the charge of industrial espionage to suppress Japanese high-tech companies. In 2013, the US Department of Justice detained four senior executives of the French company Alstom, forcing the company to sell core businesses such as power and grid to General Electric at low prices. Out of geopolitical and energy-related calculus, the US has imposed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project since December 2019. In August 2020, in the dispute between the US and the EU over subsidies for Boeing and Airbus, the US announced that it would maintain its previous decision to impose a 15 percent tariff on large civil aircraft of Airbus. In the same month, then US President Donald Trump announced that in order to provide effective means to address the threatened impairment to the US national security from imports of aluminum from Canada, the US would reimpose the 10 percent tariff on imports of some Canadian aluminum. In December, the US government announced sanctions against Trkiye over its “significant transaction” with Russia to procure the S-400 air defense missile system.In recent years, the US has sanctioned Chinese institutions and personnel under the pretext of issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, human rights and others which are all China’s internal affairs. It also promulgated and implemented, based on lies and disinformation, the so-called “Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act”, which completely prohibits the importation of goods made in Xinjiang. In addition, the US has imposed so-called visa restrictions on more than 96 million CPC members and their families.The US overstretches the concept of national security, fabricates various excuses, abuses export control measures and uses state power to unreasonably suppress Chinese institutions and enterprises. All these have seriously undermined fair competition, market economy principles and international economic and trade rules. The US has put more than 1,000 Chinese enterprises and institutions on various sanctions lists; designated biotechnology and artificial intelligence as key technologies over which export controls are strengthened and investment reviews intensified; and suppressed social media applications including TikTok and WeChat.Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and citizens’ privacy, the Trump administration launched a “Clean Network” program. It explicitly requires the removal of Chinese companies such as Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba from telecom carriers, mobile app stores, mobile apps, cloud services and undersea cables.China opposes illegal unilateral sanctions and believes that sanctions are never the fundamental or effective way to solve problems. Wielding the stick of sanctions will only inflict serious difficulties on the economy and people’s livelihood in the relevant countries.Fact No. 10: Pelosi’ s visit to Taiwan has seriously undermined the political foundation of China-US relations and created obstacles to exchanges and cooperation between the two sides. The US must take full responsibility for it.The Taiwan question is at the very heart of China’s core interests. The US, while seriously undermining China’s core interests, is asking for China’s cooperation where they need it. The US expects China to accept a fait accompli and swallow the bitter fruit of having its core interests seriously damaged. This is typical hegemonic mentality and gangster logic.The most important thing in cooperation is mutual respect and mutual benefit. For cooperation to happen, there needs to be the right atmosphere and conditions. Prior to Pelosi’s visit, China put forward cooperation proposals in eight areas and a substantial list for dialogue and cooperation, which fully demonstrated China’s willingness to cooperate. However, the US only wants cooperation in areas of interest to itself and lacks sincerity about China’s cooperation proposals. Moreover, the US has kept introducing negative measures on China, which has seriously disrupted China-US exchange and cooperation.The current US administration has on multiple occasions articulated to China the “five-noes” commitment (i.e. the US does not seek a new Cold War with China, that it does not aim to change China’s system, that the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China, that it does not support “Taiwan independence”, and that it has no intention to seek a conflict with China). However, it says one thing and does another, and has been constantly interfering in China’s internal affairs and damaging China’s interests on issues concerning China’s core interests and major concerns.Clinging to the Cold War mentality and hegemonic logic, the US has sought bloc politics and concocted the “democracy versus authoritarianism” narrative. It has roped in other countries into its small circles, bolstered the Five Eyes alliance, peddled the Quad, created AUKUS, and stepped up bilateral military alliances. It has also tried every possible means to build an Asia-Pacific version of NATO and advanced “integrated deterrence” against China.The US has enacted the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which prohibits chip funds from being used for investment in China and Chinese companies from participating in the Manufacturing USA network. It also calls for strengthening security precautions for scientific research against China and assessing China’s “threat” to US science and technology. The Trump administration seriously violated WTO rules and launched a large-scale trade war with China. Citing the so-called Section 301 investigation, the US has imposed three rounds of additional high tariffs on about 360 billion US dollars worth of Chinese goods. This erroneous move has not been rectified yet.China, while firmly opposing all kinds of egregious actions by the US that undermine cooperation, has always sought to advance the sound and steady development of China-US relations for the sake of the welfare of the people of both countries and the world as well as the expectation of the international community and people of the rest of the world. It is the US, not China, that undermines China-US relations and exchanges and cooperation. The US should seriously reflect on what it has done.Fact No. 11: The responsibility for the suspension of China-US climate talks is on the United States. When it comes to climate change and other issues about global governance on the environment, China will stay committed to international cooperation and continue to honor our commitments with real actions.China has been making utmost efforts to scale up its response to climate change. In 2020, China announced new targets for its nationally determined contributions. We will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. We are committed to moving from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in a much shorter time span than what might take many developed countries.China has been working steadfastly toward its carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets. Since President Xi Jinping declared those targets in 2020, the Chinese government has announced major domestic policy measures on climate response on multiple occasions, and continued to build a 1+N policy framework on carbon peak and carbon neutrality. In October 2021, the Working Guidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in Full and Faithful Implementation of the New Development Philosophy issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council and the Action Plan For Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030 were released, which together became the top-arching design running through the two phases of carbon peak and carbon neutrality of China. Implementation plans by sectors, including energy, energy-saving and emissions reduction, circular economy, green consumption, industrial development, urban and rural development and transport, have been introduced. The 1+N policy framework is basically put in place.China has followed the philosophy of ecological development and has made achievements in green transition. President Xi Jinping’s quote that clear water and green mountains are as valuable as gold and silver has become a shared view among the Chinese public. In 2020, China’s carbon emissions intensity dropped by 18.8 percent compared to that of 2015, overachieving the binding target laid out in the 13th Five-Year Plan. It dropped 48.4 percent from the 2005 level, meaning China had overachieved the target of reducing the intensity by 40 to 45 percent in 2020 compared to 2005, a commitment China made to the world. China reduced about 5.8 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in cumulative terms, and the rapid growth of CO2 emissions was largely reversed. Since the beginning of this century, China has accounted for a quarter of the world’s new afforestation. China has met the previous goals for its pollution prevention and control tasks were completed with remarkable success, and significantly reduced the number of heavy pollution days. In the report released in June 2022, the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago pointed out that PM2.5 pollution fell in China by almost 40 percent between 2013 and 2020, which is almost equivalent to what the US reduced over 30 years after 1970.China’s contributions on energy conservation, energy efficiency, development of renewable energy, transportation, and construction basically all account for 30 to 50 percent of the global total. In 2021, non-fossil energy accounted for 16.6 percent of energy consumption in China. China was the top consumer of non-fossil energy in the world. China’s use of renewable energy and total installed power generation capacity have reached record highs, with the installed scale of hydropower, wind power, photovoltaic and biomass power generation staying at the top of the world. China is committed to reaching a total installed capacity of 1.2 billion kilowatts of wind and solar power by 2030, which alone will exceed the total installed power capacity of the US. China’s production and sales of new energy vehicles have ranked first in the world for seven consecutive years. China’s installed share of coal power generation dropped historically to below 50 percent in 2020, total emissions from the coal power industry fell by nearly 90 percent over a decade, and coal consumption of thermal power units has been reduced significantly, saving over 700 million tonnes of raw coal over the decade.China actively promotes the building of a fair, reasonable, cooperative and mutually beneficial global climate and environmental governance system. As an important participant in global climate governance, China has always actively participated in the main-channel negotiations on climate change and made historic contributions to the conclusion of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. China hosted Part I of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October 2021, which injected fresh impetus into global governance on biodiversity.China strongly supports the development of green and low-carbon energy in developing countries. China upholds the concept of “teaching people to fish” and does its best to help developing countries, especially small island countries, African countries and LDCs, to reduce the adverse impact of climate change and improve their capacity to cope with it. Over the past 10-plus years, China has invested about 1.2 billion yuan in South-South cooperation on climate change and signed 40 cooperation documents with 35 countries. For nearly eight years up to 2021, China had implemented more than 200 Chinese aid projects to help other countries address climate change, provided energy-saving and new energy products and equipment to nearly 40 countries, and trained about 2,000 officials and professionals in the field of climate change for 120 developing countries. In April 2022, China launched the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Center to add new momentum to climate action in small island countries.The US has a poor track record on climate change. The US is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases in cumulative terms. Its per capita carbon emissions have remained high. They are more than double those of China. The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It withdrew from the Paris Agreement at one point, and is slow to fulfill its financial commitments under the Green Climate Fund. It has also used the so-called Xinjiang-related issues as a pretext to sanction and suppress Chinese photovoltaic companies, hindering the global development of new energy. The US has not yet joined the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has long stayed outside the global biodiversity protection system.Since the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009, the US still has not earnestly fulfilled its commitments of providing climate finance for developing countries. According to a report released by the World Resources Institute in October 2021, indicators including GDP and cumulative greenhouse gas emissions suggest the US should contribute between 40 and 47 percent of the total 100 billion US dollars climate finance effort in 2018. But the US provided less than 20 percent of its due share with a shortfall of at least 21 billion US dollars and up to 40 billion US dollars. The US lack of credibility and due responsibility has severely undermined the process of global climate governance.In June 2022, a US Supreme Court’s ruling decided that the Environmental Protection Agency has no right to limit greenhouse gas emissions at the state level, and cannot force power plants to move away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. This decision will further undermine the Biden administration’s capability to respond to climate change. Stphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, indicated at the regular noon briefing that the US Supreme Court’s ruling is a setback in the global fight against climate change and makes it even more difficult to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.China will, as always, actively participate in international and multilateral cooperation to address climate change. China will continue to unswervingly move toward the targets of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, actively participate in main-channel negotiations on climate change, provide support and assistance to developing countries to the best of its capabilities, and make its own contribution to addressing the global challenge of climate change.The cooperation between China and the US in the field of climate change cannot be separated from the overall environment of China-US relations. Due to the egregious impact of Pelosi’s provocative visit to Taiwan, China had to suspend the bilateral climate talks with the US. All consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by the US. The US needs to stop looking for new excuses for its inaction on climate change. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0825/c90000-10139281.html,25,8,2022,"['china', 'taiwan', 'international', 'countries', 'government', 'pelosi', 'visit', 'sovereignty', 'united', 'states', 'principle', 'climate', 'territorial', 'integrity', 'relations', 'policy', 'change', 'strait', 'foreign', 'sanctions']",0.3482419211964663,0.02186012799649164,25/8/2022

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)Progress on U.S. inflation front ""all too likely"" will come at the expense of a hard economic landing, because the Fed, in its quest to regain control over inflation, likely will keep raising interest rates by 75 basis points even as the economy is weakening and inflation is peaking. WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer inflation in July surged 8.5 percent from a year ago, down from the previous month´s fresh four-decade high but still at elevated level, the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday.The consumer price index (CPI) was unchanged in July after rising 1.3 percent in June, according to the department´s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).The so-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy, ticked up 0.3 percent in July following a 0.7-percent rise the prior month. Core CPI jumped 5.9 percent over the last 12 months.""Consumer price inflation surprised to the downside in July,"" Sarah House and Michael Pugliese, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in an analysis.""Falling prices for gasoline, used autos and travel service categories such as airline fares, car rentals and lodging away from home helped cool monthly inflation from the torrid pace seen in May and June,"" House and Pugliese said.A price board is seen at a gas station in Oregon, the United States, July 13, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)The June CPI of 9.1 percent marked the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1981, following a 8.6 percent growth in May. CPI has remained over 8 percent since March, a stark reminder that the Fed has a long way to go to bring elevated inflation under control.Desmond Lachman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told Xinhua that the main reason that headline inflation dropped in July was that gasoline and airline prices plummeted, noting that it did so as international oil declined in response to the ""sharp deterioration"" in the world economic outlook.The energy index fell 4.6 percent over the month, after soaring 7.5 percent in June. The gasoline index fell 7.7 percent in July and ""offset increases in the food and shelter indexes,"" resulting in the all items index being unchanged over the month, the BLS report noted.The food index rose 1.1 percent over the month after growing 1.0 percent in June. The food at home index rose 1.3 percent, up from 1.0 percent in previous month.The food index increased 10.9 percent over the last year, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending May 1979.""Today´s encouraging consumer price numbers suggest that inflation very likely has peaked and will continue to come down in a sustained manner,"" Lachman said.However, he said, they also suggest that progress on the inflation front ""all too likely"" will come at the expense of a hard economic landing, because in its quest to regain control over inflation the Fed likely will keep raising interest rates by 75 basis points even as the economy is weakening and inflation is peaking.People participate in the Texworld USA 2022 trading fair in New York City, the United States, July 19, 2022. (Xinhua/Liu Yanan)House and Pugliese noted that monetary policymakers have made clear that they need to see clear evidence of a sustained slowdown in inflation before pivoting on monetary policy.""In our view, it will take several more soft inflation prints before the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) begins to feel confident that it is getting price pressures in check,"" said House and Pugliese.At least a 50-basis-point rate hike at the September FOMC meeting remains ""the most likely outcome,"" they added.According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group´s FedWatch tool, the probability of a 50-basis-point rate hike at the Fed´s next policy meeting was 57.5 percent on Wednesday.The central bank raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point from near zero in March, beginning its tightening cycle to curb surging inflation.

CalFire, the state agency responsible for leading California´s wildfire prevention and suppression, reported that over 17,000 square kilometers got burned in 2020.The 2020 fires were followed by another extreme fire season with about 10,000 square kilometers burned in 2021.The study noted that without considering future vegetation regrowth, CO2e emissions from the 2020 wildfires could be the second most important source in the Golden State above either industry or electrical power generation.The study also warned a positive feedback loop between climate change and wildfire that´s very negative.Michael Jerrett, lead author of the study and a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, was quoted by the USA Today on Tuesday as saying that climate change is creating conditions conducive to larger wildfires while the wildfires are adding to the greenhouse gases that cause climate change.""Our analysis suggests that significant societal benefits could accrue from larger investments in improved forest management and stricter controls on new development in fire-prone areas at the wildland-urban interface,"" the study said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1019/c90000-10160605.html,19,10,2022,"['california', 'study', 'wildfires', 'emissions', 'wildfire', 'greenhouse', 'gas', 'climate', 'change', 'los', 'angeles', 'carbon', 'dioxide', 'reductions', 'environmental', 'million', 'metric', 'tons', 'state', 'square']",0.5593750000000001,0.1693181818181818,19/10/2022

He had bought a semi-automatic rifle and 1,000 rounds of hollow-point ammunition online weeks ago and drove 11 hours to El Paso from his hometown Allen in northern Texas with the sole intent of killing immigrants, the indictment says.Prosecutors recommended that he receive 90 consecutive life sentences. The judge will consider sentencing in June.""White nationalist-fueled violence has no place in our society today,"" U.S. Justice Department´s Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement. ""By pleading guilty, the defendant has admitted that he murdered innocent people based on their national origin and targeted Hispanics.""The U.S. Justice Department announced last month that it would not seek the death penalty in federal charges. As a result, the maximum federal sentence the white male from Texas faces is life in prison.Crusius also faces state charges for the mass shooting. Texas prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty but a trial has not been scheduled yet.A database of mass killings in the United States since 2006 compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University shows that the number of deadly mass shootings linked to hate crimes has increased in recent years across the United States, AP reported.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0209/c90000-10205617.html,9,2,2023,"['el', 'paso', 'guilty', 'texas', 'mass', 'charges', 'counts', 'shooting', 'crusius', 'federal', 'killing', 'hate', 'death', 'years', 'place', 'hispanics', 'admitted', 'crime', 'violence', 'today']",0.5188095238095238,-0.14242857142857143,9/2/2023
"Asia continues to improve, Europe provides key to further World Cup success - People's Daily Online","Asia continues to improve, Europe provides key to further World Cup success (Xinhua) 09:24, December 07, 2022DOHA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Asia said goodbye to the 2022 FIFA World Cup on Monday night with the exits of Japan and South Korea.Japan saw Croatia march on after a penalty shootout and South Korea suffered a 4-1 defeat to tournament favorites Brazil.There was frustration for Japan, who for the fourth time fell at the last 16 without being able to reach the quarterfinals, while South Korea was unable to repeat their feats of 2002, when they got to the semifinals on home soil.Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu said he was proud of his players, and despite once again crashing into the glass ceiling of the last eight, he said they had laid the foundations for the future.""The players can be confident that they can play on the world stage and they showed they can play in the World Cup. I think Japanese football can continue to grow.""""We can play against the world and beat the world and the players have shown a new era of Japanese football, and they should use this feeling of frustration to win next time,"" he said after the game.Although the tournament ultimately ends in frustration for Asian football, there are indeed positives.Six Asian teams competed in Qatar, including Australia, who also battled into the knockout stages with brave displays against Tunisia and Denmark before falling to a narrow defeat to a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.The fact that three sides from six made it into the last 16 has to be viewed in a positive light, even more so with Saudi Arabia and Iran also winning games here in Qatar.Saudi Arabia stunned Argentina in their opening group game, before pushing Poland hard and wasting chances in their second match. Although big game nerves maybe got the better of them against Mexico, the experience will be important to get prepared for the 2026 World Cup.Iran was well beaten by England in their opening match, but Carlos Queiroz´s team recovered and showed personality to beat Wales in emotional circumstances, to go into their last group match needing just a draw to qualify.They eventually lost 1-0 to an energetic USA, but showed they too can make an impact on the world stage.The only Asian side not to win a game was hosts Qatar, who is ranked 50th in the world by FIFA. They were the weakest side in the tournament, but even so, Qatari football has improved enormously and with the facilities now available to local players, they are capable of pushing to qualify again in 2026.19 players from the Japan squad now play for European clubs, while eight South Koreans also play in European football. However, only one Korean defender - Kim Min-jae - plays in Europe and defense was their weak spot in the tournament.12 Iranians also play in Europe, with the majority in Greece and Turkey, while all of the Saudi Arabians compete in their homeland, although Salem Al-Dawsari had a brief spell with Spanish side Villarreal.Although it is possible to bring top European coaches to Asia, the fact is that Europe is still the place to go in order to pick up the big-game experience at domestic and continental level that is needed at the very top level.That is also true for China as well, bearing in mind only a handful of Chinese players, such as Wu Lei and Sun Jihai, have competed at top European clubs. In order to succeed, it is not enough to be technically good; it is necessary to learn the tactical game as well and develop the competitive edge that La Liga, the Premier League or the Bundesliga can provide.South America can also provide experience, but a look at where the top South American players ply their trade shows they too follow the European route to success.But the display of Asian sides in Qatar will certainly attract more and more scouts, and in 2026, it won't be a surprise if an Asian side finally breaks into the quarterfinals.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1207/c90000-10180582.html,7,12,2022,"['players', 'south', 'play', 'game', 'japan', 'football', 'asian', 'european', 'europe', 'cup', 'tournament', 'qatar', 'side', 'top', 'asia', 'korea', 'frustration', 'showed', 'saudi', 'match']",0.4138030888030887,0.1312331812331812,7/12/2022

US falls into 'isolationist mentality' by pushing Inflation Reduction Act to curb China's new-energy rise - People's Daily Online,"US falls into 'isolationist mentality' by pushing Inflation Reduction Act to curb China´s new-energy rise (Global Times) 10:17, August 17, 2022　　Illustration: Chen Xia/GTUS President Joe Biden is about to sign another ""massive"" law entitled the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) on Tuesday, but the soon-to-be law, demonstrating Washington´s desperate yet isolationist mentality, unsurprisingly has a more obvious intention of curbing China´s influence in the new-energy sector, may ironically end up only inflaming its runaway inflation, further disrupt the global industrial chain, and deter achieving climate goals, analysts said.Industry observers noted the bill, followed the just-passed CHIPS Act, underscores how Washington felt it has been ""intimidated"" by China´s rising tech prowess and its own incompetence in maintaining its supremacy in new-energy vehicle (NEV) technology amid a lingering tech war it has launched against the world´s second-largest economy.The series of moves targeting China signal that Washington now is embracing protectionism, rather than confidently participating in international competition amid the sense of loss, reminding some people of the arrogant and closed Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) - the last imperial dynasty of China that fading from the heights of its power over protectionism policies and isolationist mentality, observers said.The IRA, passed by the US House on Friday and the Senate on Sunday, is now awaiting US President Joe Biden´s signature to become law. The bill unlocks over $300 billion in spending on green energy and climate reform, including funding for consumer tax credits to offset the costs of electric vehicles.However, the bill points out that to qualify for the tax credit, NEV makers must complete vehicle assembly in North America and source a significant percentage of major battery components, including metals like lithium, nickel and cobalt, from the US or countries that have free trade agreements with the US.Yet, China, the world´s largest producer of those vital components, does not have a free trade agreement with the US.""Most terms attached to subsidies for carmakers stipulate the places of NEV assembly, but it is a rare case in a global sphere to also include places where battery minerals and units should be processed. Such overreach lays bare the US' malicious intention to suppress the whole high-tech industrial chain in China,"" Feng Shiming, an auto analyst with Shanghai-based Menutor Consulting, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Feng said the US' offensive is in stark contrast to China´s open-minded and inclusive industry policy, under which all NEV carmakers in China, regardless of homegrown or foreign peers such as Tesla, are entitled to industry subsidies as long as they meet criteria.The bill actually makes it more clear that the long-lasting true intention of the US is to strangle China´s new-energy rise, in case it was not obvious enough when the US cracked down on Chinese solar panel makers in Northeast China´s Xinjiang Autonomous Region with the allegations of the ""forced labor,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Under the eye-catching name of fighting inflation, and putting all those mixed hodgepodge policies together, the contradictory and confusing bill again indicates that the only consensus the Democrats and the Republicans have reached is to crack down on China´s tech rise, Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.It is not clear how much determination the US has to defend itself against inflation - but not quite as much as legislators want to crack down on China and maintain its technology dominance, Gao said.""The discriminatory rules also put it at a risk of violating WTO rules,"" Gao said.""With this legislation… the CHIPS and Science Act, and a range of executive actions, the US is in a stronger position to maintain our global competitive edge for years to come,"" US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement following Congressional passage of the IRA on Friday.Haikou hosts the new energy vehicle (NEV) show in South China´s Hainan Province on Friday. Close to 300 new energy and intelligent connected vehicles are on display at the fair. Officials said China will raise the proportion of NEV sector to 20 percent of total new auto sales by 2025. Photo: cnsphotoUnrealistic planDescribing the bill as political grandstanding that fully demonstrates Washington´s isolationist mentality, industry observers said the bill could inflict drastic harm on the US as well as the global NEV industry and further inflame its runaway inflation, while its impact on the rise of Chinese NEV-makers is ""negligible and within control.""Currently, 70 percent of the 72 EV models on sale in the US market would not qualify for subsidies when the bill is signed, according to a report by industry website autosinnovate.org. Virtually none would be able to access the financial incentive in the next few years when additional sourcing requirements come into effect, which could further exacerbate US consumers' woes.""Unfortunately, the NEV tax credit requirements will make most vehicles immediately ineligible for the incentive. That´s a missed opportunity at a crucial time and… will also jeopardize our collective target of 40-50 percent electric vehicle sales by 2030,"" John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a blog published on the official website of the alliance on August 5.""It is almost impossible that any Fair Trade Alliance countries could fill China´s raw material gap for the USA´s NEV demand between now and 2024,"" read a Fortune report, citing Simon Moores, chief executive of lithium market analyst Benchmark.Leading Chinese battery-makers including CATL and BYD jointly account for about half of global market share. For carmakers in the US, Europe, Japan and South Korea ranging from Tesla, BMW, Toyota, Kia and Hyundai, cutting ties with Chinese suppliers could drive up cost by ""a significant percentage"" in terms of purchase and delivery, Feng explained.And while the US has put severe strains on its allies, aiming to loop them into a small clique to exclude China from the global supply chain, analysts also predict few companies would buy into such scheme considering the sky-high costs.""We have no plans to build a factory in the US yet. Apart from subsidies, we need to assess the market situation and resource endowment,"" a representative from a global- leading solar panel maker told the Global Times on Tuesday, indicating the firm has to weigh whether these so-called incentives can make the cost of building a brand-new industrial chain in the US.""Localization always comes with huge front-loaded expense. For example, yield is key to battery making, and it may take years of adjustment and accommodation to achieve a relatively high yield rate in the US, not to mention building a NEV supply chain from scratch,"" Feng said, while also questioning whether the market in the US is ""big enough"" to draw in NEV car makers.""It is undeniable that if foreign carmakers drift away from Chinese suppliers, the latter´s sales would tumble. But that loss could soon be made up with China´s prodigious and booming home market,"" Feng noted.Industry players also questioned whether the bill can be carried on given the US' heavy reliance on Chinese components, mounting debt, and severe domestic economic problems. Moreover, in the US, policies are normally not sustainable amid the rotating political parties.""The bill, if it comes into effect, will also bring up the cost and delay the progress of achieving global climate goals,"" Lin warned.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0817/c90000-10136170.html,17,8,2022,"['china', 'global', 'nev', 'bill', 'energy', 'industry', 'inflation', 'market', 'times', 'tuesday', 'chain', 'makers', 'feng', 'isolationist', 'mentality', 'act', 'rise', 'washington', 'tech', 'vehicle']",0.3911022782249196,0.04819957558165106,17/8/2022

Almost all states witnessing mass shootings over the weekend don't require a license to carry concealed loaded guns.""Instead, state lawmakers have pushed Right to Carry laws that either eliminate the need to get a license to carry concealed guns or make getting such a license very easy,"" Webster said. ""But the 'more guns everywhere' approach has been found to increase violent crime and does nothing to reduce mass shootings.""Researchers on gun violence say legislative disorder in the United States has fueled gun violence severity. A case in point was the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2022 to strike down a New York state law that limits gun-carrying in public.The high court´s ruling that set new standards for evaluating gun laws left many open questions, resulting in an increasing number of conflicting decisions as lower court judges need help figuring out how to apply it, the Associated Press reported.In several instances, judges looking at the same laws have come down on opposite sides on whether they are constitutional in the wake of the conservative Supreme Court´s majority ruling, it reported, calling the phenomenon ""legal turmoil,"" for which the Supreme Court needs to step in soon to provide more guidance for judges.The weekend also put a 3-billion-U.S.-dollar industry of companies working to ""protect children or employees"" into the limelight, as gun violence particularly ravaged U.S. schools in recent months, like the attack at the elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year, and the tragedy at Michigan State University last week.As the New York Times listed, the offerings are numerous: automatically locking doors, bullet-resistant tables, Kevlar backpacks, artificial intelligence that detects guns and countless types of training exercises, like breathing techniques to avoid panic during an attack or strategies for how to use a pencil to pierce a shooter´s eyes.However, the effectiveness of such products and services must still be proven.Calling it an entire industry that capitalizes on school shootings, Odis Johnson, the executive director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, said that these companies have very little evidence that what they are selling works. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0224/c90000-10212544.html,24,2,2023,"['gun', 'shootings', 'weekend', 'violence', 'mass', 'state', 'court', 'guns', 'york', 'feb', 'states', 'high', 'attack', 'director', 'license', 'carry', 'laws', 'supreme', 'judges', 'bloodiest']",0.43214253647586987,0.06707812249478914,24/2/2023

US urged to explain Nord Stream blasts after Pulitzer winner's probe - People's Daily Online,"US urged to explain Nord Stream blasts after Pulitzer winner´s probeBy Wang Qi (Global Times) 08:23, February 10, 2023Six months after the explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines which shocked the world, an article by veteran US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has accused the US of being the culprit of the blasts.Washington has denied the accusations without further explanation, but the article immediately prompted a fierce verbal confrontation between the US and Russia and making waves in geopolitics.Given previous US behaviors, Chinese experts believe that the Hersh report is highly credible and Washington´s denial cannot hinder Russia´s determination to dig out more evidence from the report´s value as a clue.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday urged the US to give an explanation over its role in 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""The White House must now comment on all these facts,"" Zakharova said in a post on her Telegram page.In response, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Wednesday that the investigative article was ""utterly false and complete fiction,"" and the CIA and Pentagon also dismissed the allegation with similar rhetoric, according to media reports.Hersh, an 85-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, published the article on his personal website on Wednesday, stating the US military involvement of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines after senior White House officials' nine-month long plot inside the national security community.Citing sources with direct knowledge of the plot, the article revealed many details of the operation: Explosives were planted by US Navy divers under the cover of the NATO maritime exercise; and a surveillance plane of NATO member Norway triggered the explosives on September 26, 2022 after US President Joe Biden greenlighted the operation.Although there´s no final verdict on who was responsible, the US, NATO, as well as investigators from Sweden and Denmark agreed it was ""a result of sabotage.""Finding smoking gunSome US media had blamed Russia as the likely culprit soon after the Nord Stream explosion in September 2022, but Hersh wrote that political elites from his country has more incentives to destroy the pipeline regarding their words prior to the incident.On February 7, 2022, US President Joe Biden threatened that ""if Russian tanks or troops cross the border of Ukraine, there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.""At a press conference in September 2022 about the consequences of the worsening energy crisis in Western Europe, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested halting Nord Stream is a ""tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy"" and stop Russia from ""weaponizing energy"" for political purposes.If Biden were an ordinary citizen, and a tube explosion had happened somewhere in the US after Biden made those threats, his words would have been interpreted by the US procurator as a strong motive, and Biden would bear legal liability,Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.Hersh proved his credibility in his investigations on the 1969 massacre of Vietnamese civilians by US forces and US troops brutalizing Iraqi prisoners after the US invasion in 2003, which prompted Lü to believe in his latest investigation of the North Stream pipeline explosion.""Even if it´s not 100 percent accurate - exposure of such shady activity can hardly be 100 percent accurate - it´s definitely not made up out of nowhere,"" Lü noted.As of press time, US mainstream media including The New York Times and The Washington Post maintained silence on the matter, which is qualified to be top on a US newspaper´s front page.Lü suspected the consistent silence was a sound coordination between the US media and the US government, and the strategy is to deny it and wipe it from news portals even if their smoking gun was caught.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that as the US had used washing powder to accuse Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction, it´s a genius of playing dirty.Hersh´s courage should be praised, yet analysts expressed concerns about his safety.It is obvious that the US benefited most from the destroyed pipelines. ""If the US was behind the sabotage, definitely the Americans would have carefully planned how to destroy or hide the evidence and mislead the public,"" Li said.Lü said that without an entity in legal sense to be in charge of such international disputes, it is almost impossible to establish a legal fact even if more evidence further support the point that the US was the culprit. But this investigative report will strengthen Russia´s determination to dig out more evidence, he said.Reactions to the blasts by some Western leaders also added to suspicion of US, including then British Prime Minister Liz Truss' texting ""it´s done"" to Blinken and former Polish foreign minister´s tweet ""Thank you, USA.""In January 2023, Russia blamed that Sweden and Denmark, who were investigating holes in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, ""have something to hide"" and blocked Russia from engaging in the joint investigation.""Whether or not the US is the culprit, Europe has acted too obedient. It is also tragic that as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies, Europe has less and less room to bargain with US on security issues,"" Li said.European politicians should reflect on whether blindly following the US would ultimately benefit Europe, or just the opposite, the expert said. He urged Europe to effectively strengthen autonomy. ""Otherwise incidents like the Nord Steam pipeline blasts could happen again, and the price will again be paid by Europe, not the US.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0210/c90000-10205783.html,10,2,2023,"['nord', 'stream', 'russia', 'hersh', 'europe', 'explosion', 'pipelines', 'article', 'biden', 'blasts', 'times', 'culprit', 'evidence', 'urged', 'global', 'gas', 'investigative', 'washington', 'report', 'foreign']",0.3565375982042648,0.04880284324728771,10/2/2023

US society wrong to unleash anti-Asia hate - People's Daily Online,"US society wrong to unleash anti-Asia hate (China Daily) 15:04, February 24, 2023This photo shows the White House and a stop sign in Washington DC, the United States. [Photo/Xinhua]Just in the recent past, two new anti-Chinese hate incidents have been identified with the left in the United States. The cases are different, but the bias is not. One stems from liberal educators who kept secret the notifications of students who had attained National Merit Scholar status in order to advance equity (dictated by the deep state and opposed to the equality of opportunity that is an American tradition).The second is the case of Asians killed during the Chinese New Year celebrations in Los Angeles.The first involved mostly Asian students — 75 percent of the victims are of Asian origin with the majority of them being Chinese — who excelled in their high school in Virginia. Left-leaning schoolteachers and principals withheld news of the merit scholar list ostensibly to not offend students who were not high achievers and to advance equity.Many of the students who were kept in the dark about their merit status were cheated out of money in the form of a scholarship and/or an accolade that would have helped them get admission to a good university and likely a scholarship. The students were not informed on time to meet university application deadlines as the official merit lists were kept at the school or were with teachers or school officials for a week or more.The students were ""robbed"" and their academic career scarred. Most were discriminated against because of their race and because they are intelligent, hardworking and driven to excel.Critics argue that this policy is not only racist, but also demeans the US and puts the country at a disadvantage in global competition against China and other countries at a time when the US is in decline and fast losing its status as a great power.Some even compare it to Hitler´s pogroms of Jews during World War II, which forced many Jewish scientists to migrate to the US where they helped build the atomic bomb, which brought the war to an end, and later played a crucial role in the US' space program that led to American astronauts landing on the moon. Similarly, many Chinese scientists have returned home in recent times because of the anti-Chinese hate crimes and the Biden administration´s anti-China policies.What the school administrations and teachers did is said to have advanced the American Teachers Association´s liberal ideas. Yet the incident came to light only after students at Thomas Jefferson High School in northern Virginia, the top high school in the US according to the US News and World Reports, complained to the higher authorities about the discrimination. But many say that this has been happening in schools elsewhere in the US for some time now.However, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, a conservative Republican just elected to office, took measures to make the practice unconstitutional, for which he has been widely applauded so much that some people have said he has a chance of becoming the Republican Party´s candidate for president in 2024.The second anti-Asian hate incident occurred in Los Angeles. In a violent attack on a Lunar New Year event, 11 people were killed and nine injured. Since the perpetrator was a person of Vietnamese origin who subsequently killed himself, details about his motives are not certain.The history of anti-Asian killings and racial discrimination against Asians in Los Angeles is legend. According to the Los Angeles Times, anti-Asian hate crimes increased 177 percent in Los Angeles in 2021, with some California officials calling it an ""epidemic of hate"". The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism says Los Angeles is the number one city in the US when it comes to the number of hate crimes.Many crime suspects in Los Angeles are not prosecuted owing to the extremely liberal policies of the city government under district attorney George Gascon, who was elected with the help of George Soros, a financier with leftist views who contributed $2 million to Gascon´s election campaign.Gascon´s policy of going soft on many perpetrators of hate crimes has hit Asians hard, with many protesting against him and his administration. Defending the police, to many Asians, has become an excuse for not enforcing the law when the victims of hate crimes are Asians with people of Chinese origin being at the top of the list.USA Today reported that Monterey Park, the small suburb of Los Angeles County sometimes called the Chinese Beverly Hills, where the incident occurred, was the site of a disproportionate number of incidents of anti-Asian violence and crimes.Monterey Park is known in Los Angeles as an Asian haven, with two-thirds of its residents being Asians, almost 50 percent of whom are Chinese. The mayor is Chinese as are a number of other city officials. Many say a large share of business in the city is conducted in Mandarin. Monterey is a prosperous place, and eschews teaching woke and following leftist ideals, provoking the left in Los Angeles.The media often reports that hate against Asians intensified after previous US president Donald Trump said the novel coronavirus originated in China, and called COVID-19 the ""kung flu"" and launched the trade war with China. A Pew Foundation poll, however, showed this is not a serious concern to Americans.No wonder students at Harvard, led by Chinese students, sued the university for racial bias, alleging that the number of Asian students would be double in the university if it were not for the racial bias in the admission policy. While Trump supported their suit when he was in office, in a similar suit filed by students at Yale during Biden´s tenure, the Department of Justice refused to hear the case.Behind the anti-Asian, anti-Chinese in particular, hate crimes is the ill-will espoused by the mainstream media toward China, alleging that China is trying to destroy the liberal world order, spying on the US, stealing US technology, and perpetrating human rights abuses. This is blatant provocative propaganda, aimed at inciting anti-Chinese sentiments in the US which must be exposed for what it is.The author is the Stanley J. Buckman professor (emeritus) of International Studies at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee.

Anything is possible through sport - People's Daily Online,"Anything is possible through sportBy Yiech Pur Biel (People´s Daily App) 16:48, October 28, 2022Editor´s notes: On October 28, the Olympic Refuge Foundation and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team will be honored with the 2022 Princess of Asturias Award for Sports at a ceremony in Oviedo, Spain. Here, Yiech Pur Biel – a member of the first-ever IOC Refugee Olympic Team at Rio 2016 and, since 2022, the first-ever refugee elected as an IOC Member – reflects on this historic recognition of the power of sport in helping millions of displaced people around the world, as well as his own journey.Photo provided to People´s DailyThere are only two times in my life that I’ve cried: when my mother left me, and when I received the news that I would be on the first-ever IOC Refugee Olympic Team. When I walked into the Olympic Stadium with my teammates for the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games Rio 2016, it was a defining moment for me. One I will never forget. I can still hear the crowd cheering for us and thought of my fellow refugees in Kakuma, and my family. I took a moment to reflect on everything I had gone through to reach this point and the message we needed to send to the watching world.We were ambassadors of hope at Rio 2016, spreading a message that anything is possible. Today, as the IOC Refugee Olympic Team and the Olympic Refuge Foundation are about to receive the Princess of Asturias Award for Sports, this message has proved to be true. When I was separated from my mother, I wasn’t sure I’d see her again. I wasn’t sure she was alive. It was in Rio that the IOC reunited me with my family. As an Olympian, I spoke to my birth mother for the first time since I was 10 years old. This is the power of sport. This is the value of the Olympic Movement.In Rio, we showed the world that, as refugees, we can do anything. Being a refugee is not the end. For me, with the IOC by my side, it was the start of a new journey.After I returned from running the 800 meter at Rio 2016, the IOC helped me to enroll as a student at Iowa Central Community College in the USA. I was then made a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and appointed by the IOC as Team Leader of the IOC Refugee Olympic Team at Tokyo 2020. I have been able to show more people than ever that there is no shame in being a refugee. That anything is possible.Now that I have also been appointed as an IOC Member and a Board member of the Olympic Refuge Foundation, the IOC continues to strengthen my ability to shine a light on the world’s conflicts, providing me with a vital platform to speak for and with my fellow refugees.In 2005, when I was just 10, government troops came to my village amid the conflict in South Sudan. It was life-changing, but I was one of the lucky ones. I escaped with my mother and brother. We spent three days in the bush, eating only fruits, before being rescued by the UN and finding refuge in Kenya. That is where I got into running and first discovered the power of sport in uniting people.With the support of the Olympic Refuge Foundation – the organization created by the IOC – I recently returned to the refugee camp in Kakuma. I saw my family and advocated that refugees can find belonging through sport and shape their own future. Thanks to the foundation, which has a goal for 1 million young people affected by displacement to access safe sport by 2024, I can now give back to the communities who inspired my own journey.From myself, and on behalf of all refugees around the world, I thank the Princess of Asturias Foundation for this historic recognition. There is no better tool than sport to unite people; in the Kakuma camp, I saw friendships develop between 19 different nationalities. All through the power of sport. And at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, we competed as one in peaceful competition. You never know what tomorrow holds; anyone can be a refugee, but so too can anyone dream and achieve their dreams. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1028/c90000-10164840.html,28,10,2022,"['ioc', 'olympic', 'refugee', 'rio', 'sport', 'foundation', 'team', 'refuge', 'refugees', 'member', 'power', 'mother', 'princess', 'asturias', 'journey', 'kakuma', 'family', 'message', 'yiech', 'pur']",0.5037806637806639,0.18627705627705624,28/10/2022
Much work remains to be done to tackle anti-Asian racism in U.S. - People's Daily Online,"Much work remains to be done to tackle anti-Asian racism in U.S. (Xinhua) 13:29, February 08, 2023People march to protest against anti-Asian hate crimes on Brooklyn Bridge in New York, the United States, April 4, 2021. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- There is still much work to be done in the United States to address deep-rooted hate and discrimination against Asian Americans about one year after multiple deadly cases sending shocking waves across the country.Key initiatives included in the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden in May 2021, have yet to be launched, according to a report by USA TODAY on Tuesday.The legislation was designed to curb anti-Asian hate crimes by creating a position at the Justice Department to expedite a review of COVID-19-related hate crimes; providing grants for states to create hotlines for reporting hate crimes and for law enforcement training aimed at preventing and identifying hate crimes; and directing federal agencies to work with community organizations to help raise awareness about hate crimes during the pandemic.Biden is scheduled to deliver his second State of the Union address on Tuesday evening and it´s not clear if he will mention violence and hate towards the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community as he did in his first State of the Union address.""Racism against Chinese Americans and the AAPI community isn't new. It´s existed in the United States for nearly 200 years, despite the many contributions that Chinese Americans have made to the United States in fields such as healthcare, science, technology, business and the arts,"" said Zhengyu Huang, president of the Committee of 100, a nonprofit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans.People attend a ""Stop Asian Hate"" candlelight vigil in a city park of Alhambra, Los Angeles County, California, the United States, March 20, 2021. (Xinhua)""Chinese Americans are still seen as the perpetual foreigner, strangers in our own homeland. And post COVID, reports of discrimination, racism, and violence towards Americans of Chinese and Asian descent have significantly increased -- and these are only the incidents captured or reported,"" Huang told Xinhua via email in a recent interview.Trigger events like the COVID-19 and irresponsible comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump led to the surge of discrimination against Asian Americans, according to Haipei Shue, president of United Chinese Americans (UCA), a nonpartisan and nonprofit coalition based in Washington, D.C.There have been bias and stereotypes against Asian Americans throughout the history of the United States and the issue of hate against Asian Americans may not be tackled in a short time, said Shue in a recent interview with Xinhua.Shue noted that the stabbing of an Asian student from Indiana University by a white woman on Jan. 11 was apparently racial motivated.""We are a nation of immigrants with a history of discrimination and exploitation of minority groups. We are still learning from the mistakes of the past. Asian Americans have contributed mightily to the success of the United States but there is still much work to be done to treat Asian Americans as Americans,"" said Huang.The fight against racist words and actions of certain politicians and leaders towards the Asian American community as well as long-held stereotypes is staged on a daily basis, Huang added.People rally to protest against anti-Asian hate crimes on Foley Square in New York, the United States, April 4, 2021. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)Though progresses were made in the fight against discrimination in the past decades in the United States, it´s surprising to see how fast setbacks took place in recent years, said Shue.The education system and literature in the United States don't talk much about the original sin of racial discrimination in U.S. history, Shue noted.Michelle Alyssa Go´s death was a call to action for many, including those who see the crime Martial Simon committed as an example of ongoing anti-Asian hate, said Michelle´s father Justin Go in a recent piece run by The New York Times on the anniversary of her death.Michelle Alyssa Go was shoved to her death by homeless man Martial Simon on Jan. 15, 2022 at the subway station in Times Square.It has been sad and physically exhausting to constantly hear and see the never ending strident voices spewing hatred over social media, said Justin Go.People attend a ""Stop Asian Hate"" candlelight vigil in a city park of Alhambra, Los Angeles County, California, the United States, March 20, 2021. (Xinhua)""Whatever freedoms we give to people, possessing such personal rights does not mean we can abandon people like Martial Simon to our subway systems,"" said Justin Go, who acknowledged progress has been made to help homeless people in New York.Everybody in the neighborhood was a little bit traumatized just from everything that went in 2022, said Brian Chin, a resident in Chinatown in Lower Manhattan.Chin is the former landlord of Korean-American woman Christina Yuna Lee, who was stalked and stabbed to death by homeless man Assamad Nash in her apartment on Feb. 13, 2022.The hate and discrimination against Asian Americans still is a problem and there still seems to be a lot of hatred, Chin told Xinhua in a recent interview.""Hopefully, 2023 is better, but 2022 at least was a very bad year for all Asians... It seems like there´s more and more hate crimes in New York City happening against Asians every week.

"China key contributor to global and regional peace, stability, development -- Cambodian academics - People's Daily Online","China key contributor to global and regional peace, stability, development -- Cambodian academics (Xinhua) 11:19, June 12, 2022PHNOM PENH, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has been playing an important role in maintaining global and regional peace, security, stability and development, Cambodian academics have said.Their comments were made on Friday as the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue, a premier defense and security summit in the Asia-Pacific region, is being held in Singapore after a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said China always upholds a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.He said China urges the world to discard Cold War and zero-sum mentalities, rejects the law of the jungle, and encourages the settlement of conflicts through peaceful ways.""China has been playing a more important role in safeguarding global and regional peace and stability,"" he told Xinhua.Phea said that in his observation, China has never invaded other countries or engaged in proxy wars, nor has it ever sought spheres of influence or participated in military bloc confrontations.The academic said China always stays committed to the path of peaceful development and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.""I notice that China firmly opposes all hegemonies and power politics and resolutely upholds the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, especially small and medium-sized countries,"" he said.Seun Sam, a policy analyst at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said that China believes in peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and praised China´s concept of global, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.""China does not only want to grow alone but also wants other countries to grow with it,"" Sam said. ""We can say that China wants to grow with other countries.""Unlike the United States, China´s vision is to transform the region into a hub of peace, stability and development through digital connectivity and infrastructure development, said Joseph Matthews, senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh.He said China´s vision of global development through the Belt and Road Initiative, ""green Silk Road,"" and ""digital Silk Road"" strategies has helped the region attract investors from all over the world.""In contrast to China´s vision, the USA and its allies in the region are trying to trigger a conventional and non-conventional arms race after having created the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the U.S., Japan, Australia and India (QUAD) and the military pact among the U.S., Britain and Australia (AUKUS), which are true replicas of NATO in Asia and the Asia-Pacific region,"" Matthews said.""The USA strategy in the region has directly threatened the centrality of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which is the soul and spirit of the bloc,"" he added.Apart from these NATO-like security alliances, last month during the QUAD summit conference in Tokyo, U.S. President Joe Biden announced the creation of the so-called Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which is neither a free trade agreement nor even a trade agreement.Calling the IPEF ""a symbolic agreement that will not affect regional economic and social development at all,"" he said ""the USA has created this group to counter China´s influence in the region and the ulterior motive for the creation of IPEF is to divide the ASEAN."" ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0612/c90000-10108591.html,12,6,2022,"['china', 'development', 'region', 'security', 'global', 'countries', 'regional', 'peace', 'stability', 'vision', 'asia', 'pacific', 'peaceful', 'grow', 'road', 'usa', 'ipef', 'agreement', 'cambodian', 'academics']",0.3357433217189315,0.026596980255516843,12/6/2022
Power of long-term investment opportunities - People's Daily Online,"Power of long-term investment opportunitiesBy SHI JING (China Daily) 11:10, October 17, 2022Visitors check the exhibition booth of Standard Chartered during an expo in Shanghai. Standard Chartered Hong Kong has applied to establish a wholly owned securities company in the Chinese mainland. [PHOTO by WU JUN/FOR CHINA DAILY]Foreign players make a beeline for China´s capital market, financial services industryChina´s higher-level opening-up and reform of caps on business ownership are producing rich dividends for the country´s financial services industry in general and the capital market in particular, experts said.More foreign entities like securities brokerages and investment banks are expanding their global footprint into China even as Chinese companies tap foreign bourses for additional funds. All this is causing a healthy trend in two-way capital flows, besides boosting related market segments like derivatives. What is more, existing foreign players in China are increasing their financial product portfolios, they said.There is good reason for foreign firms to do so, market mavens said, underlining that in the current fraught global scenario, the Chinese market represents a solid opportunity to earn decent returns on big-ticket investments.Take Bridgewater Associates, for instance. In the first half of this year, the world´s biggest hedge fund notched up an impressive 4.76 percent gains on its investments in China´s stock market. What makes Bridgewater´s performance outstanding is that during the same period, the local benchmark, the Shanghai Composite Index, shed as much as 6.63 percent, with comparable global indexes abroad not faring much better either.Small wonder, foreign players are making a beeline for a slice of the Chinese market pie. Their rush coincides with the larger trend of the deepening of financial reform and opening-up, which is also expected to facilitate the renminbi´s internationalization and enhance China´s influence on commodity pricing.On Sept 15, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country´s top securities watchdog, accepted an application from Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy´s largest banking group by total assets, to set up a foreign-controlled securities brokerage in China.If the application proves successful, the proposed joint-venture securities firm would be set up in Qingdao of East China´s Shandong province. Intesa Sanpaolo will take a 51 percent stake while the rest will be shared by three local companies.Intesa Sanpaolo is tipped to emerge as the 10th foreign financial institution to set up a securities brokerage with a controlling stake in China.Many other foreign players are lining up for a piece of action in China. Among them are well-known names such as Standard Chartered, SMBC Nikko Securities and BNP Paribas, all of whom have submitted similar applications earlier and are awaiting CSRC approval.For foreign players yet to get a taste of the China market, Bridgewater has been a revelation. The latter´s new product, launched in a low-key manner in association with local partner CITIC Securities in June, sold like hot cakes among investors. Its 200 million yuan ($27.85 million) quota sold out instantly.Investors in China, market experts said, have taken a shine to Bridgewater´s overall eye-catching performance in the first half of the year, led by its multi-asset, all-weather portfolio.In an online forum in May, Ray Dalio, Bridgewater´s founder, expressed confidence in the investment outlook in China. Given the relatively lower asset prices in China at present, long-term investment opportunities are implied here, he said.Similarly, in early August, Black-Rock, the world´s largest asset manager, released a new product focusing on advanced manufacturing companies listed on the A-share market. It is the industry giant´s third such product in China since its emergence in June 2021 as the country´s first wholly foreign-owned mutual fund company.""The launch of BlackRock´s wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China, and the release of (its financial) products, can prove to overseas financial institutions the effectiveness of the continued opening-up in the Chinese capital market. The Chinese government is willing to facilitate foreign institutions' access to China by rolling out necessary policies and making necessary resources available. Entry into China is sure to prove a success under such circumstances,"" said Zhang Chi, general manager of BlackRock Fund Management Co.Many experts agree that the deepening of the opening-up policy has not slackened in spite of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases this year.For instance, on July 4, trading via exchange-traded funds — ETFs — under the stock connect mechanism between Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong commenced officially. Chinese mainland investors thus gained access to four ETFs listed on the Hong Kong bourse while 83 ETFs listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges became available to international investors via the northbound leg of the connect programs.As of Sept 1, about 1.04 billion yuan worth of trading was completed under the northbound leg of the ETF connect, while the trading value under the southbound leg was HK$12.5 billion ($1.59 billion).Abby Wang, head of China asset management for KPMG in China, said the inclusion of ETFs in the connect programs is another major landmark in the high-level two-way opening-up of the Chinese capital market.The connect programs, which started by linking the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Hong Kong in 2014, have been extended to the London Stock Exchange in 2019.This has facilitated Chinese companies to issue global depositary receipts or GDRs on the Frankfurt and Zurich bourses in February as per the CSRC´s latest guidance.In less than half-year, as many as six A-share companies have issued GDRs successfully on the SIX Swiss Exchange.The expanded scope of the connect programs is another breakthrough in the Chinese capital market´s opening-up, as it succeeded in attracting resources from all over the world, said Tian Xuan, associate dean of Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance.Apart from the traditional equities sector, China´s financial opening-up has been extended to derivatives trading. On Sept 5, the CSRC announced that Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors and Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors can trade in 23 designated commodity futures, 16 option contracts and stock option contracts in China.This move was highly anticipated as part of the opening-up policy, said Luo Xufeng, chairman of Nanhua Futures, adding it will facilitate the renminbi´s internationalization and strengthen China´s say on prices in the global commodity markets, which have been rocked by geopolitical tensions for much of this year.Besides capital markets, China´s larger financial services industry has been a beneficiary of the process of deepening opening-up. China has lifted the ownership limits on securities firms, banks and insurance companies.China´s top banking and insurance regulator approved the establishment of over 120 foreign banking and insurance institutions in China between 2018 and 2021. Another 11 foreign banking institutions opened in China last year, with 929 foreign banking institutions operating in all. Their total net profit approached 21.28 billion yuan in 2021, up nearly 25 percent year-on-year, said the China Banking Association.China Economic Information Service calculated that Shanghai was home to 1,707 licensed financial institutions last year. The total number of financial institutions in the city exceeded 10,000, of which foreign financial institutions accounted for 30 percent.Consequently, competition has stiffened and investment strategies have diversified, adding both width and depth to the market.The change in investment style can be seen in the faster shifts this year in the direction of northbound capital — the funds overseas investors use to buy into the A-share market via stock connect programs.While northbound capital reported a net inflow of 74.2 billion yuan in June, the scene changed to a net outflow of 21 billion yuan in July. One month later, another U-turn led to a net inflow of 12.7 billion yuan.Wang Chunying, deputy head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said short-term volatility in cross-border securities investment can be seen globally. It is quite normal for an increasingly open financial market like China to experience such volatility, she said.Overall, northbound capital reported a net inflow of 52.2 billion yuan in the first nine months of this year, CSRC data showed. As of Aug 26, overseas investors invested nearly 21.3 billion yuan in international futures products like yuan-denominated crude oil futures.At the China International Finance Annual Forum 2022 held in early September, CSRC Vice-Chairman Fang Xinghai said foreign investment in the Chinese capital market has shown strong resilience over the past few months. The continued inflow of foreign capital has confirmed international institutions' confidence in China´s long-term economic growth.At Nomura´s 14th China Investor Forum earlier this year, Toshiyasu Iiyama, executive managing director of Nomura Holdings Inc and chairman of its China committee, said they are preparing to apply for an investment banking license in China, a business line that will be the next focus for the Japanese securities company.""The best is still ahead of us as we steadily increase our presence and build a sustainable business in China. We are optimistic about growth prospects for the market and our business as we support financial sector reforms and the opening up of the financial market,"" he said.BlackRock attends an expo in Munich on October 5.

"Cloud of suspicion hangs over Europe on Nord Stream leaks, risks escalating Ukraine crisis, causing greater pains for Europeans amid energy crisis - People's Daily Online","Cloud of suspicion hangs over Europe on Nord Stream leaks, risks escalating Ukraine crisis, causing greater pains for Europeans amid energy crisisBy Chen Qingqing, Chu Daye and Bai Yunyi (Global Times) 08:29, September 29, 2022As countries rushed to speculate causes behind unusual leaks of the Nord Stream pipelines from Russia to Europe, with some blaming Russia while others alluding to the involvement of the US and its allies, Chinese observers warned of the ripple effects on the Ukraine crisis and the global energy market.Although the leaks in these two gas pipelines running from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany had no immediate effect on European energy supplies, Chinese observers say it will deliver a heavy blow to some European countries such as Germany that are heading into a cold winter in the throes of an energy crisis, cause more turbulences in global energy prices and further exacerbate the West´s hostility toward Russia.Such an unusual incident could trigger a ripple effect, add more realistic risks to the Ukraine crisis and make the wrestling among major powers dash into dangerous uncertainties, they warned.The EU´s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Wednesday that the EU considers the leaks from the Nord Stream 1 and 2 ""not a coincidence,"" which are the result of a deliberate act, according to media reports. The latest remark came out after Denmark´s armed forces released a video on Tuesday which showed bubbles rushing to the surface of the Baltic Sea above the pipelines as the two undersea leaks began on Monday.Countries including Denmark, Germany and Poland warned of ""sabotage"" after Nord Stream leaks, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, as the two pipelines have been at the center of the energy tussle between Russia and Europe since Russia´s military operation in Ukraine. It also cited Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine´s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who pointed out that the leaks are ""nothing more than a terrorist attack planned by Russia and an act of aggression toward the EU.""Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not rule out that disruptions in the operation of the two pipelines could be sabotaged, TASS reported on Tuesday. He stressed that ""certainly, this is an issue related to the energy security of the entire continent.""However, a former Polish Defense Minister Radek Sikorski attributed the sabotage to the US by saying in a Tweet ""Thank you, USA.""The Nord Stream pipelines leaks occurred at an extremely sensitive time. It happened on the final day of referenda on ""joining Russia"" in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine.And it´s noted that the pipelines leaks also coincided with the inauguration of a pipeline that will deliver gas from Norway through Denmark to Poland for the first time, the FT said.A video clip of the US President Joe Biden who promised in February to prevent Nord Stream 2 from operating if Russia began its military operation in Ukraine also went viral on social media on Wednesday. ""If Russia invades, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.""With the European leaders supporting an investigation on the leaks, Chinese observers said the incident could become a forever mystery given the interests of various parties involved. While some observers said the US should be the one to blame, the possibility of some intelligence agencies or regional command offices involved can't be ruled out as the incident will weaken the role of Russian energy in the European market and complicate the Russia-Ukraine crisis, leading the already-struggling European countries to face a more miserable winter.Possible scenariosIf Russia hopes to cut off the gas supplies to Europe, the easiest way is to turn off the valve instead of blowing its own pipelines, as Moscow could maintain the advantage of handling the energy crisis, Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""Technically, Russia sabotaging the pipelines in the Baltic Sea appears to be not feasible,"" he said. As undersea activities in the Baltic Sea have been dominated by NATO members or allies since the Cold War with monitoring devices toward then Soviet Union and now Russia, how could Moscow explode the pipelines easily, which in fact is not a favorable thing for itself, Shen asked.There are increasing signs of a planned attack on the two Nord Stream gas pipelines, German news outlet Der Spiegel said on Wednesday, as there were already indications of this from the CIA of the US in advance.US security advisor Jake Sullivan said in a Tweet on Wednesday that he spoke to his Danish counterpart about ""the apparent sabotage"" of the pipelines, saying that ""the US is supporting efforts to investigate and we will continue our work to safeguard Europe´s energy security.""""Who want to sabotage the Russia-EU energy cooperation? The answer is pretty clear,"" Ming Jinwei, a former journalist and blogger, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The US can achieve three goals: striking Russia´s energy export to attack its overall economic and financial revenues, to limit Europe´s energy supplies and make it buy more crude oil and gas from the US with higher prices and to strictly control the lifeblood of European countries, he said.The apparent attack had no immediate effect on European energy supplies, as Nord Stream 2 has never gone into service, and Nord Stream 1 has been shut down since August. But it raises the stakes — and European jitters — in a simmering energy war between Russia and the West, the New York Times said.If the US is behind the incident, such act of blatantly cutting off the energy supplies to Europe risks jeopardizing its relations with its allies such as Germany, and some experts said there are possible scenarios that intelligence agencies and its European command office plotted the leaks. Some also suggested that anti-Russia forces or organizations may collude with the US in order to launch a new round of anti-Russia chorus at the global stage.Attacking the undersea gas pipelines can't be accomplished without the promise or manipulation of relevant governments or major powers, which is a very dangerous trend and brings the intensity of the great power wrestling into dangerous uncertainty, Wang Xiaoquan, an expert from the Institute of Russian, East European and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""The incident will certainly further complicate the situation in Europe. It may be difficult to find out the real cause of the incident in the short term,"" he said.""Whatever the truth, all parties will surely use the event to achieve their own political purposes. Many European countries are already accusing Russia in order to launch a new round of anti-Russian chorus,"" Wang said, noting that even if Russia investigates the truth and shows relevant evidence, it will be difficult to argue back because it does not have that international collective voice.Sow chaosEurope has dethroned Asia as the biggest destination for US liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the energy-starved region seeks to slash its dependence on Russian supplies, Bloomberg said in June, as the US sent nearly three quarters of all its liquefied natural gas to Europe in the first four months of 2022, with daily shipments to the region more than tripling from last year´s average.The US, while supplying the EU, was reaping the benefits of higher gas prices, and it is also possible that some US companies may buy Russia-originated gas, liquefy it, and sell it to European buyers for a profit, Jin Lei, a professor with China University of Petroleum, told the Global Times on Wednesday.For Europe to cut its reliance on Russian natural gas right away, the challenge is huge, Jin said, noting that finding replacement within a short period of time would be very difficult.With the visits by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to Gulf countries lately, the German government has sought out new natural gas suppliers. At home, it was also installing terminals to bring the fuel into the country by ship.Yet, it would be nearly impossible for such efforts to be translated into concrete results by this winter, Jin said.The price of gas in Europe went up by 12 percent reaching almost $1,950 per 1,000 cubic meters during Tuesday trading, showed data provided by London´s ICE, according to media reports.Some experts believe the incident will further disrupt the global energy prices as international markets could push up energy prices on fears that non-market factors such as terrorist attacks could undermine Russia´s energy supply.""This will deliver a heavy blow to countries like Germany on its economy and livelihoods. As the energy prices go up, a huge number of enterprises will face bankruptcy and people will suffer in the cold winter,"" Wang said, noting that this could lead to social turmoil, raising possibilities for external interference.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0929/c90000-10153134.html,29,9,2022,"['russia', 'energy', 'pipelines', 'gas', 'european', 'europe', 'leaks', 'nord', 'stream', 'global', 'wednesday', 'ukraine', 'countries', 'times', 'incident', 'crisis', 'supplies', 'prices', 'germany', 'eu']",0.38404932259098906,0.03224466891133558,29/9/2022

They get to the heart of U.S. foreign policy, one that features meddling in the internal affairs of other countries and subverting their governance, with the ultimate aim of securing American hegemony.Such an interventionist foreign policy has prompted scenes of woe and horror worldwide and seriously jeopardized global peace and stability.Protesters gather in front of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq on Dec. 31, 2019 to condemn airstrikes by the U.S. forces against Hashd Shaabi bases in Iraq. (Xinhua/Khalil Dawood)TRAILS OF BLOODSHEDIn the spring of 1805, U.S. army officer and diplomatic consul William Eaton, in alliance with Hamet Karamanli, the deposed brother of Yusuf Karamanli, Pasha of Tripolitania, or today´s Libya, marched an army to attack Derna. They easily captured the Tripolitanian city with the help of three U.S. ships, and the Pasha was forced to capitulate.The incident, which led to the end of the First Barbary War and a victorious United States, has been viewed by many scholars as the first U.S. attempt at a coup d'etat in a foreign government through military interventionism, triggering the country´s consequent pursuit of global domination.Since then, the United States has launched more bloody overseas military intrusions, often swooping in on a country and launching deadly attacks until the target is thrown into chaos and its government overthrown.From the end of World War II to 2001, the United States has initiated 201 armed conflicts in 153 locations, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total wars that occurred across the world in that time. Since 2001, Washington and its allies have dropped an estimated average of 46 bombs on other countries daily.Those wars, mainly in the name of ""democracy,"" ""freedom"" and ""human rights"" were instead a reckless interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, leaving behind death and destruction in the Middle East, Latin America and Eastern Europe.For example, U.S.-led NATO forces carried out continuous airstrikes for 78 days against Yugoslavia. The result? More than 8,000 civilians dead or injured and nearly 1 million displaced.The U.S.-launched war in Afghanistan killed around 50,000 Afghan civilians from 2001 to mid-April 2020 and reduced some 11 million to refugees. Furthermore, years of bloodshed have left more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians dead and dragged Libya into greater turmoil.The United States is ""the most warlike nation in the history of the world,"" former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said in 2019, adding his country had only enjoyed 16 years of peace in its 242-year history.The U.S. history of looting ""is associated with numerous military interventions and the organizations of coups to eliminate those governments that did not easily accede to their demands,"" Gilberto Valdes Gutierrez of the Cuban Institute of Philosophy told Xinhua.U.S. historian Paul L.

In Latin America, it continues to meddle in the domestic affairs of regional countries under the ""Monroe Doctrine.""Washington´s sanctions have increased tenfold in the past 20 years. It has long put Cuba, Venezuela, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria and others on its blacklist, wantonly disrupting their economies and damaging people´s livelihoods, even amid the COVID-19 pandemic.In an interview with USA Today in September 2020, political scientist Dov H. Levin noted that the United States has intervened in 81 elections between 1946 and 2000, including those in Yugoslavia and Italy.An article published by Foreign Affairs in June 2020 said the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency´s first known covert action was to manipulate Italy´s 1948 election by spreading incendiary propaganda, bankrolling their preferred candidate and orchestrating grassroots initiatives -- ""all to advantage Italy´s centrist forces over their leftist competitors.""The United States has financed non-governmental organizations ""that essentially are there to destabilize countries,"" said Alfred de Zayas, professor of international law at the Geneva School of Diplomacy, who, as an American, feels ""vicariously responsible"" for the misdeeds of his country.Photo taken on Sept. 2, 2021 shows damaged vehicles at the site of the U.S. airstrike in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan. (Photo by Saifurahman Safi/Xinhua)ARROGANCE NEVER DIES""A modern form of 'Western arrogance"" is how Greg Cusack, former member of the Iowa House of Representatives, described his country´s foreign policy in an interview with Xinhua.He was right: From the beginning of its founding, the United States has formed a culture of piracy that advocates pillage and conquest. Later, as triumphalism reared its head in the West following the end of the Cold War, the United States, the world´s sole superpower, saw a rare opportunity to reshape the globe as it saw fit and rule supreme.But its ""unipolar moment"" was short-lived. As the world shifts towards a multipolar one, the United States fears its global supremacy is weakening and has therefore started tightening its grip.""Washington´s empire"" is ""built on foundations of greed and lust for power,"" writer and political commentator John Wight wrote in an opinion published in July.Its ""imperial arrogance"" is the same as that accompanying any empire, ""established in the name not of peace and prosperity, but of war and exploitation,"" Wight wrote, adding the United States ""seeks to dominate"" and ""has a policy of interfering in other states' internal affairs.""Indeed, the United States has long undermined international rules, coerced others to pick sides and retaliated against those who refused to comply. The consequences have extended beyond the human losses, economic collapses and social turmoil of targeted states to shatter regional and global stability.And to justify its interventionist policy, the United States has masqueraded its misdeeds as ""just war theory"" and so-called ""democratic experiments.""Daniel Kovalik, an American expert on international human rights from the University of Pittsburgh, told Xinhua that the United States uses human rights as a ""bludgeon"" against targets.It has nothing to do with human rights, he said. ""It´s about U.S. economic and strategic interests.""""The discourse about democracy is the U.S. tool of pressure on countries ... Every region they invaded was completely destroyed both physically and spiritually as they set neighbors against one another,"" said veteran Turkish journalist Tunc Akkoc.As an op-ed published last year in the South China Morning Post read, the United States ""delivers all the consequences that a hegemon can inflict upon non-compliant states.""The ""different experiences of U.S. interventions"" over the past decades ""were not in favor of the peoples,"" Egyptian political expert Akram Hossam told Xinhua.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0812/c90000-10134355.html,12,8,2022,"['states', 'united', 'countries', 'war', 'american', 'foreign', 'policy', 'global', 'human', 'political', 'peace', 'military', 'economic', 'affairs', 'country', 'stability', 'end', 'wrote', 'years', 'rights']",0.2839444868856636,0.002184396485867074,12/8/2022

China collects two gold medals on 4th day of FINA Worlds - People's Daily Online,"China collects two gold medals on 4th day of FINA Worlds (Xinhua) 10:22, June 22, 2022BUDAPEST, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese swimmers grabbed their chances on the fourth day of the 19th FINA World Championships, winning a historic gold in artistic swimming, another gold and a bronze medal in the women´s 200m freestyle here on Tuesday.China´s Yang Junxuan won the 200m race with a time of one minute and 54.92 seconds, while her 18-year-old teammate Tang Muhan took the bronze medal with 1:56.25.

Reality Check: Falsehoods in US Perceptions of China - People's Daily Online,"Reality Check: Falsehoods in US Perceptions of China (People´s Daily Online) 08:42, June 20, 2022IntroductionUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has recently delivered a speech at Asia Society outlining the US administration’s approach to China. With carefully calibrated language, he sought to promote the “China threat” narrative, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and smear China’s domestic and foreign policy, all in an attempt at full-blown containment and suppression of China.In what is to follow, we will use facts and figures to show to the world how deceptive, hypocritical and dangerous the US’s China policy is.Falsehood 1: China poses the most serious long-term challenge to the international order and is undermining it. The US will defend the international law, agreements, principles, and institutions that maintain peace and security, and protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations.Reality Check: What the US has constantly vowed to preserve is a so-called international order designed to serve the US’s own interests and perpetuate its hegemony. The US itself is the largest source of disruption to the actual world order.◆ China has been and always will be a defender of the international order. China is a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and the first country to put its signature on the UN Charter. China is committed to upholding the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations built on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly championed by China, India and Myanmar have been widely recognized by the international community and have become the basic norms guiding state-to-state relations.China upholds true multilateralism and global strategic stability. China is the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the UN Security Council and the second largest contributor among all countries to the UN peacekeeping budget. China has taken an active part in international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation processes. It has signed or acceded to more than 20 multilateral arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). China is against arms race.In the wake of the international financial crisis of 2008, China adopted a responsible macro policy, remained a “stabilizer” for the world economy and made important contribution to global recovery. China actively provides international public goods to various countries, and has signed BRI cooperation agreements with 149 countries and 32 international organizations.◆ In recent years, President Xi Jinping’s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind has been warmly received by the international community. It has been written into multiple important documents issued by the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other multilateral institutions. UN Secretary-General António Guterres hailed China as an important pillar for multilateralism, noting that the purpose for practicing multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Peter Thomson, president of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly, said the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind advocated by China is the only future for humanity on this planet.In response to various new global challenges, President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). They represent China’s proposals for making the global governance system fairer and more equitable, and have received positive response and wide support from the international community.◆ The US has blatantly violated the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the norms governing international relations. With its military might, the US has launched wars in numerous parts of the world, stoking divisions and conflicts and bringing huge turmoil and disaster to the world. Throughout the 240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years in which the US was not at war. The US might as well be called the most belligerent country in the history of the world. US magazine The National Interest quoted Dakota Wood, senior research fellow for defense programs at the Heritage Foundation, who wrote that the US consistently needed to deploy military force every 15 years or so.Since the end of World War II, the United States has either launched or participated in many wars overseas, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Afghan War and the Iraq War. Those wars caused extremely severe civilian casualties and property losses, and lead to colossal humanitarian disasters. Since 2001, US wars and military operations in the name of counterterrorism have killed more than 900,000 people, about 335,000 of whom were civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions.◆ The US habitually puts its domestic law above the international law, and selectively applies international rules as it sees fit. Since the 1980s, the US had once withdrawn from 17 international organizations and treaties, including the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Paris Agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the Treaty on Open Skies.Although the current US administration declared that “America is back” and the US has rejoined some international organizations and agreements, the administration has in essence not abandoned the “America First” policy, and is advancing “selective multilateralism”. The current administration has stayed out of institutions and agreements considered harmful to US interests such as the Treaty on Open Skies. European media have described it as “America First 2.0”.◆ The US has abused its financial hegemony and technological clout and engaged in economic coercion in the name of protecting national security. The US has enacted some domestic laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and issued a series of executive orders to target and sanction specific countries, entities or individuals. The ambiguous rules contained in these acts and executive orders, such as the “minimum contacts principle” and “doctrine of effects”, are a willful expansion of the jurisdiction of US domestic laws. The US also abuses its domestic channels of prosecution to exercise long-arm jurisdiction over entities and individuals in other countries.For more than 60 years, in total disregard of the many resolutions of the UN General Assembly, the US has continued its comprehensive blockade against Cuba based on its embargo policies and domestic laws such as the Torricelli Act and the Helms-Burton Act. The Cuba blockade is the longest and cruelest systemic trade embargo, economic blockade and financial sanctions in modern history. The blockade has been gravely detrimental to Cuba’s economic and social development, causing over 100 billion US dollars of direct losses to Cuba’s economy.The US has carried out blockade and sanctions against Iran since late 1970s. In May 2018, the US government announced its unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, and soon after resumed and expanded sanctions against Iran. Many countries and relevant entities have been forced to give up their cooperation with Iran. A large number of foreign oil enterprises left the country. Iran’s manufacturing industry can hardly sustain normal operation. The country has suffered economic slowdown, coupled with heightened inflation and massive currency depreciation.The US has imposed unilateral sanctions on Belarus, Syria and Zimbabwe, among others, over the years, and ratcheted up “maximum pressure” against the DPRK, Venezuela, etc.◆ Statistics show that the previous US administration had imposed over 3,900 sanction measures, which means it wielded its “big stick” three times a day on average. As of fiscal year 2021, the entities and individuals on US sanction lists topped 9,421, which was 933 percent higher compared to the fiscal year 2000.The US’s illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have gravely undermined the sovereignty and security of other countries and severely impacted their economic development and people’s wellbeing. The sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction also constitute a gross violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.In an article published in the September/October 2021 issue of Foreign Affairs, Daniel Drezner, Professor at Tufts University and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, criticizes successive US administrations for using “sanctions as the go-to solution for nearly every foreign policy problem.” He notes that sanctions not only are ineffective, but also “exert a humanitarian toll”, and that the United States of America has become the “United States of Sanctions”.◆ The “rules-based international order” championed by the US is in fact another version of power politics. This is an attempt to impose one’s own will and standards on others, and to replace the commonly accepted international laws and norms with the house rules of a few countries.In the world, there is only one international system, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core. There is only one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law. And there is only one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.Before wanting to discuss rules and order, the US should first pay up its arrears of one billion US dollars for the UN’s regular budget and 1.4 billion US dollars peacekeeping assessments, ratify in a timely manner the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, stop single-handedly blocking the negotiations on a verification protocol under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), lift illegal unilateral sanctions, earnestly fulfill its international obligations and set a good example for others in respecting laws and norms.Falsehood 2: The US is not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. It doesn’t seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop China from growing its economy or advancing the interests of its people.Reality Check: Despite its claims that it doesn’t seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop it from growing its economy, the US is actually deploying its domestic and external resources to unscrupulously contain and suppress China .◆ Without producing any credible evidence, the US government uses national security as a catch-all pretext and all its apparatus to wantonly suppress and sanction Huawei, restricting its products’ entry into the US market, cutting off its access to chips and operating system, and coercing countries around the world into banning Huawei from their 5G rollout. The US also orchestrated and pressured Canada to hold Huawei’s CFO for nearly three years without cause.◆ In violation of the principle of fair competition and market economy and international trading rules, the US seeks to hamstring competitive Chinese hi-tech companies under all kinds of trumped-up charges. To date, it has placed over 1,000 Chinese companies on various sanctions lists, subjected biotechnology and artificial intelligence technologies to enhanced export controls and stringent investment review, and sought to ban Chinese social media platforms including TikTok and WeChat.◆ Under the pretext of protecting human rights, the US has fabricated misinformation and disinformation concerning Xinjiang such as the existence of “forced labor” and, on the basis of those unfounded stories, has adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act which maliciously targets Xinjiang’s competitive cotton, tomatoes and solar photovoltaic sectors to contain China’s growth. This has disrupted the international trade order and destabilized global industrial and supply chains.◆ The previous US administration, in grave violation of WTO rules, waged a massive trade war on China. Based on its own Section 301 investigation, it imposed three rounds of steep tariffs on about 360 billion US dollars’ worth of Chinese imports. In September 2021, the current US administration initiated a Section 232 investigation to determine the effects on US national security from imports of neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets at a time when global commodity prices were hovering at elevated levels.◆ The US has a record of grossly interfering in China’s domestic affairs on issues concerning China’s core interests, including Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. It seeks to undermine China’s security and stability by, both overtly and covertly, condoning and supporting separatist activities.◆ The bipartisan innovation bills being debated in the US Congress, while professing to enhance US competitiveness, see China as a perceived rival. “China” appears more than 800 times in the text, which is packed with provisions detrimental to China’s interests.◆ In a bid to maintain its power and predominance in international institutions, the US has attempted to smear and block the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and the initiative of advancing Belt and Road cooperation, among others, in multilateral fora and also to remove references to them in UN and other international documents.◆ Clinging to a Cold War mentality and the hegemon’s logic, the US pursues bloc politics, concocts the “democracy versus authoritarianism” narrative, cajoles other countries into forming exclusive cliques, strengthens the Five Eyes, peddles the Quad mechanism, puts together AUKUS with the UK and Australia and ramps up bilateral military alliances, in a clear attempt at countering China.◆ The US pushes NATO to insert itself in Asia-Pacific affairs, fan the “China threat” narrative in the bloc’s new strategic concept, and include in its Madrid Summit such US allies in the Asia-Pacific as Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Australia, in a bid to build an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO”, which would disrupt security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.◆ The development of state-to-state relations should be based on equality, mutual respect and win-win results. China-US relations have reached an important crossroads. The US should stop viewing this relationship through a Cold War, zero-sum mindset, follow the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and reflect in its action the five assurances it has made to China (i.e. the US does not seek a new Cold War with China, the US does not seek to change China’s system, the revitalization of US alliances is not against China, the US does not support “Taiwan independence”, and the US is not looking for conflict with China) .Falsehood 3: Our diplomacy is based on partnership and respect for each other’s interests, while China practices coercive diplomacy against other countries and retaliates recklessly. Our task is to prove once again that all countries will be free to chart their own paths without coercion.Reality Check: It is the US that invented “coercive diplomacy” and excels at coercing countries. Over the years, by imposing economic blockade, unilateral sanctions and other means, the US has practiced coercive diplomacy around the world with textbook examples.◆ In 1971, American scholar Alexander George first put forward the concept of “coercive diplomacy” to summarize the US policy toward Laos, Cuba and Vietnam at that time. The US government forced the military government of Haiti to step down in 1994, and referred to that as “a textbook example of coercive diplomacy”. In 2003, it explicitly characterized 30.3 billion US dollars additional military expenses for “coercive diplomacy” as incurred expenses.The US government froze seven billion US dollars assets of the Afghan central bank on the grounds of punishing the Afghan Taliban and even claimed the “life-saving money” of the Afghan people as its own, which resulted in the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Mohammad Naeem, spokesman of the Taliban Political Office in Doha, said the seizure is “indicative of the lowest level of human and moral decay of a country and a nation”.In order to force the Nepalese parliament to approve the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) agreement, the US openly issued an “ultimatum”, saying that the US will review its ties with Nepal if it fails to ratify the compact.After the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, the US Justice Department established the “Task Force KleptoCapture” to find, freeze and seize the yachts, apartments, private jets and huge deposits of Russian citizens in the US and Europe. This fully shows that the US-touted “inviolable and sacred right to property” is just a lie. The US has forced other countries to pick sides and pressured them to join sanctions against Russia. And those who refuse to do so will pay a “price”.After China and the Solomon Islands had signed a framework agreement on bilateral security cooperation, the US sent senior officials of the National Security Council to the country, doing whatever it can to obstruct the legitimate cooperation between China and Solomon Islands. A Solomn Star article pointed out, “Washington DC, which has literally forgotten Solomon Islands since World War II, has finally woken up and is applying the heat on the Solomon Islands to abandon the security pact.”In May 2022, on the eve of the High-Level Virtual Meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI, the US exerted pressure on multiple UN development agencies to obstruct their attendance and threatened to “cut funding”.◆ The “Clean Network” program launched by the previous administration is another textbook example of US coercive diplomacy. Under the pretext of upholding US national security and citizens’ privacy, the program explicitly requires that Chinese companies such as Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba to be purged from five areas: telecom operators, mobile app stores, mobile apps, cloud services and submarine optical cables. The then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other US politicians lobbied all around the world, coercing countries and regions to join its so-called “Network”. A US senior official even threatened Cyprus and other countries not to work with Chinese 5G suppliers, or they would bear the consequence. Former UK Business and Industry Minister Vince Cable said the government’s decision to ban Huawei’s 5G equipment and services “had nothing to do with national security”, and was because “the Americans told us we should do it”.◆ The US shows no mercy in coercing its allies. Out of its geopolitical and energy interests considerations, the US has imposed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project since December 2019. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has imposed new sanctions on related companies and personnel even though Germany had announced the suspension of the certification process for the project.◆ A US scholar pointed out that American foreign policy since World War II has been based on a simple idea: “Either you are with us or against us. America should lead, allies should follow, and woe be to countries that oppose its primacy”. His words lay bare the nature of US coercive diplomacy.◆ China never engages in coercive diplomacy and firmly opposes coercive diplomacy by other countries. China never threatens other countries with force, never creates military alliance, never exports ideology, never meddles in others’ domestic affairs, never seeks a trade war, and never imposes unjustified oppression on foreign enterprises. That said, however, China has the right to make necessary and legitimate responses to actions that undermine China’s sovereignty, security and development rights and interests.Falsehood 4: The US democracy is one of the most powerful assets in this contest. Our task is to prove once again that democracy can meet urgent challenges and that the future belongs to those who believe in freedom.Reality Check: The US sets standards for democracy after its own system, does not allow other systems, paths and models to exist, and gangs up with others to wantonly interfere in other countries’ internal affairs in the name of democracy. This not just contravenes the spirit of democracy, but also spells disaster for democracy.◆ The American-style democracy is a rich men’s game based on capital. Money politics penetrates the entire process of election, legislation and administration in the US. People in fact only have a restricted right to political participation. The inequality in economic status has turned into inequality in political status. According to statistics, winners of 91 percent of US congressional elections are the candidates with greater financial support. Big companies, a small group of rich people, and interest groups are more generous to offer financial support and have become the main source of electoral funding. The so-called representatives of people’s will, once elected, often serve the interests of their financial backers, and speak for vested interests rather than the ordinary people. A US Senator had a sharp observation, “Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress.”US Republican congressman from Alabama Mo Brooks publicly denounced “corruption” of the US Congress in a video on social media. “If you want to be chairman of a major committee, you have to purchase it.” The purchase price depends on how important the committee is, with the minimum bid for a major committee being one million US dollars. Those who cannot afford it have to accept the contributions of special interest groups and then give “quid pro quos” to the lobbyists. “Special interest groups run Washington. I don’t mean that metaphorically, I mean that literally.”◆ According to a scholar in Singapore, the United States is clearly not functioning as a democracy. It is functioning as a plutocracy. A democracy is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. A plutocracy is a government of the one percent, by the one percent, for the one percent.◆ The US presidential election follows the Electoral College system, where the president and vice president are elected by the Electoral College. The flaws of such an electoral system are self-evident. First, as the president-elect may not be the winner of the national popular vote, there is a lack of broad representation. Second, as each state gets to decide its own electoral rules, confusion and disorder often occur. Third, the winner-takes-all system exacerbates inequality among states and between political parties. It leads to a huge waste of votes and discourages voter turnout. Voters in deep blue and deep red states are often neglected, while swing states become disproportionately more important where both parties seek to woo more supporters. There have been five presidential elections in US history in which the winner of nationwide popular vote was not elected the president.The gerrymandering is widely recognized by the US public as a flaw of the electoral system. It refers to an unfair division of electoral districts in favor of a particular party to win as many seats as possible and cement its advantage. The US conducts a census every ten years. Following the completion of the census, redistricting or the redrawing of electoral district boundaries will take place under the principle of maintaining roughly equal population in every voting district while considering demographic shifts. Under the US Constitution, each state legislature has the power to redistrict. This leaves room for gerrymandering by the majority party in a state legislature. According to a YouGov poll in 2021, only 16 percent of US adult citizens say they think their states’ congressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44 percent say they think the maps would be drawn unfairly and another 40 percent of adults say they are unsure if the maps will be fair.◆ The American-style democracy is “one person one vote” in name, yet “rule of a dominant minority” in reality. Political pluralism is only a facade. A small number of elites dominate the political, economic and military affairs. They control the state apparatus and policy-making process, manipulate public opinion, dominate the business community and enjoy all kinds of privileges.According to the Associated Press, 18.8 million people were missed in the 2020 US census. The black population had a net undercount of 3.3 percent, while it was almost five percent for Hispanics and 5.6 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans living on reservations. The undercount robs them of their equal share of federal resources including in education, health care and housing and puts them in an unfavorable condition as to congressional apportionment. It reveals the hypocrisy in the US democracy and its “perpetuating systemic racism”.Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that the US is a “really existing capitalist democracy”, where there is a positive correlation between people’s wealth and their influence on policy-making. For the lower 70 percent on the wealth/income scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever. They are effectively disenfranchised.Wertheimer, President of the non-profit US organization Democracy 21, says that corruption in the US is systemic corruption of the process itself. “When you are dealing with billions and billions of dollars, much of that focused on buying influence, it overwhelms the system, and it is much harder to defend against and maintain representation for ordinary Americans.”Danny Haiphong, an independent journalist in the US, believes that Western-style democracy views the election itself as the highest achievement. The question of whether this system serves the needs of the broad masses of people is generally ignored in order to obscure the fact that powerful corporate interests set the policy agenda well before votes are cast.◆ The checks and balances in the American-style democracy have resulted in a “vetocracy”. American political scientist Francis Fukuyama points out in his book Political Order and Political Decay that there is an entrenched political paralysis in the US. The US political system has far too many checks and balances, raising the cost of collective action and in some cases making it impossible altogether. The US democratic process is fragmented and lengthy, with a lot of veto points where individual veto players can block action by the whole body. The function of “checks and balances”, which was purportedly designed to prevent abuse of power, has been distorted in American political practice. Politicians in Washington, D.C. are preoccupied with securing their own partisan interests and no longer care about national development. The two parties are addicted to vetoing and caught in a vicious circle. The government efficacy is inevitably weakened, law and justice trampled upon, development and progress stalled, and social division widened.According to a Pew Research Center report in October 2021 based on a survey of 17 advanced economies including the US, Germany and the ROK, the US is more politically divided than the other economies surveyed. Nine in ten US respondents believe there are strong conflicts between people who support different political parties, and nearly 60 percent of Americans surveyed think their fellow citizens no longer disagree simply over policies, but also over basic facts.As political and partisan polarization continues to grow, more “opposition for opposition’s sake” is seen among Democrats and Republicans. Under its influence, voters of the two parties are increasingly antagonized over gun policy. Among Republican voters, 76 percent support the right to possess guns, while 81 percent of Democratic voters see gun control as more important. Hijacked by interest, partisan conflict and the public opinion, the legislation and law enforcement process of gun control is fraught with difficulties. For the past ten years, Democratic congressmen put forward dozens of bills on gun violence and gun control every year, but due to the continued obstruction from the Republican Party, only a handful of them successfully entered the plenary deliberation and debate stage at the Senate or the House of Representatives.The US National Rifle Association (NRA) has five million members and spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and lobbying every year. Its tentacles penetrate deep into the fabric of the American society. The NRA is an important funder of the Republican Party. Since its establishment in 1871, the NRA has successfully attracted nine US presidents to join it. According to CNN statistics in 2018, 307 of the 535 US congressmen have received either direct campaign contributions from the NRA and its affiliates or benefited from independent NRA spending like advertising supporting their campaigns. In the face of huge profits, all kinds of gun control efforts have ended up in vain.◆ The US is not a straight A student when it comes to democracy. Its practice of democracy has been messy and chaotic. On 6 January 2021, thousands of Americans gathered on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. and stormed the Capitol building in a bid to stop the joint session of the Congress from certifying the newly-elected president. The incident interrupted the transfer of US presidential power, leaving five dead and over 140 injured. It is the worst act of violence in Washington, D.C. since 1814 when the British troops set fire to the White House, and it sent shock waves throughout the international community. The US Senate Republican leader described it as a “failed insurrection”.A scholar from the US Council on Foreign Relations says that the US is not nearly as unique as many Americans believe, and that the Capitol riot should put an end to the notion of American exceptionalism, of an eternal shining city on a hill.An American expert on international issues wrote in The New York Times that while the US leader has reunited the West, he may not be able to reunite America. Trump and his supporters would be willing to depart from established constitutional rules and norms with his Big Lie. This may undermine the ability of the US government to transfer power peacefully and legitimately. Consequently none of the institutions will work for long, and the people will be thrust into political and financial chaos.◆ The dysfunctional American-style democracy has triggered a trust crisis. Public commitments to the people come with behind-the-scene deals. Political infighting, money politics, and vetocracy make it virtually impossible for quality governance to be delivered as aspired by the general public. Americans are increasingly disillusioned with the US politics and pessimistic about the American-style democracy.A Gallup survey in October 2020 shows that only 19 percent of the Americans surveyed are “very confident” about the presidential election, a record low since the survey was first conducted in 2004. According to a poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal in June 2022, six out of 10 Americans feel pessimistic about achieving the American dream.A Pew Research in 2021 shows that 65 percent of Americans see a need for major reform to the American democracy. People’s confidence in the American democracy dropped in 16 developed countries, and 57 percent of respondents think that the American democracy is no longer a good example to follow.The Democracy Perception Index released in 2021 by a German polling agency reveals that 44 percent of respondents in the 53 countries surveyed are concerned that the US threatens democracy in their country.◆ Over the years, despite the structural flaws and problematic practice of its democratic system, the US has been touting the “alliance of democracies” and hyping up the narrative of “democracy versus autocracy”. It is in essence attacking those who hold different views under the banner of democracy, using ideology and values as a tool to suppress others and advance its own geopolitical strategies. This is hegemony in the guise of democracy. A former CIA official openly stated: “We will intervene whenever we decide it’s in our national security interest to intervene. If you don’t like it, lump it.”The US has pushed for the neo-Monroe Doctrine in Latin America under the pretext of promoting democracy, incited color revolutions in Eurasia, and remotely controlled the Arab Spring in West Asia and North Africa. These moves have brought chaos and disasters to many countries, gravely undermining world peace, stability and development. As suggested by the French website Le Grand Soir, democracy has long become a weapon of massive destruction for the US to attack countries with different views.◆ Whether a country is democratic or not depends on whether its people are truly the masters of the country. It depends on whether the people have the right to vote, and more importantly, the right to participate; what promises they are given during elections, and more importantly, how many of these promises are delivered after elections; what kind of political procedures and rules are set through state systems and laws, and more importantly, whether these systems and laws are truly enforced; and whether the rules and procedures for the exercise of power are democratic, and more importantly, whether the exercise of power is genuinely subject to public oversight and checks.◆ The Communist Party of China (CPC) leads the Chinese people in carrying out the whole-process people’s democracy in China. It has not only a complete set of institutions and procedures, but also full-fledged civil participation. A comprehensive, extensive, and well-coordinated system of institutions has been formed to ensure that the people run the country, and diverse, open, and orderly channels for democracy are put into place. This allows the entire people to engage in law-based democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight and to manage state as well as economic, cultural, and social affairs in various ways and forms and in accordance with the law. The whole-process people’s democracy integrates process-oriented democracy with results-oriented democracy, procedural democracy with substantive democracy, direct democracy with indirect democracy, and people’s democracy with the will of the state. It is a model of socialist democracy that covers all aspects of the democratic process and all sectors of society. It is a true democracy that works. China’s whole-process people’s democracy is gaining wider recognition and acclaim from the international community.A British scholar says that electoral democracy does not breed a close relationship with the people and government, because the people are only called upon to be involved whenever to make elections take place. The Chinese approach is different in that there is a very important consultative component in the way China operates.◆ Democracy is a concrete phenomenon that is constantly evolving. Rooted in history, culture and tradition, it takes diverse forms and develops along the paths chosen by different peoples based on their exploration and innovation. China stays committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries. China has no intention to engage in systemic rivalry or ideological confrontation with the US. China never exports ideology, never interferes in other countries’ internal affairs, and never seeks to change the system of the US.Falsehood 5: The US has profound differences with the CPC and the Chinese Government. But those differences are between governments and systems – not between our people.Reality check: The CPC’s leadership is the choice of history and of the people. The CPC and the Chinese government enjoy the wholehearted support and endorsement of the Chinese people. The US’s attempt to drive wedges between the CPC and the Chinese people only serves to reveal its animosity against China’s system and path.◆ The CPC has deep roots among and close ties with the Chinese people. This is what has kept the CPC full of vigor and vitality. By the end of 2021, the CPC had over 95 million members. The CPC is the largest party in the world that has exercised long-term governance in the world’s most populous country. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has created the two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. Over 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty and 1.4 billion people are moving toward modernization. Over the course of just several decades, China has accomplished what took western developed countries hundreds of years.A Harvard University survey among the Chinese people spanning 13 years found that more than 90 percent of respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government, the highest rate among countries for years running. A trust and credibility survey released in 2022 by Edelman, a renowned US public relations consultancy firm, shows that as many as 91 percent Chinese citizens trust their government in 2021, the highest among all surveyed countries.◆ The previous US administration, in a McCarthyism-style campaign, went all out to attack and discredit the CPC. It has attacked Chinese leaders and China’s domestic and foreign policies, sown discord between the CPC and the Chinese people, flagrantly challenged the leadership and governing position of the CPC, incited anti-China and anti-CPC sentiment, and imposed visa restrictions on CPC members and their families.The current administration, since its inauguration, has made no substantive changes to those policies. In June 2021, the US Senate passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, which is more than 2,000 pages long. It regarded China as a strategic competitor and the main challenge to the US, slandered China’s development path and domestic and foreign policies, and malignantly urged actions to counter the “influence and malign activities” of the CPC. It asked for more than 200 billion US dollars of public funding to ensure US advantages in key technology sectors over China, and advocated mobilizing US resources in strategic, diplomatic, economic, and technological realms to engage in comprehensive strategic competition with China. The US Senate also proposed an appropriation of 300 million US dollars for each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2026 to “counter the malign influence” of the CPC and designated the US Department of State and Agency for International Development to train journalists on investigative techniques necessary to ensure public accountability related to the Belt and Road Initiative, including “supporting civil society and independent media”.The US continues to use the CPC background as a pretext for cracking down on normal people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. For some time, Chinese students and visiting scholars going to the US have been harassed and suppressed by the US. Most of them were asked whether they or their parents are CPC members. Some were repatriated on inconceivable grounds, such as being suspected of military connections simply because they had photos in their mobile phones of military training at college. These stop-and-search activities go far beyond what the US claims as “normal law enforcement”.◆ The CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people share an inseparable bond. The US says it respects the Chinese people, then it should respect the development path and political system chosen by the Chinese people and respect the CPC that represents the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. By targeting the CPC and the Chinese government, the US is in effect targeting the Chinese people. Anything done to separate the CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people and pit the Chinese people against the CPC and the Chinese government will surely be met with the unanimous opposition and resolute response of the over 1.4 billion Chinese people.Falsehood 6: The United States raises human rights issues and calls for change – not to stand against China, but to stand up for peace, security, and human dignity.Reality Check: The human rights of the Chinese people are guaranteed like never before, with a notable increase in their sense of fulfillment, happiness and security. In contrast, the US has been engaged in grave human rights violations both at home and abroad, and its shocking track record makes it the biggest human rights abuser in the world.◆ China always puts people’s right to subsistence on top of its agenda, prioritizes the work to enhance their right to development, regards the protection of citizens’ lawful rights and interests as its basic task, has made the safeguarding of the rights of ethnic groups an important part of its work, and considers the protection of people’s safety its long-term goal.Guided by a people-centered philosophy, since the day when it was founded, the CPC has made seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its mission. For the past 100 years, the Party has been working tirelessly for the interest of the people, and has dedicated itself to realizing people’s aspirations for a better life. China has been advancing whole-process people’s democracy, promoting legal safeguard for human rights, and upholding social equity and justice. The Chinese people now enjoy fuller and more extensive and comprehensive democratic rights.◆ China has created the miracle of eliminating absolute poverty. By the end of 2020, China has lifted all 98.99 million rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty. In 2021, China completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and historically resolved the problem of absolute poverty. Since the launch of reform and opening-up, 770 million impoverished rural residents have shaken off poverty as currently defined. Based on the international poverty line of the World Bank, China accounts for 70 percent of global poverty reduction over the same period. China met the poverty reduction goal of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ten years ahead of schedule, making major contributions to global poverty reduction and human rights progress. China has also put in place the world’s largest education system, the largest social security system and the largest health care system.◆ Since COVID-19 started, China has been acting on the principle of putting the people and their lives first. Based on China’s national conditions, it has formulated and implemented a dynamic zero-COVID guideline, and has been constantly fine-tuning its response measures in light of the evolving situation, to best protect people’s life and health and at the same time, ensure sustained, sound and steady socioeconomic development with the pandemic under effective control. Both the infection rate and mortality rate of China are the lowest in the world.◆ As an active participant in global human rights governance, China has made its contribution to and offered its initiatives on world human rights development. In recent years, the concept of “building a community of shared future” has been written into the resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council, and China-sponsored resolutions on “the contribution of development to the enjoyment of all human rights” and on “Promoting Mutually Beneficial Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights” were adopted multiple times at the Human Rights Council. China also made joint statements on behalf of developing countries on the implementation of the right to development, the promotion of human rights by poverty alleviation, equitable distribution of vaccines, among other subjects, contributing its share to safeguarding the basic human rights of developing countries, which has won it wide recognition and support from the international community.◆ China has been an advocate and a doer in advancing the international human rights cause. A World Bank study estimates, if implemented fully, the Belt and Road Initiative could lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty — those who live on less than $3.2 a day. It shows how participating in Belt and Road cooperation can advance human rights in more countries. In the face of the pandemic, China launched its largest global humanitarian operation since the founding of the People’s Republic, and championed the building of a global community of health for all. To address the global development deficit, China proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) which sees improving people’s welfare and achieving well-rounded human development as the fundamental purpose and goal. The GDI has been echoed and supported by more than 100 countries and many international organizations including the UN. The Initiative galvanizes extensive international consensus for accelerated implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and builds up international synergy for coordinated development, thus providing a strong underpinning for the advancement of the international human rights cause.◆ The right to life is of utmost importance, as survival is the basis of all human rights. Endowed with the world’s most advanced medical equipment and technologies, the US has registered the world’s largest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Pandemic response has been extremely politicized, and become a tool and lever to attack, undercut and oppose each other between the Republicans and the Democrats. Politicians only focus on political gains, with no regard to the life and health of the ordinary people. Its pandemic control, which has been unscientific, unequal and irresponsible, has gravely undermined American people’s right to life and health.So far, the COVID-19 death toll in the US has surpassed one million. The deaths are, according to The Atlantic, “unexpected, untimely, particularly painful, and, in many cases, preventable”. Some politician even suggested that old people may sacrifice themselves for the country and that saving the country’s economy is more important than old people’s lives. Data of the US Center for Disease Prevention and Control shows that most COVID victims are aged 65 years and above. USC and Princeton researchers project that due to the pandemic deaths last year, life expectancy at birth for Americans will shorten by 1.13 years, the sharpest decline since World War II. “For Blacks, the life expectancy would shorten by 2.10 years, and for Latinos, by 3.05 years. Whites are also impacted, but their projected decline is much smaller – 0.68 years.”The Washington Post points to a far greater number behind the one million death toll: That number is 9 million – the number of Americans who have lost spouses, parents, grandparents, siblings and children to COVID. A study by the Imperial College London estimates that more than 250,000 US children had lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19 by 23 May 2020. Figures released by the US Government Accountability Office in March 2022 show that up to 23 million people in the US may have developed “long COVID”, and an estimated one million people suffering from the symptoms may be pushed out of work.The US is the country most rampant with gun violence. Its population, totaling 333 million or 4 percent of the world’s total, own more than 400 million guns or 46 percent of all the private guns in the world. It tops the world in terms of gun ownership, and shooting incidents every now and then in the US takes away more than 110 lives on a daily average. Many people say it is easier to buy a gun than baby formula in the US.Data of the US website Gun Violence Archive show about 45,000 Americans are killed in gun violence incidents in 2021. On 24 May 2022, the Robb elementary school shooting in Texas claimed 21 lives, including 19 children. By US media counts, it is the 39th campus shooting this year. According to The Washington Post tally, 202 mass shootings took place in the US in the first five and half months this year. For decades, no substantive measures have been taken by the US government to address such problems. In the past 25 years, the US federal government fails to introduce any gun control act. The New York Times observed, “The United States has become ungovernable not because of political differences or protest or a lack of civility, but because this is a country unwilling to protect and care for its citizens – its women, its racial minorities and especially its children.”Despite the claim by US founding fathers that “All men are created equal”, slavery was preserved in its Constitution of 1789. Although the US has abolished segregation on the surface, white supremacy continues to wreak havoc, and systemic discrimination against racial minorities still exists even to this day. The entrenched racism, compounded by the coronavirus, has fueled a new spike of hate crimes against Asian-Americans. At the same time, racial persecution of the indigenous people persists, discrimination against the Muslim community worsens, racial economic divide yawns, and racial inequality aggravates day by day. Nearly 60 years on since Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” speech, people still see a brutal reality as reflected in George Floyd’s “I can’t breathe” plea.◆ Through slaughter, expulsion, sterilization and forced assimilation, the US committed a genocide against Native Americans, resulting in a sharp drop in their population from five million in 1492 to 250,000 in the early 20th century. The Native American community has long been neglected and discriminated against. The indigenous culture was fundamentally crushed, and the inter-generational inheritance of indigenous lives and spirits was under severe threats. Many US government statistical programs either leave them out completely or simply classify them as “others”.Shannon Keller O’Loughlin, Chief Executive and Attorney of the Association on American Indian Affairs, said that Native Americans have diverse cultures and languages, but are often seen not as an ethnic group, but as a political stratum with limited autonomy based on treaties with the federal government. The Atlantic commented that from the expulsion, slaughter and forced assimilation back in history to the current widespread poverty and neglect, the American Indians, once the owner of this continent, now have a very weak voice in American society.The US government enforced the system of boarding schools in Native American areas to impose English and Christian education on Native American children. It also enacted laws prohibiting Native Americans from performing religious rituals which have been passed down through generations. An article titled “The United States Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides” carried by Foreign Policy website on 11 October 2021 noted that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, there were more than 350 government funded indigenous boarding schools across the US. Hundreds of thousands of indigenous children passed through, or died in, these schools. The purpose of Indian boarding schools was to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly relocating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities where their American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were to be forcibly suppressed. The US was not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people.Native American writer Rebecca Nagle believes that information about Native Americans has been systematically removed from mainstream media and popular culture. According to a report by National Indian Education Association, 87 percent of state-level US history textbooks do not mention the post-1900 history of indigenous people. According to the Smithsonian Institution, things taught about Native Americans in American schools are full of inaccurate information and fail to present the real picture of the sufferings of indigenous people. Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator, said publicly at the Young America’s Foundation that “We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here ... but candidly, there isn’t much Native American culture in American culture.”◆ Islamphobia and the discrimination against and suppression of Muslims and Islam in US mainstream society has become more pronounced. A Bloomberg report on 9 September 2021 observed that discrimination against Muslims in the US increased in the two decades after 9/11. On the same day, the Associated Press cited a survey which found that 53 percent of Americans have negative views toward Islam. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in its 2021 report that it receives an increasing number of complaints each year about bullying and hate speech against Muslims.According to the survey findings released by the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley on 29 October 2021, 67.5 percent of Muslim respondents said they had experienced Islamophobia, and an even larger percent of those surveyed, 93.7 percent, said that anti-Muslim hatred had affected their mental or emotional well-being to some degree.◆ The US has serious problems of human trafficking and forced labor. It still has not ratified the Forced Labour Convention (1930), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Every year, nearly 100,000 people are smuggled into the US for forced labor. Today, there are at least half a million people enslaved in the US; roughly 240,000 to 325,000 women and children are victims of sexual slavery.◆ Immigrants and refugees have become a tool of partisan feuding and political rivalry in the US. The government changes its rules and regulations capriciously, enforces laws violently, and immigrants have been subjected to inhuman treatment such as prolonged detention, torture and forced labor. Data released by US Border Patrol shows that in fiscal year 2021, as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of the US, more than double the previous fiscal year, hitting the highest number since records began in 1998. That same year, the US detained more than 1.7 million immigrants at the southern border, including 45,000 children. In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti crowded under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. US border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging toward the crowds to expel them into the river. CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves.◆ Turning a blind eye to the systematic violation of the human rights of its own people, the US government has wilfully attacked other countries and interfered in their internal affairs in the name of human rights, challenging right with might and trampling on justice out of selfish interest.Since 2001, the US has waged war or conducted military operations in about 80 countries in the name of “war on terror”, resulting in the deaths of more than 900,000 people, including 300,000 civilians. The 20-year-long war waged by the US has left Afghanistan devastated and impoverished. A total of 47,245 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers unrelated to 9/11 have been killed and more than 10 million displaced as a result of US operations. The War in Afghanistan has destroyed the foundation of economic development and impoverished the Afghan people. When the US withdrew from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central bank, pushing the Afghan economy to the brink of collapse and making things worse for the Afghan people.At the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council, many countries denounced the US as “the biggest destroyer of human rights in the world” and urged it to address its own gross human rights problems.◆ The US has been an expert in arbitrary detention and torture. Under the pretext of “war on terror”, the CIA has set up black sites in at least 54 countries and regions over the years, where more than 100,000 people are detained. A group of independent human rights experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council said in a statement released on 10 January 2022 that the US has arbitrarily detained people without trial and subjected them to torture or ill-treatment in Guantanamo Bay for 20 years in violation of international human rights law, calling this “a stain on the US Government’s commitment to the rule of law”. The US should face up to and resolve its own systemic and chronic human rights problems, reflect on the humanitarian disasters and crimes it has caused around the world, and give a responsible account of itself to the international community.Falsehood 7: The US remains committed to its “one China” policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, the Six Assurances. Its policy on Taiwan has not changed. Reality Check: The one-China principle is an established norm of international relations and a universal consensus of the international community. The US has acted faithlessly, kept regressing from its own commitments and the consensus it reached with China, and attempted to weaken and undermine the one-China principle and use Taiwan to contain China. This is a major threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.◆ In October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted, with an overwhelming majority, Resolution 2758, which decided to restore the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the UN, and has solved once and for all the issue of China’s representation in the UN in political, legal and procedural terms. The official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat pointed out explicitly that “the United Nations considers ‘Taiwan’ as a province of China with no separate status”, the “‘authorities’ in ‘Taipei’ are not considered to ... enjoy any form of governmental status”, and “Reference to ‘Taiwan’ ... should read ‘Taiwan, Province of China’”.On the basis of the one-China principle, China has established diplomatic relations with 181 countries, including the US.◆ The US made the following commitments to China regarding the one-China principle in the three China-US joint communiqués.In the Shanghai Communiqué released in 1972, the US explicitly stated that “The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position”.In the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations released in 1978, the US clearly stated that “The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China”; “The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China”.In the August 17 Communiqué released in 1982, the US unequivocally stated that “In the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations on January 1, 1979, issued by the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America, the United States of America recognized the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, and it acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China”, and that “it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China’s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China, one Taiwan’”.According to this Communiqué, “the United States Government states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution. In so stating, the United States acknowledges China’s consistent position regarding the thorough settlement of this issue”.◆ Rather than faithfully abiding by its commitments on Taiwan, the US has kept backpedaling on history.On the political front, the US has added the so-called “Taiwan Relations Act” and the “Six Assurances” to the expression of its one-China policy, with a growing list of such prefixes. Both prefixes are unilaterally made by the US side in breach of its commitments in the three China-US joint communiqués as well as the one-China principle affirmed in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and widely observed by the international community. They are illegal, null and void from the very beginning, and China has never acknowledged and has firmly rejected them from the outset. The US has also violated its commitment of maintaining unofficial relations only with Taiwan and kept upgrading the level of engagement. In recent years, senior US officials including the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Under Secretary of State as well as members of Congress have visited Taiwan. US ambassadors overseas have also met with Taiwan’s so-called “representatives” in their host countries.In the military field, the US has reneged on its commitment “that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution”. Instead of ceasing the arms sales, it has sold weapons at a larger scale and with enhanced capability including assault weaponries such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy weight torpedoes, and F-16V fighter jets. To date, the total volume of US arms sales to Taiwan has exceeded 70 billion US dollars. According to reports by Reuters and other new agencies, US special operations forces have been rotating into Taiwan on a temporary basis to train with Taiwanese forces.Since 2021, the US leader has stated publicly on three occasions that the US would help defend Taiwan in case of a war in the Taiwan Strait.On the international stage, the US has been assisting Taiwan in expanding its so-called “international space”. Recently, the US has been spreading globally the fallacy that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not determine the status of Taiwan, and that each country should be able to determine the contours of its own “one China” policy. It has vigorously advocated support for Taiwan’s participation as an observer in the 75th session of the World Health Assembly, and even blatantly helped to consolidate Taiwan’s “diplomatic relations”.◆ These US acts have breached its commitment that “it has no intention of ... pursuing a policy of ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China, one Taiwan’”. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2022, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said, “my understanding of the agreement (China and the US reached upon the establishment of diplomatic relations) has been that the United States would uphold the principle of one China ... it is essential that these principles be maintained, and the United States should not by subterfuge or a gradual process, develop something of a two-China solution”.◆ The DPP authorities have been stubbornly advancing its “Taiwan independence” separatist agenda, and the US has been encouraging and supporting “Taiwan independence” forces overtly and covertly. This is the root cause of current tensions across the Taiwan Strait. To defend peace across the Taiwan Strait and beyond, we must forestall the growing tendency of “Taiwan independence” and the collusion between the US and Taiwan. The one-China principle must not be challenged. China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be infringed upon. And the red line that no one should pursue a policy of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” must not be crossed. China is fully confident, capable and prepared to resolutely curb “Taiwan independence” separatist activities, resolutely foil all external interferences, and firmly safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US should abide by the provisions in the three China-US joint communiqués, follow a true one-China policy, and act on its commitments including on not supporting “Taiwan independence”. The US needs to genuinely reflect on and redress its regressive and erroneous behavior, and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan question. Otherwise, it would gravely jeopardize peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, undermine China-US relations and incur an unbearable cost on itself.Falsehood 8: The United States stands with countries and people around the world against the genocide and crimes against humanity happening in the Xinjiang region, where more than a million people have been placed in detention camps because of their ethnic and religious identity.Reality Check: The human rights of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully protected. There is no “genocide” or “crimes against humanity” in Xinjiang. The US has been spreading disinformation about Xinjiang simply to create an excuse for discrediting and attacking China.◆ Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, but about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism. According to figures available, between 1990 and the end of 2016, there were several thousand incidents of violent and terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, killing large numbers of innocent people and hundreds of police officers, and causing immeasurable property damage.In response to such real threats, Xinjiang has acted resolutely to fight terrorism and extremism in accordance with law. At the same time, a series of supporting measures have been taken, like improving people’s livelihoods, raising public awareness about law, and offering help through vocational education and training centers. The trend of frequent terrorist activities has thus been effectively curbed. There has been no violent act of terrorism in Xinjiang for five consecutive years and more. The region has enjoyed security, social stability and good development. The safety and security of people of all ethnic groups have been effectively protected.◆ “Genocide” in Xinjiang is a complete “lie of the century”. Over the past 60 years and more, the Uyghur population has increased from 2.2 million to about 12 million, and their average life expectancy has grown from 30 to 75 years.With stability prevailing in Xinjiang, local people live and work in peace and happiness. The region has made unprecedented progress in delivering economic and social development and in bettering people’s lives. Between 2014 and 2019, GDP in Xinjiang rose from 919.59 billion yuan to 1.36 trillion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent, while per capita disposable income grew by an average annual rate of 9.1 percent. Remarkable achievements have been made in eliminating extreme poverty. All 3.09 million impoverished people by current standards have been lifted out of poverty, making absolute poverty a thing of the past in Xinjiang.The lawful rights and interests of the people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang have been protected effectively. All ethnic groups, regardless of their populations, have equal legal status and enjoy freedom of religious belief and various rights in accordance with law, including participating in the management of state affairs, receiving education, using their own languages, and preserving their traditional culture.◆ In July 2019, permanent representatives of more than 50 countries in Geneva sent a joint letter to the President of the UN Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, praising China’s achievements in fighting terrorism, deradicalization and human rights protection. In October 2019, more than 60 countries spoke at the Third Committee of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, commending the tremendous human rights advancement in Xinjiang. In June 2021, more than 90 countries made joint or separate statements at the Human Rights Council in support of China. In the meantime, Canada took the lead in attacking China on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. Just a little over 40 countries echoed Canada’s criticism, and none of them are from the Muslim world.◆ In recent years, over 2,000 people from more than 100 countries, including experts, scholars, journalists, diplomats and religious figures, have visited Xinjiang, witnessing the unity, harmony and happiness of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.◆ The so-called “genocide” in Xinjiang is a lie cooked up by anti-China forces represented by the anti-China German scholar Adrian Zenz. He is a member of the far-right group “Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation” sponsored by the US government, and a key figure in an anti-China organization set up by US intelligence agencies. He is also a racist. His “research” is full of inconsistencies, fabrications and data manipulation. It does not have any academic credibility and cannot be cleared for academic publication. For example, a chart in Zenz’s “paper” claims that new IUD placements in Xinjiang average between 800 and 1,400 per person each year, which means each woman in the region would have to undergo four to eight such insertion surgeries every day. This is totally against common sense.◆ On 29 June 2020, the Jamestown Foundation of the US published a “research report” by Adrian Zenz, in which he falsely accused the Chinese government of committing “genocide” against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.Upon the release of the report, US politicians including then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, Senator Marco Rubio and House Representative Jim McGovern immediately pitched in to whip up the “genocide” accusation. Rubio, McGovern, Senator John Cornyn and Senator Robert Menendez went on to urge the administration to make a genocide determination of China’s policy on Xinjiang. Contradicting the conclusion reached by lawyers at the State Department Office of the Legal Adviser, Pompeo announced that “I have determined that the People’s Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, China, targeting Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups” on 19 January 2021, the last day of the previous administration. The current administration has followed the same position and continued to allege “genocide” in Xinjiang. This further exposes the US’s real intention of political manipulation in the name of human rights.◆ The World Uyghur Congress, an anti-China separatist organization, hired people like Sayragul Sauytbay and Tursunay Ziawudun to make false statements and spread all kinds of lies about “persecution”. In the 70-plus press conferences held so far by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, falsehoods spread by anti-China forces have been debunked with solid facts. For instance, some “performers” who claimed to be the victims of forced sterilization in vocational education and training centers have never been to one. The family members or friends reported by some “performers” as missing are actually living a normal life in Xinjiang.◆ The false claim about “millions of Uyghurs detained” in education and training centers was initiated and spread by “Chinese Human Rights Defenders”, an NGO supported by the US government. Based on interviews with eight Uyghurs and rough estimation, the organization came to the preposterous conclusion that at least 10 percent of the 20 million people in Xinjiang are detained in “reeducation camps”.The education and training centers in Xinjiang are no different in nature from deradicalization centers or community correction and desistance and disengagement programs in many other countries. It has been proven to be a successful exploration in preventative counter-terrorism and deradicalization, consistent with the principle and spirit of counter-terrorism resolutions including the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. At the centers, trainees acquire greater proficiency in standard spoken and written Chinese language and employability, and gain a stronger sense of national identity, citizenship and rule of law. By October 2019, all trainees had graduated from the centers. Most of them have steady employment after finding jobs by themselves or with the help of the government, or starting up their own businesses.◆ The US and some other Western countries have been making an issue of human rights in Xinjiang in total disregard of the basic reality of human rights protection and development there. It has become a means for them to achieve their strategic objective of using Xinjiang as a pretext to contain China. Lawrence Wilkerson, a retired US Army Colonel and chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, said publicly in August 2018 that one of the three-fold purpose of the US military’s presence in Afghanistan is the containment of China — “If the CIA would want to destabilize China, that would be the best way to do it – to form an unrest, and join with those Uyghurs in pushing ... Beijing from internal places rather than external”.Falsehood 9: The CPC has imposed harsh anti-democratic measures in Hong Kong under the guise of national security. Beijing’s quashing of freedom in Hong Kong violates its handover commitments, enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Reality Check: By attacking and smearing the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), what the US is really up to is to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and make Hong Kong a “bridgehead” for infiltration and interference against the mainland. Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong. Hong Kong affairs are purely China’s internal affairs that brook no interference from the US.◆ For a long time, the US has colluded with the anti-China, destabilizing forces in Hong Kong, interfered in Hong Kong’s political agenda, stoked up social tensions, and even directly intervened in Hong Kong affairs. The US Consul-General in Hong Kong publicly criticized the Hong Kong SAR government for the proposed legislative amendments in 2019 and the One Country, Two Systems. Officials from the US Consulate-General in Hong Kong also met with the so-called leaders of the rioters. The rioters openly admitted that they had discussed with the US the legislative process of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and urged the US to stop exporting tear gas and rubber bullets to the Hong Kong police.◆ Funded and incited by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and other US government’s “white gloves”, anti-China rioters in Hong Kong committed vandalizing, looting and arson in the name of the so-called fight for “democracy” and “freedom”, and violently stormed the building of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of Hong Kong. NED even appeared publicly on the street to direct relevant activities, attempting to stage a “color revolution” in Hong Kong. NED contacted opposition parties, groups and organizations in Hong Kong through its affiliating National Democratic Institute for International Affairs or the National Democratic Institute (NDI). NDI funded the “1 July marches” orchestrated by the opposition to obstruct legislation on Article 23, funded the participation of opposition parties and groups at workshops and seminars, and provided personal counseling on campaigning skills for their leaders, ran a so-called “young political leaders program” to support emerging political groups in confronting the government, plotted, together with opposition members of LegCo, a “five-district referendum”, and directed and funded the opposition and young radicals in orchestrating the illegal “Occupy Central” movement.According to the NED website, two million US dollars were spent on 11 Hong Kong-related projects in 2020, with a particular focus on disrupting LegCo elections. Key projects include: “Strengthening Citizen Election Observation”, which offered technical and financial assistance to newly formed destabilizing groups in Hong Kong, and encouraged them to obstruct LegCo elections by means of election monitoring, get-out-the-vote methods, etc.; “Amplifying Citizens’ Perspectives on Political Participation”, which collected and disseminated survey findings on democratic development, and induced young Hong Kongers to share their political participation experiences on the Internet; “Supporting Unity Among Student Activists”, which called for better coordination among Hong Kong student groups prior to LegCo elections, and instructed and trained them to build capacity for “democratic change” and international communication and to play a role in disrupting electoral order; and “Building Regional Solidarity and Empowering the Hong Kong Movement”, which sought to strengthen Hong Kong’s “democratic movement” through network building, cultivate next-generation “leading activists” in Hong Kong, and set up a network of “democratic movement” in Asia.◆ US officials used “violence” and “shame” to describe the storming of the Capitol building by protesters, but labeled the violent, criminal activities in Hong Kong that assaulted residents and damaged public facilities as “a beautiful sight to behold”. The US police used armored vehicles to disperse demonstrators, abused their force to beat and drive away sit-in demonstrators, and arrested demonstrators after deliberately inducing them to walk on vehicle lanes which constitutes violation of the law, while discrediting the Hong Kong SAR government’s law-based actions to protect people’s rights and the public order as “violation” of human rights. This is another display of US-style hypocritical double standards and exposes its intention to undermine prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and contain China under the pretext of human rights and democracy.◆ During the 150-plus years of British colonial rule, there was no democracy in Hong Kong whatsoever. None of the governors was democratically elected by Hong Kong residents. For most of the time, Legco members were directly appointed by the governor. In stark contrast, after the return of Hong Kong, pursuant to the Basic Law, Hong Kong has come to enjoy the executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. Its residents are masters of the SAR as provided by law who manage their own affairs within the scope of the high degree of autonomy. They enjoy a wide range of democratic rights and freedoms like never before. This is a fact that every fair-minded person would recognize.◆ The purpose of enacting the National Security Law in Hong Kong is to close the legal loopholes in safeguarding national security in the SAR. It is a legitimate and necessary move to respond to violent terrorist activities and illegal external interference in Hong Kong. Constitutions of more than 100 countries have stipulations that the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms shall not endanger national security. According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the rights to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and public trial may be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety and order. The European Convention on Human Rights has similar provisions.The national security law specifically targets four categories of crimes: secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security. It seeks to punish a tiny number of criminals who seriously endanger national security and protect the vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong citizens. It provides better protection for the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents and the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong enshrined in law. It creates the conditions needed for addressing the deep-seated problems in the economy and concerning people’s livelihood. It also helps maintain the rule of law and business environment in Hong Kong, ease the concerns of the business community about social disorder, and offer better conditions for people from around the world who want to work, invest and live in Hong Kong.Over the past two years or so since the National Security Law was enacted, the rule of law in Hong Kong has been strengthened and better guaranteed. Hong Kong’s rule of law index continues to stay among the top in the world. Foreign investors have stronger confidence in the city. Hong Kong is seeing a bright prospect transitioning from chaos to order and to prosperity. According to the 2022 AmCham Hong Kong Business Sentiment Survey released early this year, the number of businesses in Hong Kong optimistic about Hong Kong’s business outlook increased by 18 percent from the previous year, while the number of businesses that are pessimistic was down by 17 percent.◆ The legal basis for the Chinese government to govern Hong Kong is the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The Sino-British Joint Declaration is not relevant in this regard. As China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, all provisions concerning the UK under the Joint Declaration had been fulfilled. The basic policies regarding Hong Kong stated by China in the Joint Declaration are China’s declaration of its policies, which have since been fully embodied in the Basic Law enacted by the National People’s Congress. These policies have not changed; they will continue to be upheld by China. The Joint Declaration does not assign the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong nor give it any right to intervene in Hong Kong affairs after the return of Hong Kong. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or “right of supervision” over Hong Kong after its return. The Joint Declaration is a bilateral instrument between China and the UK; it does not involve any other country or has anything to do with a third country. Sovereign equality and non-interference are enshrined in international law and are basic norms of international relations. Other countries and organizations have no right to meddle in Hong Kong affairs on the grounds of the Joint Declaration.The Central Government of China has unswervingly implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems. Since Hong Kong’s return, the policy of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy has been earnestly implemented with widely recognized achievements. Practice has fully proven that One Country, Two Systems is the best institutional arrangement for Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability. The Central Government will continue to ensure that the policy of One Country, Two Systems remains unchanged, is unwaveringly upheld, and in practice is not bent or distorted.◆ Turning a blind eye to the fact that Hong Kong’s democracy has improved in ways unseen before its return, the US has acted against Hong Kong’s mainstream public opinion for unity and progress and made irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, human rights and freedom as the “preacher” of democracy. This only exposes its hypocritical double standards and the agenda to destabilize Hong Kong and contain China.Falsehood 10: China purports to champion sovereignty and territorial integrity while standing with and defending the Russian government that brazenly violate them.Reality Check: On the Ukraine issue, China has always adhered to an objective and just position, a position shared by most countries. The Cold War mentality and power politics is the root cause of the Ukraine crisis. The US should earnestly shoulder its due responsibilities and take concrete actions to ease the situation and solve the problems.◆ The US has betrayed its own promises and kept pushing for the eastward expansion of NATO，creating the Ukraine crisis.When meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, the then US Secretary of State James Baker gave clear assurances that “there would be no extension of NATO’s jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east”. However, the US has led five rounds of NATO eastward expansion since 1999, increasing its membership from 16 to 30, and advancing NATO more than 1,000 kilometers eastward to the Russian border, forming a C-shaped encirclement of the Black Sea.In 1997, former US diplomat and observer on the Soviet Union George Kennan wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed that “expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.”In 2014, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in the Washington Post that if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it should not join NATO, and that it must not be either side’s outpost against the other — it should function as a bridge between them.At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2022 in Davos, Kissinger said that Ukraine should have been a bridge between Europe and Russia, but that opportunity does not now exist in the same manner. Russia has been for 400 years an essential part of Europe, and on a number of occasions as the guarantor by which the European balance could be re-established. Current policy should keep in mind the restoration of this role is important to develop.An American expert on international affairs points out in an article that the US government should bear considerable responsibility for the deterioration of relations with Russia caused by its major mistake of greenlighting the NATO expansion. Noting that “America and NATO aren’t innocent bystanders”, he also believed that it is “the height of folly” for some US officials to brag in public about leaks or even intelligence sharing between the US and Ukraine. He warned that such instigation on the US side could dangerously widen the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.According to Clare Daly, Member of the European Parliament, the US has been adding fuel to the fire on Ukraine because they want to weaken Russia and benefit from the crisis, for which Europe will pay a heavy price. These is still no hope of peace in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, mainly because the US does not want Russia and Ukraine to reach a peace agreement.Former US Senator Bill Bradley said that “the fundamental blunder that the United States made in the late 80s, early 90s was the expansion of NATO”.Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview if Joe Biden simply promised not to include Ukraine into NATO, the war would have been prevented.Over the years, the US has pursued interventionism and grossly violated the sovereignty of Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, Syria and other countries. Alfred de Zayas, a senior UN expert, said in an exclusive interview that from the perspective of international law, Russia’s military actions in Ukraine violated the UN Charter, but the United States and NATO have broken international law so often over the years that “precedents of permissibility” have therefore been set for Russia’s current actions in terms of customary international law.◆ The US has been fanning the flames on the Ukraine issue. Instead of promoting peace talks, the US continued to provide weapons to Ukraine, escalating tensions and expanding the conflict, making it more prolonged and complicated. This has sufficiently exposed the selfish nature of the US.On 25 April 2022, US Defense Secretary Austin said after a visit to Ukraine that the US wants to use the war to “see Russia weakened”.In late May 2022, on top of the original 13.6 billion dollars aid, the US Congress voted to approve another over 40 billion dollars in military and economic aid to Ukraine. The total assistance has exceeded 70 percent of the combined military expenditure of Russia and Ukraine in 2021.The ongoing crisis has cost Europe heavily in political, economic and social aspects, but the US is reaping dividends, with its arms dealers, food and energy companies gaining huge profits. For example, the market value of US military industrial giants has surged by hundreds of billions, and the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exported to Europe is more than 10 times higher than a year ago.As the result of the conflict, more than 6.5 million Ukrainians have fled into neighboring European countries, posing an unprecedented refugee crisis. But the US admitted only 12 refugees from Ukraine in March 2022. Thousands of Ukrainian refugees remain stranded on the US-Mexico border, and many were in US custody. Even when the UN and the international community are calling for an early end to the conflict, some in the US are still claiming that they would “fight to the last Ukrainian”.◆ The relationship between China and Russia features non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting at any third party. It is essentially different from the practice of the US and a small number of other Western countries, where they still stick to the Cold War mentality and a friend-or-foe dichotomy to draw ideological lines, form so-called “alliances” and “cliques”, pursue bloc politics and create confrontation and division.In the joint statement issued on 4 February 2022, China and Russia call on all to champion humanity’s common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, respect the rights of all peoples to independently determine the development paths of their countries, and the sovereignty, security and development interests of all countries, protect the UN-centered international system, and the international order based on international law, seek true multilateralism with the UN and its Security Council playing a central and coordinating role, promote more democratic international relations, and ensure peace, stability and sustainable development across the world.◆ As a responsible major country, China’s decisions and judgments on the Ukraine issue are made independently based on the merits of the matter. China has made great efforts to safeguard international peace and security, and has been committed to promoting talks for peace and deescalating tensions. China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, that legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and that all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported. China’s position is objective, fair and consistent with the aspirations of most countries.◆ Of the 233 sovereign countries and regions in the world, 185 are not involved in sanctions on Russia. Among the more than 190 members of the UN, more than 140 countries, including NATO member state Turkey, have refused to impose sanctions on Russia. The combined population of countries and regions participating in sanctions against Russia and those who not is 1.1 billion versus 6.5 billion. Among them, those openly oppose sanctions have a combined population of 4.8 billion.About two-thirds of the world’s population does not support Western positions on Ukraine, according to a report by the British Economist magazine.Falsehood 11: The US is setting up new coalitions in the Indo-Pacific for regional peace and stability, and has launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), as it “shares the vision that the regional countries and people across the region hold: one of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”Reality Check: The so-called US vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” is essentially a strategy to divide others, incite confrontation and undermine peace. It runs counter to the trend of the times in the Asia-Pacific, i.e., the trend of peaceful development and win-win cooperation.◆ The US administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy is self-contradictory: the US claims to promote the region’s “freedom and openness” as its goal, while in reality co-opting with allies to forge a “five-four-three-two-one” formation made up of the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, bilateral alliances and IPEF, forming exclusive “small circles” and forcing countries in the region to take sides.AUKUS helps Australia build nuclear-powered submarines and develops hypersonic weapons, pushing up the risk for a regional arms race. Under the pretext of fighting illegal fishing and keeping supply chains resilient, the Quad has vigorously pursued military cooperation and intelligence sharing. The US has also encouraged NATO’s involvement in the Asia-Pacific. These are all attempts to materialize an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO” and promote “integrated deterrence” against China.◆ The Indo-Pacific strategy has raised increasing alarm and concern of many countries, especially those in the Asia-Pacific. As BBC reported, in April 2021, New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta expressed New Zealand’s discomfort with expanding the Five Eyes’ remit by putting pressure on China in this way, and New Zealand still prefers to pursue bilateral relations with China. At the US-ASEAN Special Summit, ASEAN countries stressed their aspiration for peace and cooperation, not for taking sides, division or confrontation.◆ The US has made clear that IPEF is to enable it to win the contest in the 21st century. This means that the IPEF is designed to serve the US economy. The US has shelved the development of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) for a long time, left the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and refused to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This exposes the self-serving nature of the US and its selective approach to international institutions. It is all about the US’ self-interests, nothing mutually beneficial.IPEF is a political instrument of the US in propping up its hegemony in the regional economy. The essence is to dominate the supply chains, value chains and new economic sectors, and marginalize specific countries. The US has chosen to weaponize economic issues as political and ideological ones, using economy to coerce regional countries into taking sides between China and the US.US Trade Representative Katherine Tai publicly stated that IPEF is a standalone arrangement independent from China. US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said IPEF marks the US’s restoration of economic leadership in the region and presents Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China’s approach. Previously, she also expressed that IPEF may harmonize export controls and other “poison pills”, such as limiting sensitive products export to China.IPEF seeks to establish US-led trade rules, restructure the industrial chain system and economically and scientifically “decouple” regional countries from China. Many countries in the region get concerned, and believe that the cost of such “decoupling” will be huge. Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad noted that any trade alliance that excludes the world’s second largest economy is not conducive to closer, multilateral trade cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The US’s exclusion of China is not an economic issue but a political one.◆ Hailed as “menu approach” cooperation, IPEF actually pays little regard to the development level and real needs of the regional countries. It barely gives concessions to developing countries on tariff reduction and market access, but forces participating countries to accept the so-called high standards of the US and its unilateral agenda. IPEF focuses solely on the US’s self-interests and cares little about the needs of other parties. There is no such thing as mutual benefit in IPEF.The Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) pointed out in its report “Regional Perspectives on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” that IPEF has little more to offer than enlarging the US economic presence in the region. It fails to address the issues of the greater interests of regional countries. There is widespread concern that IPEF will only benefit the US, while saddling participating regional countries with a heavy burden.Falsehood 12: China has announced its ambition to create a sphere of influence in the Pacific region. It is advancing unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea, undermining peace and security, freedom of navigation and commerce. The US will continue to oppose Beijing’s aggressive and unlawful activities in the South and East China Seas. It will support the region’s coastal states in upholding their maritime rights, work with allies and partners to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, and will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows.Reality Check: China is committed to the path of peaceful development, the five principles of peaceful coexistence and opposes the practice of the big and strong bullying the small and weak. The US, by painting China as a threat and using “freedom of navigation” as a pretext to undermine China’s sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests, is actually the real threat to regional peace and security.◆ China stands for equality among all countries irrespective of their size, respects every country’s choice of development path suited to its national condition, and does not seek any sphere of influence. China pursues a defense policy that is defensive in nature and a military strategy of active defense. In developing its defense capabilities, China aims to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, and does not target any other country. The growth of China’s defense capabilities amplifies the force for peace in the world.◆ China is the first to have discovered, named, and explored and exploited Nanhai Zhudao and relevant waters, and the first to have exercised sovereignty and jurisdiction over them continuously, peacefully and effectively. China’s sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao and its relevant rights and interests in the South China Sea have been established in the long course of history. They are solidly grounded in history and law, and have been upheld by successive Chinese governments and recognized by the international community. Pursuant to the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, China recovered territories illegally occupied by Japan including Xisha Qundao and Nansha Qundao after WWII, and has since affirmed sovereignty and strengthened jurisdiction by establishing official names, publishing maps, creating administrative units and stationing troops. China’s resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao is a legitimate and lawful act to inherit China’s rights established over the course of history. It is also part of the post-WWII international order, and has been recognized by countries around the world including the US.◆ With the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the overall situation in the South China Sea remains stable. With the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), the parties have increased dialogue, properly handled differences, deepened cooperation and enhanced mutual trust, and have made active progress in advancing consultations on the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, in an effort to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and inject positive dynamics into regional and global security, stability and prosperity. Despite COVID-19, the parties have held offline Senior Officials’ Meetings on the implementation of the DOC and 10 joint working group meetings via video link to advance consultations on the COC text. Last month, the first face-to-face COC consultations since COVID-19 was held in Cambodia. Such positive progress speaks volumes about the resolve and commitment of regional countries to steadfastly advance consultations toward a COC.◆ China respects and supports all countries’ freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea in accordance with international law, and actively safeguards the security of and unimpeded passage through international shipping lanes. In fact, the South China Sea is one of the world’s safest and freest sea lanes. Fifty percent of merchant vessels in the world and one-third of international maritime trade pass through it, and more than 100,000 merchant ships sail through it annually. Freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea has never been an issue.◆ Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China’s inherent territory. China’s patrol and law enforcement missions in waters off the Diaoyu Dao are legitimate measures taken by China to exercise its sovereignty in accordance with law and are necessary responses to Japanese provocations in violation of China’s sovereignty. No country or force should misjudge the strong resolve of the Chinese government to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the same time, China stays committed to properly handling and resolving issues through dialogue and consultation, and has made great efforts to maintain maritime stability. In 2014, a four-point principled consensus was reached between China and Japan to handle and improve China-Japan relations, which includes a clear understanding on managing the situation surrounding Diaoyu Dao and the East China Sea.◆ Acting under the logic of the Monroe Doctrine, the US often uses power politics and hegemonic and bullying acts to flagrantly undermine the international maritime order, with a view to sustaining its maritime predominance. In the 240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years when the country was not at war with others. The US operates over 800 military bases in 80 countries and regions. Its military expenditure, which has topped the world for many years in a row, accounts for one-fourth of the global total and is equivalent to the combined military spending of the next nine countries. Recently, the US has proposed a national defense budget request of about 813 billion US dollars for fiscal year 2023. Such massive military spending makes the US the real “pacing challenge” to the world.◆ The US disregards the history and facts surrounding the South China Sea issue, deliberately stokes disputes on territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and sows discord among regional countries. It has become the biggest force undermining stability and fueling militarization in the South China Sea. Data from relevant organizations show that the number of US close-in reconnaissance activities targeting China has more than doubled over the past decade and more. Right now, an average of five US naval vessels cruise near China’s shore every day. This year, US naval vessels have been sailing through the Taiwan Strait about once a month, and large US reconnaissance planes have flown over 800 times close to China and repeatedly violated China’s airspace. Eager to stir up trouble in the South China Sea, the US has also encouraged its allies and partners to sail their naval vessels into the South China Sea.On 2 October 2021, USS Connecticut, a nuclear submarine, had an underwater collision in the South China Sea. It was not until a week later that the US issued a vague statement, claiming that the submarine hit an unknown object. One month after, it said that the submarine “grounded on an uncharted seamount”. A final report on the accident was eventually released by the US Navy on 23 May 2022, yet no clear explanation has been offered in response to the grave concerns and questions raised by many, including the intent of the submarine, the specific location of the accident, whether the submarine had entered exclusive economic zones (EEZ) and even territorial sea of other countries, and whether the accident had caused a nuclear leak or damaged marine environment.◆ The US began its Freedom of Navigation (FON) Program in 1979 ahead of the signing of the UNCLOS. Challenging the new maritime order, the move sought to maximize the freedom of the US military to rampage through the oceans. The FON Program is not consistent with the universally recognized international law, disregards the sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests of the many littoral countries, and seriously jeopardizes regional peace and stability. Its goal is to advance American maritime supremacy under the pretext of “freedom of navigation”. The FON Program has been firmly opposed by many members of the international community, especially the developing countries.Falsehood 13: Chinese government officials spread disinformation.Reality Check: China is the top victim of disinformation, while the US is the biggest source of spreading disinformation.◆ With sharp confrontation between the Republicans and Democrats, habitual lying, finger-pointing and blame-shifting among politicians have become part of the US political ecology. A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Pearson Institute at the University of Chicago reveals that nearly half of the respondents blame the US government for the spread of misinformation.◆ The US has used disinformation to launch multiple wars across the globe in pursuit of its hegemonic agenda. Colin Powell, the then US Secretary of State accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction with a test tube of “laundry powder”. The US blamed the Syrian government for using bio-chemical weapons against its own people with fake videos by the White Helmets.In 2019, the then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly claimed that “we lied, we cheated, we stole … we had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment.”On 4 May 2022, Republican Senator Rand Paul spoke bluntly at a Senate hearing, “Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The US government.”◆ Manipulation by US politicians has seriously undercut the media’s credibility. A Gallup poll in 2020 shows that 60 percent of Americans remain largely distrustful of the media, among whom 33 percent have no trust at all, which is 5 percentage points higher than that of 2019.◆ The US has on multiple occasions fabricated numerous lies and rumors on issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, democracy and human rights, including the so-called “lab-leak theory”, “genocide” and “forced labor”, which have all been defeated by facts.Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the US has kept spreading disinformation on China and made unfounded accusations against it, in order to shirk its responsibilities for triggering the conflict with NATO’s eastward expansion. The New York Times quoted from anonymous US senior officials who claimed that China had prior knowledge of Russian military operation in Ukraine. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Representative to the UN, said at a Security Council meeting that China had been spreading disinformation in support of Russia. This is sheer fabrication and slandering. Meanwhile, as part of the fierce hunt of voices different from its own, the US has added special labels to Tweets sharing links of Chinese media reports, while turning a blind eye to the Western media that are actually telling the lies.◆ The US has used disinformation as a political tool to attack and suppress China, and formed a supply chain of anti-China rhetoric combining dirty funding, fact-twisting stories and massive smear campaigns. On the surface, these anti-China rhetoric come from certain media outlets and politicians, but what lies underneath is a massive capital-driven supply chain — some institutions and organizations from the US and other Western countries provide dirty funding for political purposes to anti-China groups and individuals; some think-tanks and academic institutions make up fact-twisting stories to fuel anti-China rhetoric around the world through Western hegemony on public opinion; and politicians and media act as mouthpieces propagating lies and falsehoods about China in massive smear campaigns.Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), both fabricated numerous Xinjiang-related lies, are typical examples of such “lies manufacturers”.Adrian Zenz is a member of a far-right group founded by the US government and a key member of an anti-China research institute set up and manipulated by the US intelligence agency. His so-called reports on Xinjiang reflect no credibility, intellectual merit or academic integrity at all.As disclosed by the media, the US State Department and arms manufacturers are the primary foreign sponsors for the ASPI. Funding from the US State Department alone reached nearly 1.4 million Australian dollars a year, all directed to research projects attacking China. The ASPI disseminated a series of lies and disinformation on issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang and data security.◆ In addition to constantly spreading disinformation on China, the US has also rolled out measures to suppress and contain China based on such disinformation, including China-related bills and sanctions. In December 2021, under the pretext of its so-called concerns on “forced labor”, the US signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law, imposing a full ban on imports from Xinjiang. This is a malicious move to denigrate human rights situation in Xinjiang, and a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.◆ China has used facts and figures to tell the truth and refute the lies and rumors created and propagated by the US. It is aimed at making truth heard, not spreading disinformation. Instead of observing basic facts, the US has acted in its own interests and labeled all views different from its own as “disinformation”. This is, in essence, hegemony and bullying in the field of public opinion.Falsehood 14: China is circumventing or breaking trade rules and its economic manipulations have cost American workers millions of jobs, harming workers and companies in the United States but also around the world. The United States will push back on market-distorting policies and practices, like subsidies and market access barriers, which China’s government has used for years to gain competitive advantage.Reality Check: China has faithfully delivered on its commitments made upon accession to the WTO. China upholds, builds and contributes to the multilateral trading system. China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial in nature. However, US’ wanton suppression of China in trade and investment areas has been the root cause of trade frictions between the two countries, which hurts others without benefiting oneself.◆ Over the past 20-plus years since joining the WTO, China has earnestly fulfilled its commitments upon accession. It has rolled out nationwide the management system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list, kept expanding market access, brought down overall tariff level from 15.3% to 7.4%, and opened up nearly 120 sectors in the service industry.In October 2021, the WTO conducted the eighth review of trade policies and practices of China. The report of the review fully recognized China’s efforts in upholding the multilateral trading system and its active role in the WTO. It spoke highly of China’s achievements in such areas as trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, greater opening-up and progress under the Belt and Road Initiative.A leading official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development pointed out that, over the past two decades, China has steadfastly supported the rules-based multilateral trading system, practiced true multilateralism, participated fully in WTO negotiations, steered negotiations in areas such as investment facilitation and e-commerce, and worked for WTO rules keeping pace with the times.◆ Embracing the trend of regional and global economic integration, China has deepened economic and trade ties with countries around the world, signing free trade agreements and stepping up the building of free trade zones. As of now, China has signed 19 free trade agreements with 26 countries and regions.◆ China has actively deepened supply-side structural reform. It has met the target of phasing out 150 million tons of overcapacity in the steel industry set out in the 13th Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, 1.14 times of the global total in slashing overcapacity of steels. The process involved the reemployment of 280,000 Chinese steel workers, more than the total number of steel workers in the US, Europe and Japan.◆ China and the US have highly complementary economies, deeply integrated interests, and mutually beneficial economic and trade ties. In 2021, bilateral trade topped record-breaking 750 billion US dollars. The US Export Report 2022 issued by the US-China Business Council showed that, in 2021, goods exports to China grew by 21 percent to 149 billion US dollars, supporting 858,000 jobs in the US. The 2020 Annual Business Survey Report on Chinese Enterprises in the United States released by the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA indicated that, as of 2019, CGCC’s Chinese member companies cumulatively invested over 123 billion US dollars, employed more than 220,000 people, and supported over one million jobs throughout the United States. Research of the US-China Business Council showed that Chinese exports have helped bring down US consumer price by 1 to 1.5 percent, saving each US household 850 US dollars per year.◆ By blaming China for its own economic problems, the US started a trade war and tariff war against China, which only backfired for itself. US tariffs against China have cost American companies more than 1.7 trillion US dollars in market capitalization and increased average household expenditure by 1,300 US dollars per year. A 2021 report by the US-China Business Council pointed out that the trade war with China has resulted in a loss of 245,000 jobs in the US. A report from Moody’s Investor Service was cited as saying that American consumers bear 92.4 percent of the cost of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize laureate in economics, incisively pointed out that US trade policy toward China has failed and tariffs harm the US more than their intended targets.On 18 May 2022, the National Retail Federation (NRF) wrote to President Biden, calling for eliminating tariffs, which, as pointed out in the letter, could reduce consumer prices by as much as 1.3 percent. Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary, said that some tariffs on China hurt American consumers and businesses, and that cutting tariffs was worth considering in order to lower US inflation.The obstacles to China-US economic and trade cooperation are mainly from the US side. Over 1,000 Chinese companies have been put on its lists for unfair suppression or sanction. The US Congress has put forth more than 300 negative China-related bills. The proposed Bipartisan Innovation Act, which is still being developed, essentially aims to hold back China’s economic growth.◆ The US arbitrarily accuses China of its industrial subsidy policies, but the country itself was among the first to develop such policies, including subsidies and so on. Successive US administrations have rolled out plans to support emerging industries. Through tax relief, government procurement and other means, the US administrations have interfered in the market to push forward cooperation between government and enterprises and advance technology transfers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the US undertook special programs to promote the development of its aerospace and military industries. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration supported the growth of hi-tech industries with the Information Superhighway plan. Such industrial policies are still being practiced in the US today. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the US and its allies and partners in Europe and Asia have increased subsidies to industries such as semiconductors, electric-car batteries and pharmaceuticals to shore up support for domestic companies.◆ The US poses the biggest challenge to the global trading system. Following “America First” policy, the US has refused to shoulder its due obligations under multilateral trading agreements, and withdrawn from international treaties and organizations, taking a heavy toll on the development and functioning of the global trading system. A WTO dispute settlement report has identified the US as the biggest rule-breaker, responsible for two-thirds of violations of WTO rules. The US also blocked the appointment of new judges in the WTO Appellate Body, leading to an impasse in the Appellate Body since December 2019.Falsehood 15: The US will give countries an alternative choice, so that they can be free from opaque investments that leave them in debt.Reality Check: In providing foreign assistance, China always respects the sovereignty of recipient countries, attaches no strings whatsoever and pursues win-win outcomes. Chinese assistance has delivered real benefits to the relevant developing countries and received their acclaim and appreciation.◆ The so-called Chinese “debt trap” is a narrative trap that the US and some other Western countries use to defame and smear China and disrupt China’s cooperation with other developing countries. As a 2021 article in The Atlantic points out, the debt-trap narrative is just a lie fabricated by some Western politicians, and a powerful one.Western capital constitutes the largest creditor of developing countries. According to the 2022 statistics of the World Bank on international debt, 28.8 percent of Africa’s outstanding external debt is owed to multilateral financial institutions and 41.8 percent to commercial creditors mainly composed of Western financial institutions. These two types of institutions together hold nearly three-quarters of the debt, making them the primary creditors of Africa’s debt.According to the director of the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at Johns Hopkins University of the US, after scrutinizing thousands of Chinese loan documents, mostly for projects in Africa, CARI has not found any evidence that China deliberately pushes poor countries into debt as a way of seizing their assets or gaining a greater say in their internal affairs. CARI’s figures show that China holds 17 percent of Africa’s overall external debt, far less than that of the West.Not a single African country has been forced to use its strategic resources such as ports or mines as collateral for financing cooperation with China. DW points out that the default of African countries does not give China the right to use the relevant infrastructure.◆ The debt issue is, in essence, a development issue. The key to resolving this issue lies in ensuring that the loans deliver real benefits.Take Africa as an example. Western countries’ financing for Africa is mainly concentrated in non-production fields, and most loans come with political strings attached, such as human rights and judicial reform. They have failed to truly promote economic development, boost government tax revenue and improve balance of payments. Rather, they have served as instruments for controlling and causing harm in Africa.China always respects the will of the African people and bears in mind the actual needs of African countries. Chinese investment in and financing for Africa are mainly in infrastructure building and production-related fields. Entering the 21st century, China has worked actively to support Africa’s economic development and provided an alternative to the traditional financing channels of the Paris Club. This has helped Africa to strengthen its capacity of self-generated and self-reliant development and to usher in a golden age of high-speed economic growth for 20 years straight.Professor Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University noted the diversification of Chinese investment. In 2014 alone, Chinese companies signed over 70 billion US dollars in construction contracts in Africa that will yield vital infrastructure, including hospitals, oil and gas pipelines, and airports.According to preliminary statistics, between 2000 and 2020, China helped African countries build more than 13,000 kilometers of roads and railway and more than 80 large-scale power facilities, funded more than 130 medical facilities, 45 sports venues and more than 170 schools, and trained more than 160,000 professionals across various fields for Africa.The Nairobi Expressway project built by Chinese companies in Kenya through public-private partnership has created more than 6,000 local jobs and benefited more than 200 subcontractors and several hundred local suppliers. The Kenyan government speaks highly of the project, commending it as an important manifestation of the mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between Kenya and China.Nigeria’s Lekki Deep Sea Port project, built with Chinese participation, has provided more than 1,200 local jobs and is expected to create, directly and indirectly, 170,000 more upon completion.A study conducted by Hong Kong scholars finds that more than 80 percent of the employees of Chinese companies in Africa surveyed are local Africans.A team at the London School of Economics and Political Science finds that Chinese investment in Africa has produced “significant and persistently positive long-term effects”.A study by RAND Corporation indicates that in the BRI region, having a rail connection between trading partners has improved total exports by 2.8 percent.◆ China attaches high importance to the debt sustainability of projects. Back in 2017, it signed the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road with 26 countries participating in the BRI. In 2019, China released the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative. Based on the debt situation and repayment ability of debtor countries, and following the principles of equal-footed consultation, compliance with laws and regulations, openness and transparency, the framework aims to strengthen monitoring and assessment of the economic, social and livelihood benefits of the projects, and channels sovereign loans into areas with high yields, with a view to ensuring the long-term returns of the projects. China has also made proactive efforts to lessen the burden of debtor countries.According to the World Bank, between 2008 and 2021, China provided 71 debt restructurings for low-income countries. In 2020, China actively responded to the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) by suspending the payment of more than 1.3 billion US dollars of debt that year alone, or nearly 30 percent of the G20’s total, making it the largest contributor among G20 members. China has signed debt suspension agreements or reached mutual understanding on debt suspension with 19 African countries, and actively participated in the case-based debt settlement for Chad and Ethiopia under the G20’s Common Framework.◆ The US and some other Western countries, rather than taking actions themselves, point fingers at China for providing assistance. This has caused much displeasure among countries in the wider developing world.Professor Samita Hattige, adviser to the National Education Commission of Sri Lanka, said in an interview with Global Times that Chinese loans are based on the needs of the Sri Lankan government and for the purpose of improving Sri Lankan infrastructure. The loans have brought major changes to Sri Lanka’s economy and people’s livelihood, and there is no such thing as a “debt trap”. China’s share in Sri Lanka’s external debt is around a mere 10 percent. Apparently, some media have chosen to ignore this fact. While the “Chinese debt trap” hyped up by Western media seems apprehensible at a glance, it has deliberately evaded the huge economic values that infrastructure improvement has created, such as economic development and more jobs and investment.The article “Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal Need China for Development” published by Sri Lanka’s Daily News on 17 January 2022 says, “South Asia needs China in its development process because China is synonymous with the term ‘Development’. China’s ... Belt and Road Initiative provides benefits for almost all South Asian countries.” “In the case of Sri Lanka,” the article writes, “Sri Lanka is a beneficiary of Chinese projects. Many say only about the Chinese debt trap in this regard but no one mentions Chinese developmental activities in Sri Lanka.” “They have invested heavily in seaports, airports, ... national highways, and power distribution centers. ”Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni stated in an interview with Nikkei in 2022 that “Africa has been having (debt) problems for the last 600 years due to the slave trade, colonialism, neocolonialism — and none of it was from China.” “China supported Africans’ fight against colonialism before starting economic activity on the continent.”Rwandan President Paul Kagame pointed out that China’s presence in Africa is different from that of other countries — “I don’t think China has forced any country in Africa to take their money to accumulate the kind of debt you may find with some countries.”Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama stated that Nigeria had chosen Chinese companies for infrastructure projects because they were experienced and provide competitive rates. “So the issue of Chinese influence really doesn’t come in.Falsehood 16: For too long, Chinese companies have enjoyed far greater access to our markets than our companies have in China. American companies operating in China have been subject to systematic forced technology transfer, while Chinese companies in America have been protected by our rule of law.Reality Check: China is committed to fostering an enabling business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standard. While China’s business environment keeps improving, the business environment for Chinese companies operating in the US continues to deteriorate.◆ China has seen the most substantial improvement in business environment among all economies. In recent years, China has made continuous efforts to shorten the negative list on foreign investment, improved the institutions for investment promotion and protection and for information reporting, and stepped up intellectual property protection, becoming one of the most-improved economies for ease of doing business. With the continuous improvement in business environment and its super-sized domestic market, China is a strong magnet for cross-border investment from around the world. The number of newly established foreign-invested enterprises is on a steady rise in China. From 2012 to 2021, the number of foreign-invested enterprises in China increased from 441,000 to 664,000, up by over 50 percent. According to the Doing Business 2020 report released by the World Bank Group, China ranked 31st on ease of doing business, moving up by 47 spots in two years. The European Business in China Business Confidence Survey 2021 released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) shows that a majority of the European companies surveyed found intellectual property rights enforcement to be “adequate” or “excellent” in China, marking a record high in satisfaction levels.◆ It is the foreign companies, including the US companies operating in China, that can best tell whether China’s business environment is good or not. The 2022 China Business Climate Survey Report of the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) shows that 58 percent of the US companies in China saw their operating revenue growing in 2021; 66 percent of the companies plan to increase their investment in China this year; and China remains a top-three priority of the global investment planning for 60 percent of the companies. The recently released USCBC 2021 Member Survey shows that 95 percent of the respondents remained profitable in their China operations; and 74 percent of the companies took China as a top priority or a top-five priority market in their business strategy. In the first four months of 2022, the actual US investment in China rose by 53.2 percent year on year. These figures speak volume about the optimism of foreign companies in China’s economic prospects, as well as their recognition of China’s sound business environment and confidence in building a long-term business in the Chinese market.◆ To preserve its hegemony and economic interests, the US has abused its national power in violation of the principles of market economy and international trade rules, and resorted to every possible means to suppress and contain Chinese enterprises. The US government has fabricated all sorts of lies including “forced labor” in an attempt to bring down Xinjiang’s cotton, tomato and solar photovoltaic industries. According to preliminary statistics, in 2021, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued seven Withhold Release Orders (WROs) on the exports of goods made with “forced labor” to the US, including apparel, textiles, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, and other goods made with cotton or tomatoes, silica-based products and electronic products produced in Xinjiang, and detained or confiscated 485 million US dollars worth of goods, which are notably larger in both quantity and value compared to 2020. The current US administration has already outperformed its predecessor in terms of the scale and magnitude of sanctions imposed on China for Xinjiang-related issues.◆ The US has imposed sweeping restrictions on the financing and operation of Chinese enterprises in the US through non-transparent and unfair administrative means. According to official US statistics, the US has up to now put 1,055 Chinese entities and individuals (overseas affiliated entities excluded) on various types of sanctions lists, including 467 on the Entity List, 306 on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN), 201 on the Unverified List (UVL), 68 on the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) List, and a few other entities. Last February, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) put WeChat and AliExpress on its latest Notorious Markets List, while Pinduoduo and other Chinese companies as well as nine physical markets located within China remained on the list.Falsehood 17: China takes advantage of the openness of the US economies to spy, to hack, to steal technology and know-how to advance China’s military innovation, entrench its surveillance state and increase other countries’ technological dependence. The US should make sure that technologies are rooted in democratic values.Reality check: China’s technological innovation and development is based on its own investment and efforts. The US is drawing ideological lines in scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, and this embodies its Cold War mentality.◆ China is a big innovator in the world with leading input and growth rate in innovation. According to statistics, China’s social R&D investment in 2021 reached 2.7864 trillion yuan, an increase of 14.2 percent over the previous year. A total of 696,000 invention patents were authorized in 2021, up by 31.3 percent year-on-year. The Global Innovation Index (GII) 2021 published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows that China’s world innovation performance ranking has moved up from the 35th place to the 12th. China is now home to 19 of the top 100 science and technology clusters worldwide, ranking the second globally. Chinese applicants submitted 69,500 international patent applications, making China the first in the world for three consecutive years. The European Patent Office (EPO) recorded 16,665 applications from China in 2021, registering a year-on-year increase of 24 percent and the biggest surge among leading patent filing countries.◆ In recent years, China has been actively integrating into the global science and technology innovation network, and has enjoyed fruitful results in technological and people-to-people exchanges under the BRI. In addition, China has also actively worked to join the Hague Agreement and the Marrakesh Treaty, contributing its share to the global governance of intellectual property rights. The Business Confidence Survey 2021 published by the EUCCC shows that over half of interviewed companies view intellectual property rights enforcement in China as “adequate” or “excellent”.◆ Throughout history, the US has repeatedly stolen intellectual properties and reaped dividends from technological developments through various means, including prying out information, offering immigration status and monopolizing patents.After World War II, the US launched Operation Paperclip to plunder Germany of its technology patents, including those on advanced aircraft and guided missile control. Nearly all German government agencies, research and development institutes and large companies were looted, and German scientists were forced to immigrate to the US.In the 1990s, US intelligence agencies installed eavesdropping devices in the cars of Japanese negotiators during automobile trade talks to intercept internal information and gain the upper hand in the negotiations.In 2001, the European company Airbus sued the American company Boeing for tracking Airbus employees’ telephone, fax, and e-mails for business espionage using the electronic surveillance system named Echelon developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA).In 2013, the US DOJ detained four Alstom executives to force the French company into a fire sale of its core business, power and grid, to the US company General Electric.In 2021, Danish media exposed that the US NSA wiretapped senior officials and business leaders in European countries using internet facilities located in Denmark.In addition, using “chip shortages” as an excuse, the US has also set deadlines to force leading chip makers from different countries to submit key information, including orders, clients and inventory, in an effort to turn the table in the chip sector.◆ While claiming to uphold “peace” and “openness”, the US has been wantonly setting up technological barriers, piecing together the so-called “democratic technology alliance”, politicizing science and technology and turning them into ideological issues, and forming exclusive small circles. Identifying nearly 20 categories as controlled critical technologies, including biotechnology and artificial intelligence, the US has tightened up export control and investment scrutiny. It has also overstretched the concept of national security to contain and even stranglehold the development of high-tech industries in other countries, which severely violates the rights of developing countries in pursuing science and technology advancement.Falsehood 18: Climate is not about ideology. It’s about math. If China sticks with its current plan and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the rest of the world must go to zero by 2035. And that’s simply not possible.Reality Check: The US holds undeniable responsibilities for climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. It shouldn’t shift responsibilities onto others, nor should it practice “double standards”.◆ Developed countries, due to their unconstrained emissions over more than two centuries of industrialization, bear undeniable historical responsibilities for climate change. From 1850 to 2011, developed countries contributed to 79 percent of global carbon emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement all require developed countries to repay their historical debts.◆ From a historical perspective, developing countries are not the primary emitters of GHG, but the victims of climate change. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the cornerstone of global climate governance. As developed and developing countries do not bear the same historical responsibilities for climate change, and have different development needs and capabilities, it would be both inappropriate and unfair to apply the same restrictions on them. Wera Mori, Minister for Environment Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea (PNG) said on the sidelines of COP26 that countries like PNG have become victims of climate change caused by the industrialization of developed countries and are now bearing the consequences of their actions, which is absolutely unfair.◆ In tackling climate change, China is not just a responsible participant, but also a serious doer. President Xi Jinping committed explicitly that China will strive to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. That means China will move from carbon peak to neutrality in only 30 years, while the time the EU, the US and Japan give themselves is respectively 2.4, 1.4 and 1.2 times of China’s.China has made notable contribution to the global efforts in energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and building, which are all in the range of 30 to 50 percent. By the end of 2020, China’s CO2 emissions per unit of GDP had dropped by 48.4 percent relative to the 2005 level. The proportion of coal in total energy consumption fell from 67 percent in 2005 to 56.8 percent in 2020. The cumulative installed capacity of renewable power generation exceeded 1 billion kilowatts, accounting for 43.5 percent of the national total. Chinese companies have taken 15 spots in the world’s top 20 PV companies list, including all the top five spots, and seven spots in the top 10 wind power companies list. In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of coal-fired power generation capacity, which is larger than the total installed power capacity of the UK. By the end of 2021, China’s new energy vehicle ownership had exceeded 7.84 million units, and 2.95 million units were newly registered in 2021, accounting for 11.25 percent of all newly registered vehicles that year.The share of renewable energy in China’s energy mix has already exceeded that of the US. By the end of 2019, the total installed capacity of China’s hydro, wind and solar power generation had reached 756 million kilowatts, 2.8 times that of the US. Renewable energy accounts for 12.7 percent of China’s primary energy consumption, approximately 1.4 times that of the US.◆ The US is the world’s largest GHG emitter in cumulative terms, and its per capita carbon emissions are 3.3 times that of the global average. In the 270 years from 1750 to 2019, the US emitted a cumulative 412.5 billion tons of GHG, accounting for about 1/4 of the global total. The US has produced the world’s largest cumulative emissions, which are almost twice that of China’s. Here are some statistics: the historical peak of US per capita GHG emissions was 23.44 tons; in 2018, US per capita emissions were 16.85 tons, while China’s were 7.56 tons. Despite its status as a major manufacturing nation, China’s current per capita carbon emissions are not even half that of the US, and its per capita cumulative emissions are only around 1/8 that of the US. Even by the time of 2030, when China’s carbon emissions will have peaked, the country’s per capita carbon emissions will still just be around 7-8 tons. In comparison, when the US had its carbon peak in 2005, its per capita carbon emissions had already reached 14 tons.◆ In June 2017, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and in November 2020, it officially pulled out of the accord. Such a move seriously undermined the equity, efficiency and efficacy of global climate governance. The US had stayed outside the Paris Agreement until February 2021. Despite the improvement in political posture, the GHG emissions generated simply cannot be rolled back. Instead of cutting emissions, the US produced more emissions in 2021 than 2020, drifting further away from the course set by the Paris Agreement. With its flip-flopping on such an existential issue, the US has fully exposed its utilitarian approach to major issues of principles and lost its credibility in the family of nations.◆ It is the unshirkable moral responsibility of developed countries to provide funding for developing countries to help them better cope with climate change. At Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancún in 2010, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilizing jointly 100 billion US dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. More than ten years have passed, developed countries have never truly delivered on their commitment. Report by a well-known international think tank shows that not only did developed countries fall short of their collective climate financing target every year, they also juggled the figures, providing far less funds than officially released figures. Most notably, the US only fulfilled less than 20 percent of its due contribution.◆ For years, the US has been saying publicly that it wants to work with China on climate change, but its actions say otherwise. While demanding China to consume less coal, it asks China to continue buying coal from it; while appealing for the development of renewable energies, it imposes sanctions on Chinese PV businesses. Take PV products as an example, starting from 2012, the US has imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese PV products, with rates as high as 34 to 47 percent. In December 2014, the US conducted anti-dumping and countervailing investigations on Chinese PV manufacturers. In January 2018, the previous US administration decided to slap global safeguard tariffs on 8.5 billion US dollars’ worth of solar panel imports. In late 2021, the so-called “Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act” was signed into law by the US, which is yet another attempt to hobble the PV industry in Xinjiang under the disguise of human rights. Relevant US measures have not only impeded normal trade in PV products and disrupted normal supply chains, but also undermined global efforts in countering climate change. The US should correct its wrong practices in order to create an enabling environment for climate cooperation with China.◆ Climate change has caused serious challenges to human survival and development, and must be tackled through global cooperation. Developed countries, the US included, should honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and follow the requirements of the Paris Agreement. They need to face up to their historical responsibilities, and level up their ambitions and actions. They need to take the lead in making substantial reductions of emissions and strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. In the meantime, they need to give developing countries due space for development and emission, and deliver on their commitments of providing developing countries with adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support. On the basis of meeting financing pledges and leveraging public funds, efforts can be made to promote the development of green finance and bring private investment into low-carbon sectors. It is also important to build national, regional and global carbon markets and carbon pricing mechanisms, bring down the costs and raise the level of emissions reductions, promote technological innovation and sustainable development, and provide developing countries with stable sources of funding for mitigation and capacity-building through the benefit sharing mechanism of carbon markets.Falsehood 19: To counter illegal and illicit narcotics, especially synthetic opioids like fentanyl, we want to work with China to stop international drug trafficking organizations from getting precursor chemicals, many of which originate in China.Reality Check: The US has itself to blame for the root cause of fentanyl abuse in the country.◆ Narcotics abuse, a chronic malaise plaguing the US, has deep historical and social roots.With five percent of the world’s population, the US consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, making the country the world’s biggest market for narcotics. There is a prevalent tradition of prescription painkiller abuse in the US, undergirded by a complete chain of pharmaceutical companies, medical representatives and doctors. All-out marketing by pharmaceutical companies, over-prescription by doctors, ineffective government crackdowns and the negative implications of marijuana legalization are among the combination of factors behind an ever-growing market for narcotics. Opioid abuse in the US and its rising toll started with OxyContin, an opioid painkiller made by Purdue Pharma and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995. When it comes to discouraging demand and curbing production, the US should have done a lot more.While the US has the most acute fentanyl challenge in the world, it is also the biggest producer and consumer of fentanyl and has yet to officially schedule fentanyl-related substances as a class. Nevertheless, it kept demanding other countries to take actions. This is a typical example of “forcing others to take medicine for one’s own illness”.◆The Chinese government takes a zero-tolerance approach to narcotics and strictly regulates anesthetics, psychotropic substances and their precursors. By the end of 2021, China has added 37 drug precursors and ephedrine-related substances to its control list, which became even longer than the UN list. China strictly regulates import and export of chemicals pursuant to international rules and its domestic laws, and its efforts and achievements in this regard are visible to all.On 1 May 2019, the Chinese government became the first country in the world to class schedule fentanyl-related substances, although there was no large-scale fentanyl abuse or immediate hazard in China. This is an important follow-up to the common understandings reached between the presidents of China and the US, and a concrete example of how China, keeping in mind the health, safety and well-being of humanity, actively responds to the US concern and helps it tackle its domestic opioid crisis.On 1 July 2021, China class scheduled all synthetic cannabinoids and another 18 psychoactive substances including fluoroketamine. On 20 September of the same year, another six chemicals, including methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate (MAPA), were added as drug precursors. China is making continuous efforts to regulate precursors in accordance with law.China has taken a host of measures to crack down on the trafficking of fentanyl and other scheduled chemicals, like introducing real-name registration of senders and receivers, parcel examination and X-ray screening in the express delivery sector, and stepping up examination of cross-border parcels to certain destinations including the US. These measures have paid off.After class scheduling fentanyl-related substances, China’s National Narcotics Control Commission and Ministry of Public Security have maintained close, candid and in-depth coordination with their US counterparts including the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Since September 2019, the US has not seized any fentanyl-related substances coming from China. The US has expressed appreciation to China on many occasions and noted drug control as a highlight in bilateral law enforcement cooperation.As is known to all, the responsibility to prevent the entry of non-scheduled chemicals and their use in illicit drug-making falls on the import country. The US, however, would neither officially schedule fentanyl nor address the issue of domestic consumption. Instead, it chose to shift the blame by falsely claiming that “fentanyl precursors used by drug trafficking organizations originate in China” and making an issue out of non-scheduled chemicals. This reflects an ulterior motive and an extreme lack of responsibility for the life and health of its own people.◆ In May 2020, without producing any evidence, the US added the Institute of Forensic Science of China’s Ministry of Public Security and the National Narcotics Laboratory to its “Entity List”. Such a practice of seeking China’s cooperation on the one hand while imposing sanctions on China’s narcotics control authorities has seriously hindered the operation of China’s fentanyl monitoring system and undermined the counter-narcotics cooperation between China and the US.While China and the rest of the world are tightening control over fentanyl-related substances, fentanyl-related problems are deteriorating in the US, causing a mounting death toll. It lays bare the US’s failure to get to the crux of the fentanyl abuse problem. China has acted out of goodwill and repeatedly advised the US to follow effective practices widely recognized by the international community, like stepping up regulation on fentanyl prescription and promoting public awarenessFalsehood 20: As a global food crisis threatens people worldwide, we look to China — a country that’s achieved great things in agriculture — to help with a global response. Reality Check: The US has long been restricting grain exports and monopolizing grain trade. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US expanded its arms assistance and abused unilateral sanctions, further aggravating the global food shortage. It bears unshirkable responsibility for the global food crisis.◆ The US-driven deglobalization, its grain-for-energy production policies and food oligopolies are the root causes of global food crisis.Using its status as a major grain-producer, the US has been restricting its grain exports to other countries, causing disruptions to normal global grain trade. The 12 major grain producers such as the US, Canada and the European Union accounts for 70percent of the world’s total grain production and exportation. In global trade relations, the US and other Western countries weigh heavily on whether developing countries can buy grain and at what price.The US consumes grain to produce biofuels, straining global food supply, especially the supply of subsistence crops. Nearly one-third of the corn produced in the US is used for biofuels. Using grain as substitute for energy leads to fewer grain for global food supply, creating a vicious circle of food and energy prices pushing up each other.The four major grain suppliers —ADM, Bunge and Cargill and Louis Dreyfus — monopolize more than 80percent of the world’s grain trade, and control global agricultural raw materials as well as grain production, processing and supply. These four grain suppliers, three from the US, manipulate the international prices of grain and earn extra profits from global food price volatility. Since 2021, their net income has increased by 53 percent, 80 percent, 64 percent and 47.7 percent respectively, and the stock prices of ADM and Bunge have nearly tripled. These international food oligopolies are profit-seeking, and they won’t miss any opportunity to stir up food security issues and inflate food supply shortage to make bigger profits.◆ The US has been stoking the flames in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and abusing economic sanctions. These have exacerbated global food shortage.The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a direct consequence of the constant instigation by the US and other Western countries. US military and arms assistance to Ukraine has increased to 53.6 billion US dollars, more than 70 percent of the combined military spending of Russia and Ukraine in 2021. The longer and bigger the conflict is, the greater its impact on global food production and supply will be, and the food crisis will further intensify.In the face of a global food crisis, major grain-producing countries such as the US have instead kept their “grain bags” tight. According to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report released by the US Department of Agriculture this May, US wheat exports in 2021/22 will be 18.9 percent lower than the previous year. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the total amount of food exports affected by the restrictions has increased significantly, which now represents about 17 percent of total calories traded in the worldThe US food security initiative is more of empty words than concrete actions, only to fragment global food security governance. Russia is a major exporter of subsistence crops and the world’s largest exporter of fertilizers. Since the US and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, the price index of various fertilizers has risen by more than 30 percent, which has seriously affected agricultural production. From 2021 to 2022, wheat and barley exports from Russia account for 16 percent and 12.9 percent of the world’s total respectively. Statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) show that since the US imposed sanctions on Russia, the Food Price Index in May this year has risen by 14 percent compared with February.◆ Serious food waste in the US has worsened the global food shortage.First, the amount of food waste is astounding. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the US, 30 to 40 percent of the food supply and 38 percent of grain products are never eaten each year. In 2018, the US had 103 million tons of its food wasted, worth 161 billion US dollars. In 2020, the country’s food waste per capita was 59 kilograms.Second, distribution is uneven. About 38 million people are food insecure in the US in 2020, and the majority of them are African Americans, Latin Americans and Native Americans. According to National Geographic, more than one-third of the low-income households do not have access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program introduced by the US government, and its benefits fall short of helping many families in high-cost areas enjoy a healthy and adequate diet.Third, secondary problems are prominent. Every year, the overproduction of food in the US puts a staggering burden on the environment and wastes numerous resources, including over 9.3 million hectares of arable land, 22 trillion liters of water, 350 million kilograms of pesticides, and 6.35 million tons of chemical fertilizers.◆ China has made significant contributions to global food security. It has supported one-fifth of the world’s population with a quarter of the world’s total food, on less than 9 percent of the world’s arable land. The Global Development Initiative put forward by China has identified food security as one of the eight priority areas of cooperation. China will mobilize efforts from all parties across the globe to draw on each other’s strength, and form the greatest synergy to meet all sustainable development goals including food security. This initiative has received positive response from more than 100 countries around the world and international organizations such as the UN.◆ The Chinese people cherish food and keep to the traditional virtue of thrift. President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to food security. He has called for thriftiness and opposes squandering, stressing on multiple occasions the need to stop food waste. Since the launch of the nationwide “Clear Your Plate” campaign in 2013, consumer food waste in China has been significantly reduced. According to the Nature magazine, the amount of food discarded by Chinese restaurants and eateries has decreased by 40 percent. In 2021, the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste hosted by China was well received by the international community, including members of the G20.◆ China is an important strategic partner of FAO in South-South cooperation. In recent years, China has donated 130 million US dollars to the FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund. China has sent more than 1,100 agricultural experts and technical personnel to and trained nearly 100,000 farmers in more than 40 countries and regions. Under the framework of the FAO’s South-South Cooperation Programme, China has donated the largest amount of fund, sent the most experts, and undertaken the most projects among all developing countries.◆ China has provided its own solutions to global food shortage. Chinese hybrid rice is being grown in dozens of countries and regions in Asia, Africa and the Americas, with an annual growth area of eight million hectares. This increased the world’s total grain output by 150 million tons, enough to feed 400 to 500 million more people. Yuan Longping, known as the “Father of Chinese Hybrid Rice”, and other Chinese researchers have offered advice and counsel in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and many other countries. Through international training courses, China has trained over 14,000 hybrid rice technicians for more than 80 developing countries.Falsehood 21: Beijing has perfected mass surveillance and exported that technology to more than 80 countries.Reality Check: The US is the biggest empire of hacking.◆ The use of video surveillance and big data technology is an important step taken by the Chinese government to improve social governance, and also a common practice across the world. It is necessary, legal and justified. Tianwang (Skynet), which is composed of video surveillance systems, effectively eliminates potential risks to public security and ensures the high percentage of solved criminal cases in China. With the increasingly digitized crime prevention and control system, 98.6 percent of the people in China felt safe in 2021, and China is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China ranked the third in the law and order index published by Gallup, a US consulting company, while the US 36th.◆ Statistics show that there were some 70 million cameras installed in the US in 2018, one for every 4.6 people. For the US to accuse China of mass surveillance, it’s just double standard at work.◆ For a long time, the US has carried out large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber espionage, surveillance and attacks on foreign governments, enterprises and individuals in violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. In June 2013, the Guardian and the Washington Post reported that NSA has been running PRISM, a clandestine electronic surveillance program, since 2007, whose targets include even its own allies. Der Spiegel reported that the US intelligence may have been monitoring the German Chancellor’s mobile phone communications for nearly a decade.◆ In 2020, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) demanded Facebook to stop sending data of EU users to the US. The report comes just a few months after the European Court of Justice ruled the data transfer standard between the EU and the US doesn’t adequately protect European citizen’s privacy and concluded that EU citizens had no effective way to challenge US government surveillance. It is reported that US agencies such as NSA can theoretically ask internet companies like Facebook and Google to hand over data on an EU citizen and that EU citizen would be none-the-wiser.◆ In December 2020, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) of France stated that google.fr and amazon.fr websites violated relevant French regulations by placing tracking cookies on their users’ computers without obtaining prior consent and without providing adequate information.◆ In 2021, Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) reported that between 2012 and 2014, NSA used information cables of Denmark to wiretap (spy on) senior officials of Sweden, Norway, France and Germany, including many political dignitaries such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The US apparently broke its promise that it would stop wiretapping Merkel.◆ The US abuses its leading position in internet and communication technology and is truly an empire of hacking, tapping and theft of secrets. From PRISM, the Irritant Horn project, and Stellar Wind, to Operation Telescreen, the Hive platform and the QUANTUM attack system, the US has violated the freedom of communication and speech of its citizens through digital surveillance, and has engaged in cyber attacks, surveillance and thefts of secrets across the world. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden of the Stateroom program show that the US has covertly installed eavesdropping devices in nearly 100 of its embassies and consulates to steal secrets from their host countries.◆ A report on APT-C-39 released by Chinese cybersecurity company 360 in 2020 reveals that APT-C-39, a hacking group under the CIA, has conducted cyber infiltration attacks on China for 11 years targeting critical sectors including aviation and aerospace, research institutions, oil industry, large internet companies, and government agencies. Such attacks have seriously undermined China’s national security and the security of its economy, critical infrastructure as well as personal information of the general public.According to a report on the indiscriminate worldwide cyber attacks by NSA’s APT-C-40 over the past decade released by 360 in 2022, NSA has attacked, using cyber weapons, 403 targets in 47 countries and regions worldwide, including China, the UK, Germany, France, Poland, Japan, India, the ROK, the UAE, South Africa and Brazil.On 19 April 2022, China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) issued an alert on cyber attacks by the US government against other countries and released a related report. It brings to light “Hive”, a lightweight cyber weapon used exclusively by the US government, and the fact that the US has deployed cyber attack platforms worldwide and has jumper servers and VPN channels in countries like France, Germany, Canada, Turkey and Malaysia.Source: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0620/c90000-10111762.html,20,6,2022,"['china', 'countries', 'international', 'rights', 'government', 'hong', 'kong', 'development', 'security', 'global', 'human', 'years', 'democracy', 'law', 'including', 'economic', 'million', 'national', 'taiwan', 'political']",0.34982963889601126,0.06536677260792313,20/6/2022

(Photo by Zeng Hui/Xinhua)The numbers follow years of surging firearm sales. Yet they also underscore a longstanding tension in the system.NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The FBI has been issuing more seizure orders for guns sold to suspected prohibited buyers than at any time in the history of the U.S. federal firearm background check system, USA Today reported on Sunday.More than 6,300 such referrals were transmitted to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives in 2020 to take back weapons from buyers when background checks later determined they may have been ineligible because of criminal records, mental health histories, disqualifying military service records and other bans, said the report, citing the most recent data compiled by the FBI.An additional 5,200 directives were issued in 2021, adding to the largest two-year total by far since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System began publishing data in 1998.The numbers follow years of surging firearm sales. Yet they also underscore a longstanding tension in the system: Federally licensed dealers are permitted to proceed with weapons sales in cases when background checks are not completed within the required three business days, according to the report.Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, was quoted as saying that the historic surge in firearm purchases in the United States was ""spurred by the combination of the onset of a scary pandemic, concerns about disruptions to the economy and social order, widespread protests against police violence, some violent and destructive, talks of defunding the police, historic increases in murders and one of the most hostile political environments in our nation´s history.""""The FBI likely did not have the human resources needed to keep up with the surge in background checks for firearm purchases. So it´s a lot more people buying guns and insufficient resources to complete the background checks and deny prohibited persons,"" he said.Seizure orders are issued when analysts later conclude that buyers likely should have been barred. The FBI noted that the retrieval orders represent a fraction of the millions of gun checks processed in 2020 and 2021.

Op-ed: “Chinese Debt Trap” in Sri Lanka an unfounded accusation - People's Daily Online,"Op-ed: “Chinese Debt Trap” in Sri Lanka an unfounded accusationBy Mohan Munasinghe (People´s Daily Online) 14:38, June 08, 2022Editor’s note:The debt crisis in Sri Lanka has gained international attention in the last few days. Some Western media outlets have revived the ""Chinese Debt Trap"" (CDT) theories again, claiming that China enticed Sri Lanka to engage in large-scale borrowing to build redundant infrastructure, resulting in the latter´s debt crisis. Professor Mohan Munasinghe, a well-known scholar from Sri Lanka, responded to such accusations by pointing out that such claims are greatly exaggerated. At the same time, China, a country that has been an important trading partner of Sri Lanka, can help the country recover from the current debt crisis. He also noted that ongoing BRI-related projects, such as the recently completed Colombo Port City project, have the potential to attract FDI and boost Sri Lanka´s economic growth.Professor Mohan Munasinghe is the recipient of the 2021 Blue Planet Prize, and former vice chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that shared the 2007 Nobel Prize for Peace. He is also chairman of the presidential expert commission on the Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision, and distinguished guest professor at Peking University, China.Aerial photo taken on Dec. 2, 2021 shows a panoramic view of Colombo´s Port City in Sri Lanka. (China´s CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd./Handout via Xinhua)The so-called ""Chinese Debt Trap"" theories are certainly exaggerated, as only 10% of Sri Lanka´s debt is held by the Chinese government. China’s contribution to Sri Lanka’s current crisis is marginal.According to the External Resources Department of Sri Lanka, in 2019, by far the largest proportion of debt (almost 50%) was owed to international sovereign bond (ISB) holders, mainly US-based funds and banks. Japan, China and India held 10%, 10% and 2% respectively of Sri Lankan debt, and the remaining part was owed to others, including multilateral banks including the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.Another relevant factor is the payment structure of bonds, which can pose a challenge to a debt distressed country, especially when payments have to be re-negotiated to avoid default – both the periodic debt service and the principal at the time of maturity. ISB repayments, which make up around a quarter of Sri Lanka’s annual debt servicing, are the most problematic, because unlike bilateral and multilateral debt, they cannot be easily renegotiated or restructured.We can easily deduce from a closer look at Sri Lanka´s current debt crisis that the country´s economic dysfunction has multiple reasons-not only external, but also internal.Externally, Sri Lanka´s debt crisis was worsened by high global inflation and economic contraction linked to movement of the US dollar. Sri Lanka’s success in graduating from low-income to lower-middle-income status in 2009 pushed the country to wean itself off multilateral and bilateral concessional loans, and access costlier international capital markets for its fiscal needs. This caused greater USD exposure and, hence, greater exchange rates risk. Currently around two thirds of debt is USD denominated. As discussed in Q1, ISBs have grown to be the country´s single largest and most expensive debt burden. Chronic external balance of payments deficits and internal budget deficits, coupled with excessive printing of money to bridge deficits have all contributed to the recent severe depreciation of rupee – during the past six months (Dec. 2021 to May 2022), the value of the Sri Lankan rupee (LKR) has almost halved against the USD.Internally, strategic mistakes by the Sri Lanka authorities have also led to the debt crisis. Unlike China and India, whose rapid growth resulted in large trade surpluses, huge foreign reserves and investments, Sri Lanka’s growth from low to middle income status was accompanied by massive trade deficits, inadequate foreign reserves, large scale borrowing, high fiscal deficits, unproductive public investments, increases in public debt and heavy debt servicing costs. Sri Lanka failed to invest proactively in manufacturing and high-end exports while foreign borrowing has been mainly used to close the gaps in the country’s trade deficit and cover public expenditure. High-interest financing has gone into funding the welfare state, public infrastructure, and a 30-year war, as well as consumption (lifestyle-based) driven by markets and advertising -- thus exposing the country to greater exchange rate risk. All these factors have weakened long term growth prospects.In the short term (since 2020), bad policy decisions were also made like seeking to change to organic fertilizers overnight (that collapsed domestic agriculture), huge tax concessions to the wealthy (that reduced domestic resource mobilization), and overusing foreign borrowings for domestic essential consumption (rather than productive investments). This drastically reduced our macroeconomic resilience, just at the very moment the global economy weakened due to external shocks like Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Beyond the usual “middle income trap”, Sri Lanka appears to be in a “middle income debt-trap”, partly of her own-making!Nevertheless, Sri Lanka has been a success story in the developing country context for maintaining high standards of human welfare indicators (approaching developed country levels), through its spending on free education and health care. The failure was in building on this platform of educated youth and healthy population, to transition to a more productive economy based increasingly on manufacturing and high-value export earnings. As Sri Lanka takes strong measures to restore the economy, protecting the poor must remain a high priority, while we strive to maintain the balance between welfare and support of growth-oriented, market mechanisms.As a scholar from Sri Lanka, I am optimistic about the nation´s future growth. With improved governance, better political stability and help from friendly countries like China, the macroeconomic situation can recover within 1-2 years, because the underlying Sri Lankan economy has proved to be quite resilient even during past crises. In that context, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is important for recovery from the current crisis and for promoting future growth and sustainable development prospects. The Presidential Expert Commission (PEC) that prepared the 2019 report on “Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision and Strategic Path”, warned about the impending debt crisis, recommended sound remedial measures, and pointed out a long term, comprehensive recovery strategy based on balanced inclusive green growth (BIGG), including the BRI. Implementing such recommendations will help to reverse many years of neglecting planning and ensuring policy consistency, as well as lack of ground-level implementation. It is indeed a hopeful sign that there is a strong professional-youth-student-based movement, supported by a major proportion of the Sri Lankan population, which is pushing for sensible, systemic reform and good governance.In the current shifting geopolitical landscape, where a multipolar world order is emerging, Sri Lanka can benefit from, and encourage greater global reliance on soft economic power (versus hard military interventions), and shift to multiple global currencies (away from USD dominance). Given our serious economic problems, Sri Lanka must seek the right balance in foreign policy, following our traditional non-aligned path (friend of all, foe of none). This will help us obtain help from all our friends, including China who has been a steadfast supporter since the famous 1952 Rubber-Rice Pact between the two countries (which was opposed by the USA, at that time). There are ongoing BRI-related projects, like the recently completed Colombo Port City project, which have the potential to attract FDI, boost growth, and restore our economy. There are lessons to be learned also from the Hambantota Port project, which has fallen short of expectations. If we manage our recovery successfully and follow the balanced inclusive green growth (BIGG) path, the BRI can make a very positive overall contribution. Enable GingerCannot connect to Ginger Check your internet connectionor reload the browserDisable in this text fieldRephraseRephrase current sentenceEdit in Ginger×Enable GingerCannot connect to Ginger Check your internet connectionor reload the browserDisable in this text fieldRephraseRephrase current sentenceEdit in Ginger×Enable GingerCannot connect to Ginger Check your internet connectionor reload the browserDisable in this text fieldRephraseRephrase current sentenceEdit in Ginger×",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/0608/c90000-10107112.html,8,6,2022,"['sri', 'lanka', 'debt', 'country', 'growth', 'crisis', 'china', 'current', 'high', 'ginger', 'trap', 'bri', 'port', 'economic', 'based', 'income', 'deficits', 'foreign', 'economy', 'colombo']",0.3673971139971139,0.06760541125541125,8/6/2022

The order by the Germans of F-35 from the American manufacturer Lockheed Martin drew great attention to the ""Franco-German estrangement"", she added.Mathieu also pointed out Europe´s dependence on Ukrainian corn. As harvests were less abundant in Ukraine, American producers began to export corn to Europe.The energy crisis is also pushing European companies to relocate to the United States, where the supply of energy is guaranteed and cheaper.""Washington´s unwavering support for Ukraine makes the United States the big winner in the global stage without a single soldier needing to set foot onto Ukrainian soil,"" with undeniable geostrategic, economic, military and political gains, she said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1126/c90000-10176687.html,26,11,2022,"['american', 'ukraine', 'french', 'united', 'states', 'gas', 'industry', 'europe', 'makes', 'profits', 'conflict', 'journalist', 'liquefied', 'natural', 'arms', 'export', 'mathieu', 'military', 'european', 'ukrainian']",0.17460317460317457,0.06587301587301587,26/11/2022

Chinese Consul General in San Francisco Zhang Jianmin, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, and others were present to witness.The Year of the Rabbit zodiac commemorative stamp is one of three rounds of Lunar Zodiac stamps that have been issued in the United States. Camille Zhou, a Chinese-American illustrator, designed the Year of the Rabbit stamp.(Photo/United States Postal Service)On the stamp, a green crown sits between the little Rabbit’s two towering ears, and four purple tassels hang from green flowers on both sides of its forehead, which is consistent with the tassels on the stamps of the previous three years. The geometric figures from the forehead to the bridge of the nose include moons and stars, which can quickly remind people who are familiar with Chinese culture of the Moon Palace, a folklore which features a jade rabbit.The U.S. Postal Service has praised its ""contemporary interpretation of this auspicious time of year using the long-traditional folk craft of paper-cutting.""The red text below the U.S. Year of the Rabbit stamp reads ""Lunar New Year,"" the gold text reads ""Forever USA,"" and the year ""2023"" is marked on the upper right corner of the stamp.USPS has designed a digital color first-day postmark option for this set of stamps and a free black and white first-day postmark within 50 stamps.""

"China, US chart a path forward for bilateral ties - People's Daily Online","China, US chart a path forward for bilateral tiesBy XU WEI in Bali, Indonesia and ZHAO HUANXIN in Washington (China Daily) 10:44, November 16, 2022President Xi Jinping meets with US President Joe Biden on Monday in Bali, Indonesia. LI XUEREN/XINHUAThe first face-to-face meeting between President Xi Jinping and United States President Joe Biden has charted the path for improving ties between the world´s two largest economies and bringing stability and certainty to a turbulent and volatile world, officials and analysts said.The two leaders greeted each other on Monday with a smile and a warm handshake before holding a meeting that lasted for over three hours — longer than scheduled and using simultaneous interpretation — on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia.Xi and Biden emphasized the global implications of China-US relations, underscored the importance of establishing guiding principles for bilateral ties and said they hoped to push the relations back to a steady track from a downward spiral, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a news briefing after the meeting.They agreed to bolster dialogue and exchanges and promote pragmatic cooperation, which charted the way forward for the relations and will help bring the ties gradually back to a track of healthy and stable development, Wang said.The meeting came months after Beijing broke off a number of routine contacts with Washington after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi´s visit to Taiwan, which took bilateral relations to a historic low level.Wang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said the meeting made clear that both sides should prevent the relations from losing direction or speed, still less having a collision, and should find the right way to get along.The two leaders also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue, with the Chinese president underscoring the urgency of a peaceful settlement of the crisis.""In all, the meeting reached its expected purpose of in-depth communication, clarifying intentions, drawing red lines, preventing conflicts, pointing the way forward and exploring cooperation,"" Wang said.The two leaders agreed that both sides will conduct dialogue over macroeconomic policies and bilateral trade, and enable positive outcomes from the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27.They also highlighted the need to implement the cooperation document on public health and agriculture and expand people-to-people exchanges in various sectors.Erik Solheim, former undersecretary general of the United Nations, said the meeting between Xi and Biden went beyond expectations, given that China-US relations are critical for world peace and the environment.""This is the best global news for a long time,"" he said. ""China-US relations are not a zero-sum game. The world is big enough for them to prosper together.""Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said on Monday that amid the current atmosphere of bilateral tension, the meeting underlined the importance of the bilateral relationship to the two countries and the world.""Regular and close bilateral contact is indispensable for responsibly managing competition, lowering the temperature of the relationship, and working together to address issues of shared interest,"" he said.The US-China Business Council, which represents more than 280 US companies that do business with China, fully supports Washington´s and Beijing´s mutual interest in seeking to stabilize relations and working collaboratively as global leaders as much as possible, Allen said in a statement.""We hope a new framework can take shape to advance confidence-building measures and tackle long-standing issues in the bilateral relationship,"" he added.Allen said he hoped that commercial issues will be on the agenda when cabinet-level officials from both countries hold further discussions.A commitment to open lines of communication at all official levels, Biden´s declaration to avoid a new Cold War, and a joint renunciation of nuclear threats are the three best outcomes of the summit, said Gary Hufbauer, a former US Treasury Department official and nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.""From a business perspective, these announcements should reduce fears of a continuing downward spiral in US-China relations,"" Hufbauer told China Daily.Regarding priorities for follow-up in the areas of business and trade, in order to implement the consensuses reached between Biden and Xi, Hufbauer said the first order of business should be to dismantle the tariffs imposed by the administration of former US president Donald Trump on imports from China, with reciprocal dismantling by China.The second order of business should be to draw lines around ""national security"" industrial sectors so that this label is not used to restrict an ever-widening scope of bilateral trade, he said.Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies' Department of American Studies, said the two presidents' sit-down was constructive and conveyed a clear message that it is important for both nations to avoid misjudgment.""Beijing has made clear proposals for the steady and healthy growth of ties with Washington, and the US must meet China halfway,"" she said, adding that China has again clarified its bottom line in the relationship, especially in safeguarding sovereignty and security and development interests.Douglas H. Paal, a distinguished fellow in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that reestablishing working groups is positive for improving bilateral relations, because they helped resolve practical problems in Biden´s first year.With US Secretary of State Antony Blinken planning to travel to China for follow-up discussions, communication should be more regular, Paal said.Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, said the meeting reestablished a baseline of in-person, leader-led communications, restarted senior official-level dialogue channels and was an attempt by the leaders to reassure each other about their strategic intentions.He said that, as a proverb goes, the proof of the pudding will be in its eating.""The problem, after all, is not a lack of positively expressed intentions... but the inability or unwillingness to translate these intentions into actual policy at the US end,"" Gupta said. ""So we will have to wait and see how the 'pudding' tastes this time around.""Zhengyu Huang, president of the Committee of 100, a nonprofit organization of prominent Chinese Americans, said that while nothing can be completed in one meeting, what can result is a better understanding of each country´s position on key issues and the search to find common ground.""The US and China both face transnational challenges such as food supply, energy security, climate change and global peace. The two countries must work to reduce mutual misunderstandings and strive toward tangible solutions that benefit the world,"" Huang said.Tom Watkins, president and chief executive officer of TDW and Associates, a US-based business and education consulting firm, said it is plausible that the two presidents are taking steps that raise hopes of propelling the world forward.""Leadership matters,"" Watkins said. ""Peace and prosperity over confrontation and conflict — this is what the people of China, the USA and all of humanity are looking for.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1116/c90000-10172018.html,16,11,2022,"['china', 'bilateral', 'meeting', 'relations', 'president', 'business', 'biden', 'washington', 'xi', 'leaders', 'forward', 'ties', 'global', 'wang', 'intentions', 'peace', 'relationship', 'issues', 'bali', 'indonesia']",0.34350446561985026,0.10425546675546676,16/11/2022
