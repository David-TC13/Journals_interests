The department has also sanctioned Spacety´s Luxembourg-based subsidiary. Under the sanctions, there can be no transfer, payment, or export of any property or interests in the United States to the targeted entities.Spacety China has yet to respond to the move.China, a strategic partner of Russia, has attempted to position itself as a neutral party with regard to the Ukraine war. It has been criticised by the US and its allies for refusing to condemn Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.WATCH: Inside the Wagner groupRussia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarOn its website, Spacety China describes itself as a ""pioneer"" in providing commercial SAR technology and says  it wants to ""make SAR imagery of every point on earth accessible and affordable"" to users all over the world.SAR is a type of radar technology that can deliver higher resolution images using shorter antennas.Its chief executive officer Yang Feng sits on China´s Ministry of Science and Technology´s panel of experts, according to the company´s website.The site also lists a number of working partners including state-owned enterprises China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, as well as the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.Image source, AFPImage caption, On its website, Spacety China describes itself as a ""pioneer"" in providing satellite technologyIn addition to Spacety China, 15 other entities, eight individuals and four aircraft - many of them based in Russia - that allegedly form part of Wagner´s global support network also received US sanctions.These include Sewa Security Services based in central Africa and Kratol Aviation based in the United Arab Emirates, which allegedly provided aircraft to move personnel and equipment between central Africa, Libya and Mali.Wagner now commands some 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, according to estimates from the White House. The organisation plays a key role in Russia´s war efforts, and has been heavily involved in attempts to capture Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine.It is led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""Today´s expanded sanctions on Wagner, as well as new sanctions on their associates and other companies enabling the Russian military complex, will further impede Putin´s ability to arm and equip his war machine,"" said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warChinaRussiaUkraineRussia sanctions",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64421915,27,1,2023,"['ukraine', 'wagner', 'russia', 'china', 'sanctions', 'spacety', 'technology', 'war', 'based', 'firm', 'sar', 'group', 'mercenary', 'fighters', 'allegedly', 'providing', 'satellite', 'science', 'entities', 'treasury']",0.2720170454545454,-0.01917613636363636,27/1/2023

However, there is no way of verifying how many soldiers were killed when US-made Himars missiles hit a vocational college packed with conscripts. Ammunition was also being stored close to the site, which was reduced to rubble. Whatever the number, this is the highest number of deaths acknowledged by Russia since it invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.Rallies were held in several cities in Russia´s south-western region of Samara, where governor Dmitry Azarov said many of the conscripts had lived.The biggest commemoration took place in the city of Samara itself, with at least 200 people taking part. Other official events were held in the industrial city of Tolyatti and in Syzran and Novokuybyshevsk.No criticism was reported at the Samara rally, where the main remarks came from Yekaterina Kolotovkina, who said ""neither we nor our husbands wanted war; the entire West united against us to eliminate us and our children"". Hers was very much an official voice as her husband, Lt Gen Andrei Kolotovkin, commands the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army based in Samara.The commander´s wife´s remarks prompted anger on social media with independent journalist Dmitry Kolezev pointing out that her husband did not die in Makiivka. ""Could we have at least some evidence?"" he asked, in response to her claim that the West intended to kill Samara´s children. Another blogger condemned her comments as a ""pack of lies"".The governor of Samara met defence ministry officials in Moscow on Tuesday and was expected to visit some of the wounded in hospital in the city of Rostov-on-Don the next day.President Vladimir Putin has so far said nothing about the attack, but did sign a decree on Tuesday for families of National Guard soldiers killed in service to be paid 5m roubles (£57,000; $69,000).Image source, ReutersImage caption, The building housing the conscripts was all but flattened in the Ukrainian attackThe soldiers sent to Makiivka were among an estimated 300,000 men signed up by Russia´s military as part of the president´s ""partial mobilisation"" announced last September in the face of a string of setbacks in Ukraine.A number of voices have been highly critical of the military in the aftermath of the attack on Makiivka, a city adjacent to the main city of Donetsk and some distance from the front line.Pavel Gubarev, a former leading official in Russia´s proxy authority in Donetsk, condemned the decision to place a large number of soldiers in one building as ""criminal negligence"". Such mistakes were being made early in the war, he complained, and even if the conscripts did not realise the risk, the authorities should have. ""If no-one is punished for this, then it´ll only get worse,"" he warned.One theory promoted by local security officials was that Ukrainian forces had been able to detect the use of Russian mobile phones by servicemen arriving at the vocational college on New Year´s Eve.The deputy speaker of Moscow´s local parliament, Andrei Medvedev, said it was predictable that the soldiers would be blamed - instead of the commander who made the original decision to position so many soldiers in one place.""History will certainly preserve the names of those who tried to keep silent about the trouble, and those who tried to blame the dead soldier for everything,"" he wrote on Telegram.Meanwhile, Ukraine´s armed forces said they killed or wounded 500 Russian troops in another attack on New Year´s Eve, on a village in the occupied southern region of Kherson. There was no independent verification of the attack at Chulakivka, some 20km south of the River Dnipro. Russian forces retreated across the Dnipro in November and Ukrainian officials have posted video of a flag being hoisted on an island between the eastern and western banks of the river.Ukraine´s southern military command has warned that it is too early to talk of Velykyi Potomkin island being completely liberated.Commander in chief Valerii Zaluzhny said on Monday that Ukraine had liberated 40% of the territories seized by Russia since last February, and 28% of all territories occupied by Russia since 2014.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64155859,3,1,2023,"['ukraine', 'russia', 'soldiers', 'makiivka', 'attack', 'military', 'samara', 'commander', 'killed', 'city', 'ukrainian', 'conscripts', 'number', 'local', 'wife', 'building', 'occupied', 'eve', 'west', 'wounded']",0.27064604377104384,0.008111471861471858,3/1/2023

When the Russian army loomed over Ukraine at the end of February 2022, two university students, Maxsym Lutsyk and Dmytro Kisilenko, decided that they could not sit idle when their country was threatened. Maxsym was 19, Dmytro was 18. I met them at a volunteer centre in central Kyiv on the day they signed up to fight. They took their big step into the unknown dressed to go to a festival, not to war. Dmytro had a yoga mat to sleep on. The older volunteers, saying goodbye to wives and children, could barely raise a smile. Young men, not long out of school, not needing to shave much, were laughing and joking, full of bravado. I suspected they didn´t feel as brave as they wanted to look. Twelve months later, I caught up with Dmytro and Maxsym in the cold winter sun back at the volunteer centre. ""Well, actually there was a lot of fear,"" Dmytro admitted. ""I´m not going to lie because I hadn´t experienced anything like that before. There were a lot of pessimistic news and we were preparing for the worst. And it was mostly like a mixture of bravery… and in our guts we felt that not everything will be all right.""Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym (left) and Dmytro (right) were students when they volunteered as recruits to fight for their countryMaxsym agreed, and many Ukrainians to whom I´ve spoken had the same sort of thoughts. ""A year ago, we had a lot of fear in our hearts and even in our brains. We understood that it will be pretty dangerous to became soldiers, to try to fight with guns. But we also had courage and we had some stupid bravery, and it helped us to overcome our fear.  ""We understood that it will be very bad for us to stay in some shelters, not act in the battle. And it will be bad for us if Russians would occupy Kyiv or other territories of Ukraine. They would kill us or put us in prison because of our political views.""They were not joining a winning army. The Americans and their allies were expecting a rapid Russian victory, followed by an insurgency that they were preparing to support. Their attitudes changed rapidly after Ukraine had shown how well it could fight with old Soviet-era weapons and a sprinkling of modern ones that Nato had supplied. Since then, Nato, led by the United States, has steadily broken its self-imposed limits on what it will supply. Main battle tanks are the latest upgrade. Ukraine wants modern warplanes next.

""The Russians have made their biggest mistake…  Everyone knows their enemy now. And not only it´s national unity, but it´s international unity… And it´s like someone told me two years ago that the United Kingdom, United States, all the European leaders will help us, and it´s the world, Ukraine will be spoken in every television news, I wouldn´t have imagined that."" The conflict forced the North Atlantic alliance to face up to the reality of a sharp and dangerous new division in Europe. The relationship with Moscow that had been under increasing strain for more than a decade snapped when President Putin ordered the invasion last February.With Ukraine, its people and Europe propelled into a new and dangerous era, the continent has come full circle from the hopeful years that followed the end of the Cold War. In 1989, six months before the Berlin Wall was toppled, the first President George Bush laid out the dream of a ""Europe whole and free"". It does not feel like that on the front lines in Donbas. But Kyiv today is a city transformed from the shuttered, apprehensive place it was in the first few weeks after the invasion. Snow swirled around the crowds that packed the platforms at the main railway station. Wind that felt as if it had come off the coldest part of the steppe cut into thousands of women and children, about to become refugees, who were pushing to get onto trains heading west, away from the Russians. Being there felt like watching a re-run of old newsreels from the 20th Century´s darkest times. Barriers were blocking roads, welders were making tank traps from steel girders, and thousands of bottles were being filled with petrol to make Molotov cocktails to throw at the Russian tanks everyone expected. At the moment, the capital has a veneer of normality. Shops are open, people with money can go to restaurants, and there is a rush hour. Of course, it is not normal, because the country is at war, and by mid-evening the streets are quiet. Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym Lutsyk (left) and Dmytro Kisilenko (right) believe Russia has made its biggest mistakeThe contrast between Kyiv and the battered front line towns in the war zones in the east and south is huge. Dmytro and Maxsym fought in the battle that forced a Russian retreat at the end of March. Since then, the pressure has mostly been off the capital, compared to the nightmarish months since the Russian focus turned to the Donbas and the approaches to the Crimean Peninsula in the south.  Maxsym and Dmytro are volunteers, and as students they are allowed to claim an exemption from compulsory military service. Under pressure from his family, Dmytro decided after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv to go back to university. Now he volunteers to help with supplies for Maxsym and his other former comrades. ""It was a really hard decision. But when all your battle buddies, or when all your comrades are going to the east, they continue, they are like away, and you just left this community, you feel a bit odd."" His decision does not seem to have affected their friendship. Maxsym stayed with their unit, and in the months since then has been in some of the heaviest fighting of the war, in the battles in Donbas. He looks noticeably older and is more assertive. I saw him in Bakhmut in the summer, as the Russians were starting to attack it. He had driven out of nearby Severodonetsk to get supplies for his unit. He went back that day, and not long before the town fell to the Russians, Maxsym was wounded.  Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, In May last year, three months after volunteering, Maxsym met the BBC in BakhmutIt was, he said, his worst moment of the war. His position was hit by a strike from Russian heavy artillery, a 203mm Pion. His commander, who received Ukraine´s highest award for valour, was killed. Maxsym was knocked cold and had severe concussion. The Ukrainian forces, outnumbered and outgunned, had to retreat across a river.  ""The Russians destroyed all the bridges, doing intelligence to find places where we are crossing the river and they shelled these places. So staying there for longer period of time was possible, but many guys died there. And if we stayed for a longer period, many more guys would have died in a few weeks.""Maxsym believes that Russian soldiers arrived in Ukraine a year ago swallowing Kremlin propaganda that they would be welcomed as liberators and protectors of Russian speakers. The last year of fighting, he says, on battlegrounds like Severodonetsk and Bakhmut, has wiped out any Russian illusions about what it would take to beat Ukraine. They understand, he said, that they don´t have friends waiting for them. ""They know that they will enter Bakhmut city only when they will destroy it, when they will kill every Ukrainian soldier who is defending it… They understand that they are fighting for territories and for some political reasons of their government.""Ukrainian soldiers who have served in the east do not have illusions either about an easy victory. The Russians have taken huge casualties. But they are still fighting, have capable electronic warfare and air defence systems and kill and wound many Ukrainians. The Kremlin´s appetite for a war of attrition has not slackened. Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian forces have spent months trying to capture the Ukrainian city of BakhmutDmytro and Maxsym see victory the same way as President Volodymyr Zelensky. Every piece of Ukraine needs to be recaptured. Nato has massively increased its support. But giving Ukraine decisive combat power carries too many risks, in American minds especially. A time may come when Ukraine´s allies push for negotiations.Dmytro was firm. ""Every inch of Ukrainian land which were recognized as Ukrainian in 1991 should be Ukrainian."" President Vladimir Putin believes Ukraine belongs to Russia. Ironically, the war he started is building the Ukrainian nation. ""We have a joke,"" Maxsym said. ""Putin will be made a hero of Ukraine for the job he´s done to unite Ukraine, to build our economy, to build our army, and to make the Ukrainian nation great.""Dmytro laughed. ""But yeah, the war is horrible, but it´s like the price for our unity and our country.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64733014,24,2,2023,"['ukraine', 'maxsym', 'war', 'dmytro', 'ukrainian', 'russians', 'months', 'jeremy', 'kyiv', 'russia', 'bowenimage', 'left', 'felt', 'fear', 'fight', 'cold', 'image', 'battle', 'president', 'fighting']",0.3953377986842554,0.022531785799502334,24/2/2023

A number of other cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa, were also hit.Much of Ukraine is now under an emergency blackout after missiles hit power infrastructure in several cities. Earlier, the UK said it would send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help the country´s defence.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Challengers, the British army´s main battle tank, would help Kyiv´s forces ""push Russian troops back"".Russia responded by saying that providing more weapons to Ukraine would lead to intensified Russian operations and more civilian casualties.Later on Saturday - a day when Ukrainians celebrate the Old (or Orthodox) New Year - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian attacks on civilian targets could be stopped only if Ukraine´s Western partners supplied necessary weapons.""What is needed for this? Those weapons which are in the depots of our partners and which our soldiers are waiting for so much,"" he said in his nightly video address, adding that his forces shot down more than 20 out of 30 Russian missiles fired at Ukraine. Image source, STR/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockImage caption, Rescue teams work in the rubble of the damaged residential building hit by shelling in DniproThe devastating strike in Dnipro hit the entrance of a nine-storey building, turning several floors into smouldering rubble, and leaving 73 injured, including 14 children, Ukrainian officials said, in what is likely to be the worst attack in months.A sizeable crowd gathered to watch the rescue effort at the site of the strike, while others joined rescue workers in a desperate search for survivors. There were urgent calls, human chains of volunteers clearing rubble and torch beams piercing thick clouds of dust and smoke.  In his address, Mr Zelensky said debris clearance in Dnipro would continue all night: ""We are fighting for every person, every life."" So far, 38 people have been rescued from the building, including six children, officials say.There is no information yet on why the apartment block was the object of such devastation, as it is some distance from the nearest power facility. On a day when Russia seemed intent, once again, on targeting Ukraine´s energy grid, this could have been one of the less accurate missiles in Russia´s arsenal, or something brought down by Ukraine´s air defences - although on the face of it, this seems a less likely explanation. It has been two weeks since the last wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine´s power grid. Mr Zelensky said of the energy infrastructure facilities hit on Saturday that the most difficult situation was in the Kharkiv and Kyiv regions.Ukrainian state energy company Ukrenergo earlier said round-the-clock consumption limits had been set for all regions until midnight local time.Officials, in the West and in Ukraine, had begun to wonder if Russia´s ""energy war"" might be coming to an end, due to a possible shortage of suitable missiles and the evident fact the strategy has yet to break Ukraine´s spirit. Saturday´s attacks suggest Moscow still thinks it is a tactic worth pursuing.

President Vladimir Putin announced the move on Tuesday in his annual address to the nation.The deal, signed in 2010, limits the number of US and Russian nuclear warheads and gives each the power to inspect the other´s weapons. Mr Biden´s comments came as he met a key group of Nato allies in Poland. The group of eastern European states, known as the Bucharest Nine, reiterated their condemnation of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine nearly a year since its start. Putin´s decision to suspend involvement in the nuclear treaty was officially pushed through by both houses of Russia´s parliament on Wednesday.But Russia´s foreign ministry later said Moscow would continue to comply with the New Start treaty´s restrictions in a ""responsible approach"".A senior military official told Russia´s lower house that the country would continue to observe agreed restrictions on nuclear delivery systems - meaning missiles and strategic bomber planes.What is the New Start treaty?Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.Each side´s limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world´s nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.Speaking ahead of the meeting with leaders from the Bucharest Nine nations - which make up Nato´s eastern flank - Mr Biden said suspending New Start was a ""big mistake"" and reiterated the US commitment to the military alliance.""Article 5 is a sacred commitment the United States has made. We will defend literally every inch of Nato,"" he said. Article 5 stipulates that an attack on any member state is treated as an attack on all and requires a joint response.At the meeting he told the assembled leaders that they were the ""front line of our collective defence"". In a joint statement after the meeting the group said they were committed to increasing Nato´s military presence on their territories.Russia says Nato - which could soon see Sweden and Finland become new members - represents an existential threat.Mr Putin, speaking at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of the war, said Russia was fighting in Ukraine for its ""historical"" lands.""I just heard from the top military leadership of the country that a battle is ongoing right now, for our historical lands, for our people,"" he said.Earlier he met China´s top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow and said cooperation with Beijing was ""very important to stabilise the international situation"". Mr Wang said Beijing was ready to strengthen its partnership with Moscow and said their relationship would not be affected by pressure from other countries.China´s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visitWagner chief blames deaths on lack of ammunitionHow Russia´s 35-mile armoured convoy ended in failureRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinNuclear weaponsJoe Biden",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64735708,22,2,2023,"['russia', 'nuclear', 'treaty', 'war', 'biden', 'start', 'ukraine', 'nato', 'big', 'mistake', 'suspend', 'moscow', 'military', 'arms', 'met', 'leaders', 'bucharest', 'putin', 'number', 'warheads']",0.29560915275200983,0.04401607915893631,22/2/2023

Russia is usually represented at the event, as the camp in occupied Poland was liberated by the Soviet Army.But this year, following Moscow´s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum declined to invite Russian officials and its director likened the Ukraine war to the horrors of the Holocaust.In response, Russia accused the museum of attempting to ""rewrite history"". At the event on Friday, museum director Piotr Cywinski said Auschwitz was created by Nazi ""megalomania"" and a ""similar sick megalomania"" and ""similar lust for power"" had driven Russia´s destruction of Mariupol and Donetsk. Speaking to an audience including camp survivors, he warned that ""once again, innocent people are being killed en masse in Europe"".""Russia, unable to conquer Ukraine, has decided to destroy it. We see it every day, even as we stand here. And so it is difficult to stand here today.""Reacting to the decision, Russia said Soviet soldiers who freed Auschwitz would not be forgotten. ""No matter how our European ´non-partners´ contrived in their attempts to rewrite history in a new way, the memory of the Soviet heroes-liberators and horrors of Nazism cannot be erased,"" Russia´s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in a pointed social media post.Auschwitz survivors also expressed their fears over the fallout of the war in Ukraine at the event.Polish survivor Zdzislawa Wlodarczyk said she was ""scared to hear what is happening in the East"".She told the audience that she had arrived in Auschwitz as an 11-year-old following the Warsaw Uprising, a failed attempt by the Polish resistance in 1944 to liberate the city from the German occupiers.She and her 7-year-old brother remained in the camp until the Soviet army liberated it.""The Russian armies that liberated us are now waging war on Ukraine. Why? Why? That´s what politics is,"" she said.The Polish nation has stood firm in its support for Ukraine during the conflict, with Poles housing hundreds of thousands of refugees in their own homes and offering military support to its neighbour.Russian officials have taken part in their own commemorative events, with Vladimir Putin meeting Russia´s top rabbis on the eve of the remembrance day on Thursday.The Russian leader said he was ""pursuing a policy meaning nothing like this in the history of mankind will ever happen again"".Russia´s Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar has spoken about his regret that Russia has been excluded from the commemoration, warning that ""these political games have no place on Holocaust day"".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar attends a candle lighting ceremony at the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Centre in MoscowHe told AFP: ""For us, this is clearly a humiliation because we perfectly know and remember the role of the Red [Soviet] Army in the liberation of Auschwitz and in the victory over Nazism.""Friday´s event marks the 78th anniversary of the Soviet army liberating the concentration and extermination camp in German-occupied Poland, where more than one million people were murdered by the Nazis. Auschwitz-Birkenau was created as a part of the Holocaust, a process that started with discrimination against Jewish people, and ended with six million Jews being killed because of who they were.In total, 1.1 million people died in the camp, around one million Jews from across Europe as well as Poles, Soviet POWs, Roma and Sinti.

India, which hosted this week´s G20 talks in the southern city of Bengaluru, issued a wide-ranging ""chair´s summary"" from the meeting, noting there were ""different assessments of the situation"" in Ukraine, and on sanctions imposed on Russia.A footnote said that two paragraphs summarising the war were ""agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China"". The paragraphs were adapted from the G20 Bali Leaders´ Declaration in November, and criticised ""in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine"".After taking a back seat since the invasion a year ago, Beijing has stepped up its diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in recent weeks. Its top diplomat Wang Yi toured Europe this week, culminating in a warm welcome by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.China also this week published a 12-point plan for ending the war in Ukraine, in which it called for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty. However, the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and did not condemn Russia´s invasion.The Chinese document was welcomed by Russia, prompting US President Joe Biden to comment: ""[President] Putin´s applauding it, so how could it be any good?""Zelensky wants to meet China´s Xi to discuss peace planWhy China launched a charm offensiveAfter the G20 meeting, Ajay Seth, a senior Indian official, said in a press conference that Russian and Chinese representatives did not agree to the wording on Ukraine because ""their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues"". ""On the other hand, all the other 18 countries felt that the war has got implications for the global economy"" and needed to be mentioned, he added. The 17-paragraph summary of the summit also referenced the recent earthquake in Turkey, debt in low- and middle-income countries, global tax policy, and food insecurity.Russia´s foreign ministry said it regretted the fact that ""the activities of the G20 continue to be destabilised by the Western collective and used in an anti-Russian... way"". It accused the United States, European Union and G7 nations of ""clear blackmail"", urging them to ""acknowledge the objective realities of a multipolar world"". But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: ""This is a war. And this war has a cause, has one cause, and that is Russia and Vladimir Putin. That must be expressed clearly at this G20 finance meeting."" Previous meetings of G20 members have also failed to produce a joint statement since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. On Thursday, the UN General Assembly in New York overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warChinaRussiaIndiaG20",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64773618,25,2,2023,"['russia', 'ukraine', 'china', 'invasion', 'war', 'condemn', 'countries', 'week', 'statement', 'meeting', 'president', 'putin', 'refuses', 'failed', 'agree', 'summit', 'india', 'beijing', 'aggression', 'strongest']",0.22896270396270396,0.060120435120435134,25/2/2023

Made up of several social media groups on different platforms, it was created in 2021 but fully launched in February 2022 - just days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The network swiftly gained over 80,000 followers.Image caption, A typical post on RussosphèreAfter the invasion, Russian state media was restricted or banned from all mainstream social platforms. Russosphère was not, and quickly became active on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter in addition to Telegram and VK - Russia´s homegrown version of Facebook.The discovery comes at a time of a swift deterioration in relationships between France and several African nations that analysts partly attribute to the Kremlin´s influence and a growing pro-Russian sentiment fuelled by propaganda.Kyle Walter is head of US investigations at Logically. Using data from their internal artificial intelligence-powered platform combined with open source intelligence, Logically tracked the network back to a man called Luc Michel.In the past, Mr Michel has worked to legitimise votes in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, and been linked to ""Merci [thank you] Wagner"", a group supporting the work of the Russian mercenaries.We contacted Mr Michel and he agreed to discuss Russosphère. He told us he created it, but said it received no financial support from Russia, saying it is funded by ""private money"".He also insisted that he had no connections with Wagner and its head Yevgeny Prigozhin. ""I manage the cyberwar, the media war… and Prigozhin conducts military activities,"" he said.Image source, Luc Michel´s websiteImage caption, Luc Michel is little known in Europe, but promotes himself in AfricaAccording to Mr Walter, a co-author of Logically´s report, this campaign is the first time Mr Michel´s efforts have had real-world impact. ""Russosphère is the first time Luc Michel and the general influence operations he runs have had significant success,"" he says.""Even if the groups have been helped by bots in the beginning, they are now an authentic organic influence operation, with a large portion of real followers from across Africa.""Admirer of Gaddafi and PutinMr Michel´s early history may seem unusual for a self-proclaimed friend of Africa.Born in 1958, he was politically active from a young age, first in the neo-fascist groups of his native Belgium, and later as a follower of Jean Thiriart, a former Nazi collaborator who envisioned a ""Euro-Soviet empire from Vladivostok to Dublin"", united against America.His career took him to Libya in support of the country´s leader at the time, Muammar Gaddafi. He also went to Burundi as an advisor to then-President Pierre Nkurunziza.Image caption, Mr Michel interviewing the CAR President TouadéraThroughout, he maintained a Russian connection, working with ""Nashi"", the Kremlin´s youth movement, and creating a self-styled ""election-monitoring group"" that declared Moscow´s 2014 illegal referendums in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk ""free and fair"". ""I am a Stalinist,"" he told the BBC. ""I have defended Russia since the 1980s. I think that Russia is the only force left in Europe that is anti-American. I am nostalgic of the Soviet Union. I want a free world without America.""From social media to the streetsIt is difficult to assess the impact of specific disinformation campaigns, but in Africa the pro-Russian message is being heard - amplified, say analysts, by local influencers cultivated by Russia.""The success of people like Luc Michel is because of his opposition to France. It taps into real grievances on the ground,"" says Kevin Limonier, an associate professor at the University of Paris-8 studying Moscow´s information operations in Africa.""Russian misinformation was a factor helping to drive the French forces out of Sahel countries, especially Burkina Faso,"" according to Ulf Laessing, from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a centre-right German think tank.From 2013, some 5,000 French troops had been deployed to fight militant jihadist groups in Mali as well as in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger and Mauritania. But last year, they pulled out of Mali and are preparing to leave Burkina Faso.Image source, AFPImage caption, A Russian flag at a protest in Chad in October 2022They have been under pressure from the military governments in the two countries but Beverly Ochieng from BBC Monitoring agrees that popular sentiment may have had something to do with it.""Russian flags were waved at protests in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, and that is in part due to pro-Russian info-ops,"" she says.In Burkina Faso, protesters attacked the French embassy and were heard demanding closer ties between Ouagadougou and Moscow.This chimes directly with Mr Michel´s aims. ""I think that Russia must replace the French in all of Africa,"" he told the BBC.""Estimating the impact of information operations is almost impossible,"" says Mr Limonier, expert in the Kremlin´s influence campaigns. But one thing is clear: such operations worry the West.In Paris, according to Mr Limonier, ""the diplomats and the military, they read it, they see it and they say: ´Oh my gosh´.""Related TopicsCentral African RepublicRussiaBurundiBurkina FasoPropagandaDisinformationMali",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64451376,1,2,2023,"['russia', 'michel', 'africa', 'operations', 'disinformation', 'network', 'influence', 'russosph', 'luc', 'burkina', 'faso', 'wagner', 'social', 'pro', 'kremlin', 'france', 'logically', 'groups', 'image', 'french']",0.312938353636028,0.037040882244370625,1/2/2023

In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said Estonia had ""purposefully destroyed"" relations with Moscow. Margus Laidre is the first ambassador Russia has expelled since invading Ukraine last year. Estonia responded by asking the Russian ambassador to leave by the same date. Russia´s move against Mr Laidre comes after Estonia recently ordered a reduction in the size of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn.Moscow was told to reduce its embassy from 17 to eight by the end of January. In a statement in January, Estonia said embassy staff had stopped seeking to advance relations between the countries since the conflict broke out. Tensions were also raised last week after representatives from 11 Nato nations gathered at an army base in Estonia to discuss a range of new packages to help Ukraine recapture territory and fend off any further Russian advances. Latvia´s foreign ministry has also asked the Russian ambassador to leave by 24 February and said the country would support Estonia by reducing diplomatic relations with Russia.Mr Laidre has been appointed to the Russian Federation since 2018 and has previously held the role in the UK and Finland. He was working from the Estonian Embassy in Moscow, and will now be replaced with a chargé d´affaires - a diplomat of a lower rank acting in place of an ambassador. The statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: ""In recent years, the Estonian leadership has purposefully destroyed the entire range of relations with Russia. Total Russophobia, the cultivation of hostility towards our country has been elevated by Tallinn to the rank of state policy.""Now Estonia has taken a new unfriendly step to radically reduce the number of personnel of the Russian embassy in Tallinn, confirming the line towards the collapse of relations between our countries. As a response, the Russian side decided to downgrade the diplomatic representative in both countries to chargé d´affaires.""The press release added that Mr Laidre was summoned to the ministry on Monday where he was asked to leave the country. The statement ended by stating that the development of the two countries´ relationship now lies with Estonia.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaEstonia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64372508,23,1,2023,"['estonia', 'russia', 'ambassador', 'leave', 'country', 'estonian', 'laidre', 'relations', 'embassy', 'ukraine', 'statement', 'ministry', 'countries', 'foreign', 'moscow', 'tallinn', 'orders', 'margus', 'representative', 'previously']",0.25462382445141063,-0.08915882967607106,23/1/2023

The authoritarian leader of Belarus is a firm Kremlin ally and backer of what Mr Putin refers to as the ""special military operation"" - what most of the world calls Russia´s war in Ukraine.Since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago, Mr Putin hasn´t sat down with Western journalists. But today in Minsk, Mr Lukashenko took questions from a small group of foreign media, including the BBC.""Last year you allowed your country to be used as a staging ground for Russia´s invasion,"" I reminded Mr Lukashenko. ""Are you prepared to do so again?"" ""Yes, I´m ready,"" he replied. ""I´m ready to provide [territory] again. I´m also ready to wage war, alongside the Russians, from the territory of Belarus. But only if someone - even a single soldier - enters our territory from there (Ukraine) with weapons to kill my people.""Military co-operation between Russia and Belarus has been on the increase, with joint drills and the formation of a joint military grouping. But so far the Belarusian leader has avoided sending his troops into Ukraine to fight alongside Russian forces.The UK, EU and the United States do not recognise Alexander Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus. In 2020 Belarusians poured on to the streets to accuse him of stealing the country´s presidential election. The protests were brutally suppressed.Mr Lukashenko used Thursday´s event to blame the West for the war in Ukraine. He accused Western governments of fuelling the conflict and engaged in a touch of Putinesque nuclear sabre-rattling,""If you continue this escalation, you will get nuclear weapons and Russia has more than anyone,"" he said.""So, you should stop this. If a nuclear war starts, Belarus will cease to exist. We need to sit down at the negotiating table, because nuclear war will wipe out the USA too. No-one needs this.""Image source, ReutersImage caption, Belarus shares a border with Ukraine and Russia sent troops from there when it launched its invasionHaving facilitated the Russian invasion of Ukraine one year ago, the Belarusian leader now claims he can help negotiate peace. Mr Lukashenko suggested that next week would be a good time to start, with US President Joe Biden due to visit Poland.""I invite [President Biden] to Belarus,"" Mr Lukashenko said. ""It´s not far from Warsaw, Thirty minutes and he´ll be in Minsk. He could land his plane here. I will persuade the president of Russia to come. I invite him too to Minsk, as well as Biden. We will sit down and reach an agreement."" It is an invitation the US president is likely to decline.

When will the contracts be signed?""The government´s first meeting came on the same day that President Putin replaced his top commander in Ukraine after just three months in charge.Gen Sergei Surovikin was appointed in October after a series of setbacks in Russia´s invasion of Ukraine but he has failed to reverse the course of the war. In an otherwise upbeat video call shown on Russian TV in which President Putin praised his ministers´ handling of the economy, President Putin repeatedly interrupted Mr Manturov, as the minister detailed plans for planes, helicopters and boats. ""These 700 aircraft, including helicopters... you need to sort this out with the defence ministry... several enterprises still haven´t received any orders,"" he complained.Russia replaces commander of Ukraine invasion forceMr Manturov has been a loyal member of the Putin ministerial team since 2012, and has regularly travelled with the president on foreign and domestic visits. He was handed the task of overseeing Russia´s weapons industry last summer when shortcomings had already been exposed on the battlefield.As he explained that his ministry had launched a programme to produce helicopter engines in St Petersburg that were previously made in Ukraine, the president butted in, complaining it was all taking too long.As the minister´s public humiliation neared its end, he promised his department would do its best with its economic partners. But this was clearly not enough for an increasingly agitated president.""No, do it within a month. Don´t you understand the situation we´re in? It needs to be done in a month, no later.""The televised dressing-down echoed an even more dramatic event three days before the war broke out, when Mr Putin ordered his top security figures to say whether Russia should recognise two occupied areas of eastern Ukraine as independent.When one of his closest allies, foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin, hesitantly suggested Russia´s Western partners should be given one last chance, President Putin began to interrogate him.Mr Naryshkin stumbled over his words several times before declaring he would support the two occupied regions being brought into the Russian Federation. Although President Putin said incorporating Ukraine´s regions into Russia was not on the table, several months later that was exactly what he announced.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64246902,12,1,2023,"['putin', 'president', 'ukraine', 'russia', 'manturov', 'minister', 'fooling', 'long', 'top', 'lays', 'denis', 'member', 'vladimir', 'ministerial', 'team', 'government', 'meeting', 'industry', 'planes', 'taking']",0.2381410256410256,0.08293650793650793,12/1/2023

""RF [Russia] wants to scare its people to justify the attack on another country,"" he said. Russia has previously reported some Ukrainian missile and drone strikes on Russian border areas, including Bryansk region. But there have been no confirmed reports of Ukrainian ground forces infiltrating Russia.Russia´s Federal Security Service (FSB) said FSB forces and regular troops on Thursday clashed with ""Ukrainian nationalists"" who had crossed into Russia and taken hostages. The FSB said the ""nationalists"" were then hit with a massive Russian artillery strike and pushed back into Ukraine. They left a large cache of explosives in the village, the FSB alleged.When Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 President Putin branded the Kyiv government ""nationalists"" and ""neo-Nazis"", arguing that Russia had to act against them.President Zelensky was democratically elected, has Jewish origins and has no far-right politicians in his government. Speaking on Russian state TV on Thursday President Putin said ""today they committed another terrorist act, another crime, penetrated the border area and opened fire on civilians"".""They saw that it was a civilian car, that civilians and children were sitting there, and opened fire. It is exactly such people who set themselves the task of depriving us of historical memory. They will achieve nothing, we will put the squeeze on them,"" he said.A video has appeared online claiming to show members of the Ukraine-based Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) outside a local clinic. One armed man in the video, posted on Telegram, says they crossed into Russia. The investigative journalism group Bellingcat Monitoring describes the RVC as ""a unit officially formed last year made up primarily of anti-Putin, anti-Kremlin Russian far-right figures active in Ukraine"".A Bellingcat expert, Michael Colborne, has identified one of the men in the video as RVC leader Denis Kapustin, who also uses the surname Nikitin. ""This RVC seems to do very little actual fighting, or at least serious fighting, and Kapustin may have physical combat sports training but he is not from any sort of military background,"" Mr Colborne told the BBC. In a text post with the video the RVC said it ""entered Bryansk region to show our compatriots that there is hope, that free Russians carrying arms can fight the regime"".Commenting on the RVC claim, a Ukrainian military intelligence official, Andriy Yusov, said ""these are people who are fighting with arms against the Putin regime and those who support him... Perhaps Russians are beginning to wake up, realise something and take some concrete steps"".This week Mr Putin accused Ukraine and Western spies of intensifying operations inside Russia. Russian officials said a drone crashed in the Kolomna district just 100km (62 miles) from Moscow - though it was not confirmed to be Ukrainian - while two Ukrainian drones were allegedly shot down in southern Russia. Previously Russia said drones had attacked an airbase in southern Russia used for launching bomber strikes on Ukraine. Kyiv has not claimed drone attacks inside Russia, accusing the Kremlin of propaganda.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64826028,2,3,2023,"['russia', 'ukraine', 'putin', 'ukrainian', 'border', 'rvc', 'act', 'president', 'terrorist', 'region', 'fsb', 'village', 'thursday', 'opened', 'fire', 'civilians', 'bryansk', 'kyiv', 'drone', 'nationalists']",0.22671537399798272,-0.0072830400276052455,2/3/2023

It is bordered by the Moskva river and the Kremlin on one side, and on the other by imposing Stalinist apartment buildings and 21st Century skyscrapers on the noisy Sadovoye ring road. A maze of narrow streets echo the past, dotted with churches and aristocratic mansions from the 19th Century. Bolshaya Ordinka street takes its name from Tatar-Mongol rule, hundreds of years before, when emissaries would come to collect tributes from Moscow´s princely leaders.I was there last February when I was phoned by a friend, born in Ukraine´s second-biggest city Kharkiv, who now worked in Moscow.""Was Putin really going to start a war with Ukraine?"" he asked. Neither of us wanted to believe it.But surrounded by reminders of Russia´s often relentlessly violent past I felt war was now inevitable. My daily walks were my way of saying goodbye to a world, and perhaps even a country, that could never be the same again.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Russians have left their country in droves - many when Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation last SeptemberHundreds of thousands of Russians have left Russia, including me and my BBC Russian colleagues. But for the majority who have stayed in Russia, life outwardly is pretty much the same as it always was. Especially in the big cities.In Zamoskvorechiye, most of the shops, cafes, the businesses and the banks are still open. Many of the hipster journalists and IT specialists may have left but others have replaced them.Shoppers complain about rising prices, but local alternatives have replaced some imported goods. Image caption, You can still meet for coffee and the logo looks similar, but the Starbucks chain is long goneBookshops still have a wide variety of titles, although books deemed inappropriate are sold in plastic covers.The popular car-sharing service still works, but the cars are now largely Chinese-made.International sanctions have not brought Russia to the brink of 1990s-style economic collapse. But, as Belfast-based Russian academic Aleksandr Titov has observed, Russia is nonetheless living through a crisis. It is a slow-burning crisis, but look closely and there are signs of it everywhere.In Belgorod, close to the Ukrainian border and just 80km (50 miles) from the now war-torn city of Kharkiv, local people are now used to convoys of military trucks roaring towards the front line. If they are troubled by Russia bombing a city where many have friends and relatives, then they´re trying not to show it.Image source, SERGEY BOBOK/AFPImage caption, Most Russians either do not know or do not want to know what their military has done to Ukraine´s second biggest city KharkivCheery street festivals organised by the local governor are well attended, a friend tells me.But local doctors are leaving their jobs in droves, unable to cope with the numbers of war-wounded being brought for treatment in local hospitals.The shelled Russian border town backing Putin´s warResidents feel abandoned and angry in the little frontier town of Shebekino, where cross-border shelling has become a daily reality. One local family visiting St Petersburg were shocked to find nothing had changed while their own lives had been turned upside down. In Pskov, near the Estonian and Latvian borders, the atmosphere is gloomy and everyone pretends the war has nothing to do with them, I am told.Pskov is home to the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, now notorious for the war crimes its troops are accused of carrying out in Bucha, outside Kyiv.A bus service has started up connecting the city to the local cemetery where growing numbers of soldiers killed in Ukraine are being buried. Under a bridge someone has daubed PEACE in big red letters. Image caption, When the BBC visited this cemetery near Pskov there were dozens of fresh graves for Russian paratroopersOn a train heading for Petrozavodsk, near the Finnish border, a friend meets a group of teenagers playing a ""Name that city"" game.  Someone mentions Donetsk: Is it in Russia or Ukraine? None of them are sure. It has been occupied and annexed illegally by their government.How war is seen in rural RussiaHas Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checkedWhat do they think about the war? It´s nothing to do with them. Petrozavodsk appears to have returned to its grim past. Empty shelves, no foreign brands, unaffordably high prices.Do Russians really support the brutality being carried out in Ukraine in their name, or are they pretending it´s not happening to survive? From fleeting impressions and conversations it is hard to draw firm conclusions. Sociologists and pollsters have tried to gauge opinion, but there is no freedom of speech or information in Russia so it is impossible to tell if people are being honest.Polls suggest the majority of Russians, if not supporting the war, certainly do not oppose it. This has prompted angry debates among Russians abroad. Many who study and report on Russia, me included, believe a small percentage of people actively support the war, and a small percentage actively oppose it. Most ordinary Russians are in the middle, trying to make sense of a situation they didn´t choose, don´t understand and feel powerless to change. Could they have stopped it? Probably yes, if more people had stood up for their freedom and challenged state TV propaganda about trumped up threats from the West and Ukraine. Many Russians chose to stay away from politics and let the Kremlin decide for them. But keeping your head down means making very troubling moral compromises.To keep the war from their door, Russians have to pretend this isn´t an expansionist invasion, and must close their eyes to the Ukrainians who are killed and wounded in their tens of thousands and driven from their homes in their millions by what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"".  Image source, MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/Sputnik/AFP Image caption, Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a Putin ally, has blessed Russia´s war effortRussians must accept it´s normal for soldiers to go into schools and tell their children war is a good thing.That it´s normal for priests to support the war and stop praying for peace.That it doesn´t matter they can no longer travel or be part of a broader world.That the Kremlin was right to block the majority of independent media sites they used to read.That a sledgehammer is now a positive symbol of Russian power in executions captured on camera and posted by MPs on Twitter.And that it´s normal to go to jail for years for saying what you think about the war, whether you´re a councillor or a journalist.Why Russians do not protest is perhaps better explained by Russian history and not opinion polls.  Ever since he came to power, President Vladimir Putin has made it no secret that he wants to rebuild Russia and restore its position for the world to respect and reckon with.In speeches and essays he has made clear his belief that Russia occupies a unique place in the world as part of both the East and West. Russia has its own traditions, religion, and its own ways of doing things. Russians need order and control, and demand respect.Image source, YURI KADOBNOV/AFPImage caption, Vladimir Putin always blames the West for the war and state TV repeats his world viewThis message has echoed down the centuries and brooks no dissent or prospect for change. It´s a chokehold - to use a judo term from his favourite sport.This Putin vision comes with a price: Russians have paid with their freedom; Ukrainians are paying with their lives.Russia has opened up at times after moments of calamity and catastrophe. After defeat in Afghanistan in 1989 came the Gorbachev era. Defeat against Japan in 1905 was followed by constitutional reform, and after defeat in the Crimean war in 1856 came emancipation of the serfs.One pattern identified by pollsters is that most Russians say they would support peace talks to end the fighting. But what kind of guarantees they would give independent Ukraine is not yet clear. Sooner or later, that will need to be answered and Russians will have to confront what their country has done.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaMoscowVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64703768,22,2,2023,"['war', 'russians', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'putin', 'city', 'image', 'local', 'part', 'past', 'kremlin', 'border', 'support', 'afpimage', 'moscow', 'years', 'lives', 'friend', 'country', 'left']",0.37909181096681094,0.022026515151515148,22/2/2023

It is the latest in a series of closures targeting rights and opposition groups across Russia. The ruling comes after the justice ministry filed a lawsuit seeking to liquidate the group in December, arguing that it was only registered to defend human rights in Moscow - not other parts of the country.That´s despite the MHG having always worked with a wider scope.The group called the measure ""disproportionate"" at the time and said it would continue to function ""regardless of the wishes of the authorities"". In a statement on Wednesday, MHG reported that its co-chair told the judge and justice ministry representatives that they were ""committing a great sin"" by closing it down. ""You are destroying the human rights movement, you are destroying it,"" said Valery Borshov. ""The liquidation of the group is a serious blow to the human rights movement not only in Russia but also the world.""The lawsuit was based on the justice ministry´s ad hoc inspections of the MHG, which the group argued were illegal. It has said it will appeal the decision.It´s not the first time MHG has been forced to cease its operations. It lasted only months after its launch in the 1970s before the government jailed or forced practically all its members into exile. It was set up by a group of well known Soviet dissidents and named after the Helsinki accords, a wide-ranging international agreement signed by the USSR, which defended human rights and fundamental freedoms. The group was revived in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. MHG has likened its treatment by the Russian authorities to that suffered by Memorial, another prominent human rights group, which was shut down in 2021.Last year, Moscow courts liquidated several other rights groups, including the Journalists and Media Workers´ Union.International human rights organisations have heavily criticised the Russian government for what they claim is a nationwide crackdown on independent journalism and dissenting voices that has intensified since its invasion of Ukraine. That includes top opposition figures, the majority of whom are now either in prison or exiled. US-based charity the Human Rights Foundation has condemned Russia´s decision to shut down MHG. ""This is yet another example of the Kremlin´s campaign to silence opposition against the war in Ukraine,"" it tweeted.The Vice President of the European Commission, the European Union´s executive arm, has echoed these sentiments.  ""The Kremlin is extending its aggression in Ukraine into political repression at home, silencing human rights defenders, suppressing civil society and voices rejecting authoritarianism and war,"" said Josep Borrell on Twitter.

Balloons with reflectors have also been spotted over the eastern region of Dnipropetrovsk in recent days.""These objects could carry radar reflectors and certain reconnaissance equipment,"" said air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat. ""The balloons were launched to detect and exhaust our air defence forces."" High-altitude balloons have raised tensions in the US recently as well as in Ukraine. And earlier this week, Romania scrambled fighter jets when an object resembling a weather balloon was spotted at a height of around 11,000 ft (3,350m). Moldova briefly closed its air space because of the unidentified object.As the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches, the balloons appear to be an addition to Russia´s aerial use of cruise missiles and cheaper Iranian drones.The balloons have the potential to confuse radar systems and entice the Ukrainian military into launching very expensive surface-to air-missiles (Sams) at so-called ""false targets"".Given the balloons´ size and speed, the air force spokesman argued that Ukrainian radar was able to identify the objects correctly and on at least two occasions bring them down with bullets instead of wasting missiles.But the balloons could also act as decoys. Ukraine constantly scans the skies for Russian aircraft and missiles using ground-based radars, many of which are part of their own Soviet-era Sam systems along with modern equivalents supplied by the West.The Ukrainian military said the balloons had reflectors, which would entice Ukrainian aircraft defences to lock on to them.Image source, Ukrainian militaryImage caption, The Ukrainian military posted an image of the type of reflector used with the balloonsBy ""soaking up"" as much of that missile defence as possible, the balloons would then allow Russia´s fighters, bombers, cruise missiles and attack drones to strike Ukrainian targets relatively unimpeded.The principle is to reflect radar energy back from those Ukrainian radars which ""paint"" the balloons. The balloons, floating in high winds at altitude, might appear to be real Russian aircraft or helicopters, coaxing Ukrainian defences to engage them.Russian military expert Andrei Klintsevich said Russia was using the same strategy to protect the bridge over the Kerch strait to Crimea from attack.More sophisticated decoys have been used in past conflicts to confuse air defences. Israel is reported to have used them against Syrian Sams in the Bekaa Valley in 1982 and US aircraft in the opening hours of Operation Desert Storm, in Iraq, in 1991.  Modern Sam systems sent to Ukraine - such as Nasams, Iris-T and Patriot - may well be able to discriminate these balloon drones from real threats. But any distraction will be seen as a worthwhile tactic from the Russian perspective.The Ukrainian air force spokesman also made the point that the balloons might be engaged in surveillance and would need thorough investigation.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64661145,16,2,2023,"['balloons', 'ukrainian', 'ukraine', 'missiles', 'air', 'radar', 'kyiv', 'military', 'balloon', 'russia', 'aircraft', 'cruise', 'spotted', 'reflectors', 'force', 'spokesman', 'drones', 'systems', 'defences', 'wave']",0.33466594516594517,0.04505137085137084,16/2/2023

The state-run gas monopoly Gazprom still supplies a large share of Europe´s needs.Vladimir Putin - Russia´s dominant political figure since 2000 - has enhanced his control over state institutions and the media - a process supplemented more recently by an emphasis on fierce nationalism and hostility to the West.This led to his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in an attempt to re-assert Russian control over the neighbouring country. This was the largest conventional war in Europe since World War Two and has been met with widespread international condemnation.Read more country profiles - Profiles by BBC MonitoringRUSSIAN FEDERATION: FACTSCapital: MoscowArea: 17,098,246 sq kmPopulation: 147.1 millionLanguages: Russian, plus regional and local languagesLife expectancy: 66 years (men) 76 years (women)LEADERPresident: Vladimir PutinImage source, Getty ImagesVladimir Putin has been Russia´s dominant political figure since his election as president in 2000, serving two terms and then a four-year stint as prime minister, before resuming the presidency in 2012 and winning re-election in 2018.Since his re-election against only token opposition, Russia´s authorities have further tightened control over the media, thereby muffling an embryonic opposition movement. He has also and adopted a stridently nationalist course and appealed to memories of Soviet-era power to shore up domestic support.The president presents himself as a strong leader who took Russia out of the economic, social and political crisis of the 1990s, and defends Russia´s national interests, particularly against alleged Western hostility. Opponents and critics at home and abroad accuse him of undermining Russia´s institutions, halting democratic development, and entrenching rule by a narrow, wealthy elite.MEDIAImage source, Getty ImagesSince the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 nearly all independent media outlets in Russia have shut down, been forced to close, or have left the country to operate from exile. Top state-controlled domestic TV channels have cleared their schedules for current affairs programmes spreading anti-Ukrainian, anti-Western material.The authorities have also extended their control over the online world and are keen to curb the influence of global internet giants.Read full media profileTIMELINEImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Soldiers line up for a parade on Moscow´s Red SquareSome key dates in Russia´s history:1547 - Grand Prince Ivan IV of Moscow (Ivan the Terrible) is the first ruler to be proclaimed Tsar of Russia. 1689-1725 - Peter the Great introduces far-reaching reforms. 1798-1815 - Russia takes part in the European coalitions against Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, defeating Napoleon´s invasion in 1812 and contributing to his overthrow.1853-57 - Russia suffers setback in attempt to seize territory from declining Ottoman Empire through its defeat in Crimean War.1904-05 - Russian expansion in Manchuria leads to war with Japan - and the 1905 revolution, which forced Tsar Nicholas II to grant a constitution and establish a parliament, the Duma.1914 - Russian-Austrian rivalry in Balkans contributes to outbreak of World War One, in which Russia fights alongside Britain and France.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood in St Petersburg1917 - Nicholas II abdicates.

The initial shock forced the stock market in Russia to close temporarily and saw the rouble tumble as people queued up at cash machines. The Institute for International Finance had predicted the Russian economy would shrink by 15% in 2022 and last March, US President Joe Biden said it was ""on track to be cut in half"". What support is China giving Russia? However, for most of 2022, Russia was able to continue exporting energy.Western limits to energy exports were only applied gradually during the year, and while imports to Europe fell sharply during the year, a steady stream of buyers in China, India and elsewhere stepped in to buy up the oil which Europe would not. Rising global prices for oil, gas, petroleum products and other Russian exports, including food and fertilizers, helped to boost Russia´s export revenues.While hundreds of Western companies withdrew from Russia, local entrepreneurs picked up the slack. After McDonald´s sold its restaurants there, for instance, the new owner reopened them in June under a new name ""Vkusno i Tochka"", meaning ""Tasty and That´s It.""Although manufacturing and retail trade were some of the sectors which saw a decline in 2022, agriculture, construction and hospitality all grew, according to Russia´s federal statistics service.Producing equipment for Russia´s armed forces has also kept the country´s factories busy, boosting the economy by making weapons instead of cars. Military security and public administration expanded by 4.1% last year.The sanctions imposed have also been far from watertight. Despite attempts to isolate Russia from the Western financial system, traders have found ways to get money into and out of Russia, through barter, routing transactions through countries which are not taking part in sanctions, or even using cryptocurrencies.  That is not to say that sanctions have not made a significant dent - and some of the impact will be long term. Difficulty getting high-tech imports such as microchips will hold back manufacturing. Experts expect output from oil and gas fields to decline over time without investment, know-how and equipment from the West. The Russian government is predicting that the economy will shrink by 0.8%, but the International Monetary Fund reckons it will grow by 0.3%, partly because of the strength of its exports.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaGDPEconomic growthJoe Biden",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64708832,20,2,2023,"['russia', 'economy', 'oil', 'western', 'ukraine', 'exports', 'sanctions', 'shrinks', 'expected', 'tech', 'invasion', 'country', 'statistics', 'high', 'prices', 'military', 'helped', 'support', 'hundreds', 'withdrew']",0.2621384297520661,0.017751377410468318,20/2/2023

Ukraine said on Thursday it had secured the release of 1,863 men and women in prisoner swaps since the full-scale invasion began. These are highly sensitive operations, often taking months to arrange.Under the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war must not be paraded or exposed to the public.We were allowed to approach who we wanted and asked for their consent. But the guards were with us wherever we went and these men were unlikely to have been speaking freely.Many hid their faces to further protect their identities.Image caption, The Ukrainian guards said the prisoners were permitted one phone call every two weeksLast November, a UN human rights report documented abuses by both sides, based on interviews with prisoners who spoke of cases of torture and ill-treatment.Here the guards appeared keen to show they were treating the prisoners well.One fighter said he had been working for a mercenary group. He had been brought to this facility three days earlier, after he was taken prisoner near the eastern town of Soledar, which was captured last month by Russian forces.A handful stared on defiantly. We met the gaze of one prisoner who said he was captured in the Luhansk region on 29 December. ""I hope I will be exchanged and that I won´t have to go back into the army,"" he said.""What if you have no choice?"" I asked.He paused for a second: ""I have some ideas. I could come back by surrendering voluntarily.""Leaving the shelter it became clear that half the prisoners had been wounded. Some had bandaged hands or feet. Others would move with a heavy limp.One young man became emotional as he described how he had lost his leg in a grenade explosion.Image caption, In one workshop at the facility, Russian soldiers were constructing garden furnitureAs we approached the pulsing sound of a compression drill, a small production line came into view where prisoners of war were putting together outdoor furniture sets.They worked, again with their heads down.A local company had a contract with the facility, we were told, and that meant the inmates could make some money too, mostly to spend on cigarettes and sweets.Most prisoners of war are compelled to have jobs like this. Apparently only Russian officers had a choice.At lunchtime the prisoners were marched to a temporary canteen on the top floor. Through the window a Ukrainian flag flapped in the cold wind. They ate quickly and in silence, but for the sound of eating. Then, table by table, in a moment of perfect choreography, they stood together and shouted in Ukrainian: ""Thank you for lunch!"" Image caption, The prisoners eat a lunch of bread, corn soup, and a bowl of barley and meatInmates here are made to watch TV in Ukrainian, including documentaries on Ukrainian history and the southern city of Mariupol, which was all but flattened by a Russian siege and bombardment that lasted for months.Some of the Ukrainian soldiers who had defended Mariupol were part of the last exchange.We asked one inmate whether he understood what he was watching. ""More or less,"" he said. ""I find it educational."" He was unlikely to have said anything unflattering.It is quite possible that some of the Russians in the room could not understand the programme they were having to watch, and they may not have wanted to.The prisoners are allowed one phone call every two weeks, according to the guards. For their families back in Russia these calls are often the first chance they have to find out their sons have been captured.""Where are you? I´ve asked half the city about you!"" one young man´s mother could be heard over the phone.""Mum, wait. I´m in captivity, I can´t say more."" ""With the bloody Ukrainians?"" she said, before breaking down in tears.""That´s it, Mum. Quiet,"" he told her, as the guard stood over him. ""The most important thing is that I´m alive and healthy.""  Some of the prisoners´ calls went unanswered, leaving them hoping for another chance on the phone - and a future prisoner swap.Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Morgan Gisholt Minard.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64637928,16,2,2023,"['prisoners', 'war', 'prisoner', 'ukraine', 'ukrainian', 'captured', 'soldiers', 'facility', 'asked', 'guards', 'phone', 'image', 'back', 'inside', 'camp', 'russians', 'hundreds', 'conscripts', 'mercenaries', 'held']",0.3682883089133088,0.05332341269841269,16/2/2023

Capped in a blue woollen hat, she thrusts her wide pale face close to mine, and says: ""There are people with four or five children who literally have nothing to eat.""Energy bills here now consume more than 70% of household income, according to Moldova´s president.Ala tells me they swallow half of her pension.""When we elected this government, they promised to raise salaries and pensions, but so far we haven´t seen a penny,"" she says.Sunday´s protests, organised by Moldova´s pro-Russian Sor party, are being closely watched by governments across Europe and beyond. Most protesters travelled to the capital city Chisinau by bus, with their costs reportedly covered by the Sor party. Days before the gathering took place, President Maia Sandu warned that Russia was plotting to send military-trained saboteurs into the country, disguised as civilians, to topple her pro-Western government.Russia has said the accusation is an attempt by Moldovan authorities to distract attention from their own social and economic failures.Moldovan government resigns after multiple crisesEU awards Ukraine and Moldova candidate status Moldova braces for blackouts from Ukraine warMoldova, strategically located on the border with Ukraine, and harbouring its own pro-Russian breakaway region, is dependent on Russian gas.Last year Moscow cut its supply to Moldova by half, putting pressure on the government in Chisinau, as it seeks to hold together its Romanian and Russian-speaking populations.Protests over the rising price of gas and electricity began last autumn.Speaking at a public briefing last Monday, President Sandu said that Russia had already attempted to destabilise the situation in Moldova via the energy crisis, which she said ""was expected to cause major discontent among the population and lead to violent protests"".The plan now, she said, involved ""diversionists with military training […] who would undertake violent action, carry out attacks on buildings of state institutions or even take hostages"".Fifty-seven people from nations friendly to Russia - including a group of Serbian football fans and several boxers from Montenegro - were denied entry to Moldova in the past few days, after checks by security services. And Moldova´s airspace was unexpectedly closed for several hours this week.""It´s very clear that Russia is an aggressor state,"" Rosian Vasiloi, head of Moldova´s border police, told the BBC. He said the threat had existed since 24 February, when the Ukraine war began, but he emphasised that it was ""different now; it´s a mix of threats from inside and outside Moldova"".As long as Ukraine continues to fight, and wins the war, he believes the risks for Moldova are lower.""If Ukraine falls, Moldova is next,"" he said. ""But I´m not afraid.""Since the war began, President Sandu´s government has tried to diversify the country´s energy sources, and wean it off dependence on Russian gas, but attacks on Ukraine´s infrastructure and the cost of importing electricity from Romania hasn´t made that easy.She has said the alleged Russian plot would rely on ""internal forces"" such as the opposition Sor party, and has called for parliament to pass tougher security laws.The Sor party is led by Ilan Shor, a fugitive businessman who is currently in Israel after being convicted of involvement in the theft of $1bn from Moldova´s banking system. He was sanctioned by the US and UK last October.Marina Tauber, Sor´s general secretary, who led today´s protest outside parliament, says that her party is not opposed to the EU and wants good relations with all sides.But there are those in the party who admit they would welcome Russian intervention.Image source, EPAImage caption, Marina Tauber of the pro-Russian Sor party says it wants good relations with all sidesOrhei - an hour´s drive north of the capital Chisinau - is a Sor stronghold where we meet party Councillor Iurie Berenchi.""We´re not afraid,"" he told me, ""Because if Russia wanted to take Moldova, they´d do it in half a day.""When asked if he would welcome that, Mr Berenchi is unequivocal.""In my personal opinion, yes,"" he said. ""With Russia we´d be much better off than we are now.""Many people in Chisinau see closer ties with the West as a way to secure Moldova´s independence and democracy at a critical time. President Sandu´s party has a solid majority in parliament.  But the view from the crowd outside that parliament on Sunday was different, and there´s the risk the pressure could widen the splits in Moldova´s diverse society. The risk is clear when Ala and her friends were asked whether they believe Russia wants to infiltrate Moldova, as their president fears.""Yes, let them come!"" they shout.  ""We want them to come here. We want to be part of Russia!""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warGlobal energy crisisRussiaCost of livingMoldova",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64700590,20,2,2023,"['moldova', 'party', 'ukraine', 'russia', 'sor', 'pro', 'government', 'president', 'protests', 'energy', 'parliament', 'gas', 'country', 'chisinau', 'sandu', 'ala', 'half', 'began', 'war', 'wary']",0.3454794520547946,0.06922374429223745,20/2/2023

The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined products with effect from 5 December. Image source, ReutersImage caption, European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gasAn oil price cap approved by Western allies in December also aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (£48) for a barrel of crude oil.Russia´s gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it would cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether.Have the sanctions been effective?Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia´s north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations.The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea.The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world´s major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere.""Moscow is losing out on about $175m (£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from RussiaMajor Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift.Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies.Who is buying Russian oil?India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea.And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India´s oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier.China´s imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year.In 2021, more than half of all Russia´s crude oil exports went to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary.European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere.The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year.But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful.Opec and other major oil producers cut production in late 2022 to sustain prices.Europe still relies on Russian gasReducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia.In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022, according to EU figures.In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none.EU states are increasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar.

The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia.However, ""there aren´t enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity.Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: ´The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries´. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK´s total capacity for gas storage.How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warGlobal energy crisisGazpromRussiaReality CheckNatural gasTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published21 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished5 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published16 hours agoFeaturesHow a tummy-tuck kidnap ended in cartel confusion.

Pump prices hit 149.74p per litre on Monday, lower than last February and down from a record 191.53p in July.The AA said falling global oil prices were behind the drop, calling it ""a huge relief for drivers"".But it said diesel still cost more than last year at 172.21p a litre compared with 153.05p. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said it now cost about £23 less to fill an average-sized 55-litre car with petrol than it did in July, at roughly £82.However, he said petrol prices were ""still historically way above"" what they should be and that the end of a temporary fuel duty cut this March could lead to fresh rises. Petrol stations in cities and towns are also charging up to 10p more for fuel than those in rural parts of the UK, he added. Filling a diesel car now costs a record £100Petrol prices drop from record highsFuel prices began to rise last year as countries ended Covid lockdowns but surged higher when Russia - a major oil producer - invaded Ukraine, sparking concerns about global supplies. By July last year, the cost of filling an average-sized car had hit £105.29, according to the RAC motoring group, while for diesel it was £109.47.The government has cut fuel duty by 5p a litre since February last year to help drivers, with the overall cut worth 6p when VAT is factored in, the AA says. However, the discount is scheduled to end in March. David Cox, an independent energy analyst, told the BBC that concerns over global oil supplies had subsided as countries had found alternatives to Russian crude, sending prices lower. However, he warned oil prices were likely to rise again as China eased its strict Covid rules and fully reopened its economy. ""I think the outlook [for oil and petrol prices] is it will go back up. We´re in for a prolonged period of higher prices.""Rising electric car costsThe news comes as the RAC said the cost of rapid-charging an electric car using a public charging network had increased by about 50% in the past eight months.It now costs an average of 70.32p per kilowatt hour to rapid charge on a pay-as-you-go basis, up from 44.55p last May and from 63.29p last September, the motoring group said.The rises - which are being driven by increasing energy costs - mean that drivers now pay £36 to charge a typical family-sized electric car with a 64kWh battery to the level required to cover around 188 miles, it said. However, it added that those who charged at home were still getting ""great value"", paying about half as much.  The RAC´s electric vehicles spokesman, Simon Williams, said cutting the level of VAT on electricity sold at public chargers to 5% to match what people pay at home would be one way of keeping prices under control.""It continues to be the case that those who can charge at home or at work and who don´t use the public rapid charging network very often get fantastic value - even given the relatively high domestic energy prices right now. ""Sadly, the same can´t be said for people who either can´t charge at home or at work, or who regularly make longer journeys beyond the range of their cars. There´s no question they have to pay far more, and in some cases more than petrol or diesel drivers do to fill up on a mile-for-mile basis.""Related TopicsCost of livingEfficient energy useFuel",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64222643,10,1,2023,"['prices', 'petrol', 'litre', 'car', 'oil', 'russia', 'invaded', 'aa', 'drivers', 'diesel', 'cost', 'charging', 'energy', 'electric', 'charge', 'pay', 'home', 'ukraine', 'motoring', 'group']",0.3364741447636184,0.04895015316067949,10/1/2023

Aliksandr Azarov, leader of Belarusian anti-government organisation BYPOL, claimed responsibility for the attack on Telegram.The Beriev A-50 early warning aircraft was struck by multiple blasts near the Machulishchy airbase.It comes amid increased cooperation between Minsk and Moscow. The strikes damaged front and central parts of the aircraft as well as its radar and antenna, BYPOL said on Telegram.""These were drones. The participants of the operation are Belarusian"", Mr Azarov said.Speaking to the BBC, Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader, said the attack was ""creative"" and ""sophisticated"".""It was very brave because Belarusians are in a situation of the total terror"", he told BBC News. He added that the opposition party was ""definitely helped by locals, helped by military"" to cause damage to the plane.However, it is not possible to confirm the opposition´s account of what happened. Belarus leader: We´ll join Russia in war if attackedBelarus country profile Both the Russian and Belarusian departments of defence are yet to publicly comment on the incident. Separately, a prominent pro-Kremlin channel, Tsargrad TV, confirmed a drone attack on the airbase, but blamed it on the Ukrainian military. It also reported damage to the A-50, but did not give specific details.A Russian air defence expert, Yuri Knutov, told the channel that for some reason the airbase had not been protected by Russian Pantsir anti-aircraft missiles. He described the A-50 as an airborne command centre used for directing Russian air strikes.BYPOL, the Belarusian group that has claimed responsibility for the strike on the aircraft, consists of former law enforcement officers now opposed to President Alexander Lukashenko´s office. It has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Mr Lukashenko´s government. While Belarus has not directly become involved in the war in Ukraine, Mr Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to launch into Ukraine through Belarus.The two countries have also been participating in joint military training exercises over recent months.

Andrey Medvedev, 26, crossed the border into Norway last Friday, where he was detained by border guards. He is currently being held in the Oslo area where he faces charges of illegal entry to Norway, his lawyer Brynjulf Risnes told the BBC.Mr Risnes said his client left Wagner after witnessing war crimes in Ukraine. The Norwegian Border Guard confirmed to the BBC that a Russian man had been detained after crossing the country´s 198km (123 mile) long border with Russia, but said it could not comment further for ""reasons of security and privacy"". Tarjei Sirma-Tellefsen, police chief of staff in the Norwegian region of Finnmark, said a man had been detained by a border patrol and said he had applied for asylum. But the Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, who helped Mr Medvedev leave Russia, confirmed his identity. His escape is believed to be the first known instance of one of the group´s soldiers defecting to the West. Gulagu.net´s founder Vladimir Osechkin told the BBC that Mr Medvedev had joined the paramilitary group in July 2022 on a four-month contract, but had deserted after witnessing a host of human rights abuses and war crimes while serving in Ukraine. He said that Mr Medvedev is a former soldier in the Russian army and that he later served time in prison between 2017 and 2018 before joining the Wagner Group. He was placed in charge of a Wagner division in Ukraine, where the mercenary group supplied him with around 30-40 troops every week, Mr Osechkin said. In a video posted by Gulagu.net to its social media channels, Mr Medvedev said he fled Ukraine in November after being informed that the group intended to extend his contract indefinitely.What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Ukraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forcesAfter spending two months underground in Russia, he crossed the border into Norway last week. Mr Risnes said his client had also witnessed a host of war crimes while fighting in Ukraine, including seeing ""deserters being executed"" by the Wagner Group´s internal security service. ""In short he felt betrayed and wanted to leave as soon as possible,"" Mr Risnes said. He added that he believed Mr Medvedev had taken some evidence of war crimes with him to Norway and that he intends to share his information with groups investigating war crimes in the coming weeks. In response, the founder of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, appeared to laugh off the allegations.In a press release from one of his companies, Prigozhin issued a sarcastic statement, linking Mr Medvedev to a non-existent Nordic mercenary unit and said he was a Norwegian citizen, in an apparent attempt to mock the man´s testimony.Prigozhin also accused him of ""mistreatment of prisoners"" and said that his former employee was ""very dangerous"". Mr Risnes told the BBC that the Wagner leader´s claims were not true. UK officials believe the Wagner Group makes up about 10% of Russia´s forces in Ukraine, and played a significant part in helping Moscow´s forces take the town of Soledar in eastern Donbas region last week. Thousands of its troops have been recruited from Russian prisons. Mr Prigozhin - a former convict himself - has promised recruits their freedom in exchange for six months service in Ukraine. Before the invasion of Ukraine, it had only a few thousand mercenaries. Most were believed to be experienced former soldiers, including some from Russia´s elite regiments and special forces.Since 2015, it is believed to have deployed troops to Syria, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic.

Speaking to French media, Mr Macron urged Western nations to increase military support for Kyiv and said he was prepared for a protracted war.""I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,"" he said.But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to ""crush"" the nation.The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.""I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,"" Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche.""Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position."" Addressing the conference in Munich on Friday, Mr Macron insisted that now was not the time for dialogue with Moscow.But he did not shy away from mentioning peace talks as a final goal.The president suggested that Ukrainian military efforts, supported by allies, were the only way to ""bring Russia back to the table and build a lasting peace"".He also dismissed the prospect of regime change in Russia, describing similar efforts around the world as a ""total failure"".Despite Mr Macron´s comments, negotiations are a faraway prospect for Ukraine´s leaders.On Friday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision to not invite Moscow to the Munich conference.Russian leaders should not be invited to the table as long as the ""terrorist state kills, as long as it uses bombs, missiles and tanks as an argument for international politics"", he said.President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out immediate talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, insisting there was ""no trust"" between the parties. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, he also dismissed the idea of giving up territory to strike a peace deal with Moscow.Mr Macron has previously been criticised by some Nato allies for sending what they believe are mixed messages on Ukraine.Last June, he was condemned by Mr Kuleba for saying it was vital that Russia was not ""humiliated over its invasion"".Mr Kuleba at the time responded that Russia - which was ""humiliating itself"" - needed to be put in its place.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warFranceVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaEmmanuel MacronVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64693691,19,2,2023,"['russia', 'ukraine', 'macron', 'war', 'leaders', 'peace', 'moscow', 'defeated', 'crushed', 'talks', 'president', 'position', 'munich', 'conference', 'kuleba', 'emmanuel', 'shy', 'mentioning', 'final', 'defeat']",0.35555555555555557,0.026388888888888885,19/2/2023

Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country. His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014. He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine´s neutral status.President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine´s elected president. ""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser. Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine.For years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century.In Kherson: Joy, tears and talk of justiceHow Putin changed his war aimsA month into the invasion and his campaign goals were dramatically scaled back after a retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. The main goal became the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine´s two industrial regions in the east of Luhansk and Donetsk.Forced into further retreats from Kharkiv in the north-east and Kherson in the south, that aim remains unchanged, but it has shown little success in achieving it.Those reverses on the battlefield rushed Russia´s leader into annexing four Ukrainian provinces last September, without having full control of any of them: neither Luhansk or Donetsk in the east, nor Kherson or Zaporizhzhia to the south. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vladimir Putin celebrated annexing Ukrainian territory: ""Together forever"" is written at the top of the screenTo bolster his depleted forces President Putin announced Russia´s first mobilisation since World War Two, although it was partial and limited to some 300,000 reservists. A war of attrition is now taking place along an active front line of 850km (530 miles) and Russian victories are small and rare. What was meant to be a quick operation is now a protracted war that Western leaders are determined Ukraine should win. Any realistic prospect of neutrality for Ukraine is long gone.Russia must be defeated but not crushed - MacronPresident Putin warned in December that the war ""could be a lengthy process"", but then added later that Russia´s goal was ""not to spin the flywheel of military conflict"", but to end it. There is little hope of that on the horizon.A year into the war, he talks of Russia fighting to defend its ""historical frontiers"" and ""rebuilding peaceful life in Donbas and Novorossiya"", spelling out that Ukraine´s southern territories are part of his project, just as much as the east.What gains has Russia made?The biggest success President Putin can lay claim to is establishing a land bridge from Russia´s border to Crimea, annexed illegally in 2014, so it is no longer reliant on its bridge over the Kerch Strait. He has spoken of the capture of this territory, which includes the cities of Mariupol and Melitopol, as a ""significant result for Russia"". The Sea of Azov, inside the Kerch Strait, ""has become Russia´s internal sea"", he declared, pointing out that even Russian Tsar Peter the Great did not manage that. Tracking the war in mapsIs Russia losing the war?Beyond seizing a territorial corridor to Crimea, Russia´s bloody, unprovoked war has been a disaster for itself and the country it was unleashed on. So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military.While cities such as Mariupol were flattened, details of war crimes have emerged against civilians in Bucha, near Kyiv, and have led to an independent report that accused Russia itself of state-orchestrated incitement to genocide.But it is the military failures that have shown Russia at its weakest:The retreat of 30,000 Russian troops across the Dnipro river from Kherson in November was a strategic failureA 56km (35-mile) armoured convoy that ground to a halt near Kyiv at the start of the war was a logistical failureThe deaths of a large number of recently mobilised troops in a Ukrainian new-year missile attack on Makiivka were an intelligence failureThe sinking of the flagship Black Sea battle cruiser the Moskva was a defensive failure, as was the spectacular attack in October 2022 that shut the Kerch Strait bridge for weeks.Russia´s warnings to the West against arming Ukraine have gone unheeded, with Western assurances of support ""for as long as it takes"" and pledges that Nato will never be divided. Superior US Himars missiles helped turn the course of the war and German Leopard 2 tanks are promised, even if Western fighter jets are not. A succession of Western leaders, including President Joe Biden, have made the complex journey to Kyiv.But this war is not over. The fight for Donbas continues. Russia has captured the town of Soledar this year and has hopes of seizing the eastern city of Bakhmut on the road to key cities to the west, and of recapturing territory it lost last autumn.Putin watchers believe he will seek to extend control of the four regions that he has declared to be part of Russia, not just in Donbas, but towards the key city of Zaporizhzhia.Should he need to, President Putin could extend mobilisation and drag out the war. Russia is a nuclear power and he has indicated he would be prepared, if necessary, to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia and cling on to occupied Ukrainian land. ""We will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,"" he warned.Image source, BBC/Goktay KoraltanImage caption, Ukrainian troops are doggedly holding on to Bakhmut amid fierce Russian attacksKyiv believes Russia is also seeking to depose the pro-European government in Moldova, where Russian troops are based in the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering Ukraine.Can we say how many Russians have died?Neither Russia nor Ukraine give details of their own losses, so reliable numbers are extremely difficult. But Russians losses have been especially heavy in recent weeks, with several hundred deaths every day on the battlefields of the east.BBC Russian has identified more than 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in the first year of war and suggests the most conservative estimate would be at least double that, with more than 100,000 others wounded or missing.UK defence intelligence believes Russian casualties increased significantly after partial mobilisation, reaching 175-200,000 in total, of whom 40-60,000 were killed.Ukraine revealed at the end of 2022 that 10-13,000 of its soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. That figure cannot be confirmed, but it followed a US estimate of some 100,000 Ukrainians killed or wounded by November. Before Western artillery arrived in the east last summer, Kyiv officials said 100 to 200 troops were dying every day.The UN human rights commissioner says at least 8,006 civilians have died and 13,287 have been wounded in 12 months of war, but the true number is likely to be substantially higher.Has Putin been damaged?President Putin, 70, has sought to distance himself from military failures, but his authority, at least outside Russia, has been shredded and he makes few trips beyond its borders.At home, Russia´s economy on the surface appears to have weathered a series of Western sanctions for now, although its budget deficit has soared and oil and gas revenue has fallen dramatically.Any attempt to gauge his popularity is fraught with difficulty.Dissent in Russia is highly risky, with jail sentences handed out for anyone spreading ""fake news"" about the Russian military. Those opposing Russia´s leadership have either fled or, as with main opposition figure Alexei Navalny, been thrown into prison.Ukraine´s shift to the WestThe seeds of this war were sown in 2013, when Moscow persuaded Ukraine´s pro-Russian leader to scrap a planned pact with the European Union, prompting protests that ultimately brought him down and led to Russia seizing Crimea and staging a land-grab in the east.Four months into Russia´s 2022 invasion, the EU granted Ukraine candidate status and Kyiv is pushing to be accepted as soon as it can.Russia´s long-time leader was also desperate to prevent Ukraine from entering Nato´s orbit, but his attempt to blame the Western defensive alliance for the war is false.Not only did Ukraine reportedly agree before the war a provisional deal with Russia to stay out of Nato but, in March, President Zelensky offered to maintain Ukraine as a non-aligned, non-nuclear state:  ""It´s a truth and it must be recognised.""How will the war end?No end is currently in sight. Ukraine´s position is that Russian troops must pull back beyond Ukraine´s internationally recognised borders for there to be peace. It is backed by two UN resolutions, passed days after the invasion and hours before the first anniversary of the war.By annexing four regions Russia does not even fully control, Vladimir Putin has made it very hard for himself to give them up.There is little prospect for now of a ceasefire or peace talks. Turkey had some success last summer with the UN in mediating a deal on resuming grain exports through the Black Sea but has had no success since. China is looking for a role in securing a political settlement, but its position is probably too close to Russia to be considered an honest broker.Was Nato to blame for the war?Nato member states have increasingly sent Ukraine air defence systems to protect its cities, as well as missile systems, artillery and drones that helped turn the tide against Russia´s invasion.But it is not to blame for the war and has no troops on the ground. Nato´s expansion comes as a response to the Russian threat - Sweden and Finland only applied to join because of the invasion. Blaming Nato´s expansion eastwards is a Russian narrative that has gained some ground in Europe. Before the war, President Putin demanded Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and remove its forces and military infrastructure from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics.In his eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand ""not an inch to the east"", yet did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev referred merely to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany.Mr Gorbachev said later that ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time.Nato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, From May: Sweden and Finland formally submit Nato applicationsWhat are your questions about the war in Ukraine?

They´re wondering now if they´ll have to fight here again.On Friday, veterans of that conflict gathered in Molovata Noua for an annual pilgrimage across the line of control into Transnistria, to honour those who died.Two dozen men in military fatigues, bright medals on their chests and darkness behind their eyes. Among them, 62-year-old Vlad Untila.Image caption, Vlad Untila says he´s ready should Molovata Noua need to defend itself against Russia""We´re lucky that Ukraine is defending us at the moment,"" he said, ""but if it kicks off in Moldova, we´re ready to defend this territory again.""Their convoy of cars makes its way down the deserted dirt road from Molovata Noua into the breakaway pro-Russian territory - crossing into enemy territory as they did three decades ago.""See how they look at us,"" Vlad growls, as his car approaches the Russian checkpoint.  A gaggle of armed soldiers eye the convoy, as it carries men in Moldovan military fatigues into separatist territory, turning a blind eye to this eye-catching annual ritual.""Look around you,"" Vlad says, ""this is where we fought - it was all a battlefield.""Now the narrow dirt road cuts through the silent countryside, flanked by brown fields and broken winter trees.""It´s hard because I feel I´m in my own country,"" his friend Constantin joins in. ""It´s my own land, and yet I can´t walk freely here.""A short drive beyond the checkpoint, hidden in brambles by the side of the road, is the first stop on the pilgrimage - a simple blue cross made from metal poles.It marks the spot, 31 years ago, where a local mayor was killed.  The veterans gather round with a garland of flowers and a plastic bottle full of wine, to toast their fallen comrades.They follow the trail of pale blue monuments dotted through this territory, repeating the ritual at every stop, honouring their comrades, siblings, and friends.""We were both snipers,"" Vlad remembers, at the spot his friend Vasea was killed. ""They were shooting at us from that hill over there, from a tank. One of the shrapnel fragments hit him in the neck. He fell to the ground and died in my arms.""As the veterans pass a local Moldovan school, pupils come out to greet them, led by their headmistress Tatiana Rosca.""There were big battles here in 1992,"" Tatiana says.  ""And there are still deep wounds in the souls of the people.  We´re very afraid: we know what war means and we don´t wish it on anyone.""One of her pupils says she´s ready to take up arms if conflict erupts again, as her father and grandfather did 30 years ago.But loyalties here - as in the rest of Moldova - are complicated by history, geography and economics.  Here on the other side of the River Dniester, the pull of Moldovan identity is set against the pull of subsidised Russian gas from Transnistria.The economic gulf with the rest of the country has widened since the start of the war in Ukraine, after Moscow cut gas supplies to Moldova last year.""I´ll be honest,"" the mayor of Molovata Noua, Oleg Gazea, told me. ""It´s very difficult to convince people that life is better in Moldova when they pay a fraction of the price for gas here.""""We can´t talk about freedom and a better life, and at the same time tell them to go across the river and pay 30 times more for their bills - they´ll tell us: are you crazy? But there´s a hidden price [to the cheap gas] - it buys their support.""Some people here firmly believe that Moscow is not a military threat, but an economic ally - and that president Maia Sandu is the one provoking a war by moving closer to the West.""Transnistria is really sticking up for us,"" 59 year old Maria Ursachi tells me.  ""But Moldova is a disappointment. People are afraid to come over the river to talk to us: they have a border control post there and they check our bags. Chisinau doesn´t see us.""Arriving back in Molovata Noua, the veterans end their pilgrimage in the village square by laying red carnations at a memorial to the frozen conflict here.In the years since they fought the pro-Russian separatists, their children have grown up alongside Russian soldiers, Russian language and Russian economic support.""We older men will still form the heart of any resistance"", Vlad tells me, ""even with the involvement of younger men.""Memories of the past, that linger in this tiny Moldovan enclave, are being sharpened by growing fears for the future.

The two countries have a decades-old trusted relationship since the Cold War. Russia is also India´s largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped in recent years largely due to Delhi´s decision to boost domestic defence manufacturing and a widening imports portfolio.The two countries also have a history of diplomatic co-operation - Moscow has vetoed UNSC resolutions over the disputed region of Kashmir.Delhi, however, has talked about the importance of ""the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"" in its past statements on Ukraine.

Within a few days Russian troops attacking from Crimea had seized an area of Ukrainian territory bigger than Switzerland. Ukrainian authorities are yet to explain what went wrong in the south in those early days. To help uncover what happened, the BBC has spoken to military officers, politicians and activists.On 22 February 2022 at 19:15, the secretary of Ukraine´s security council Oleksiy Danilov received a red folder with secret documents. They warned that the president´s life was under imminent threat. Immediately, Mr Danilov contacted the head of the security services, the interior minister, prime minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.But Ukraine´s leadership stopped short of declaring martial law, for now. There was no mobilisation of troops. Just a few weeks before, Ukrainian authorities had described Western warnings of Russian invasion as ""manipulation"" and called on everyone to remain calm.Mr Danilov says the government had detailed information about the planned invasion, including its dates. ""We expected it on 22 February,"" he explains, rolling out a secret map of the Kyiv region. Taken from a Russian commander, he says it confirms intelligence reports that Russia´s initial plan was to invade two days earlier than they actually did. ""Our goal was to avoid any panic inside the country. So, it was crucial to keep it all secret.""Image caption, This secret map dating back to 1989 was seized from a Russian commander and shows the attack plan around KyivIf the Ukrainian authorities knew so much about Moscow´s plans, why were Russian troops able to sweep across the Kherson region in the south so quickly?A strait and a narrow strip of land separate the Crimean peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland, and they were natural obstacles for Russian troops. So too was the extensive network of irrigation channels in the Kherson region.Ukrainian forces just needed to destroy all bridges there to slow down the Russian advance. But that did not happen.Mr Danilov says the authorities are currently investigating this, and until that process is over they cannot give an answer: ""But we are not hiding this fact, we are not putting it away in a drawer.""The Chonhar bridge which crosses the strait between Crimea and Kherson had been mined, Ukraine´s general staff confirmed after the invasion. But it rejected suggestions that the explosives had been defused, saying Russia´s invasion force was 15 times the size of Ukraine´s defence.Critics have argued it was precisely because of that Russian dominance that the bridge should have been destroyed.It is clear Ukrainian forces were not prepared for a scenario in which Russian troops easily crossed into the southern Kherson region. As a result, they had to retreat from the region right from the start. As they withdrew, it took two hours for columns of military vehicles and troops to cross the Antonivskiy bridge near Kherson city, according to Senior Lt Yevhen Palchenko, who defended the bridge over the Dnipro river.Image caption, Ukrainian intelligence expected the full-scale invasion two days before it happened, says Oleksiy DanilovThat indicates Ukraine had concentrated a large number of troops near Crimea. But with the bridges still standing, they were quickly outnumbered and outgunned.""How can you contain their offensive when we had no air defence?"" Lt Palchenko explains. ""Their fighter jets flew in and dropped a whole bunch of bombs, blowing up everything. We lost a lot of men and equipment there.""Speed was crucial for Russian success. Their tactic was to bypass large cities, encircle them and move on. They planned to take Mykolaiv in two days and Odesa in three days, says Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko, who was sent to organise Mykolaiv´s defence. But the Russian plan ended in failure. BBCWe stopped Russia´s forces because the people rose upMaj Gen Dmytro MarchenkoUkrainian militaryWhen Gen Marchenko arrived, there was still no plan to defend the city. ""When I asked where it was, I was told that they still hadn´t put together a map,"" he said.  He took a road map, divided it into four parts and appointed units and commanders responsible for each section. They announced mobilisation and quickly signed up thousands of people. Many of the newcomers had previously served in the army.  They set up anti-tank groups armed with grenade launchers and organised signal posts to warn when Russian tanks approached. In contrast to Kherson, bridges across irrigation channels in the region were destroyed by hastily set up special forces led by MP Roman Kostenko.Ukrainian troops fought fiercely to slow down the Russian advancement near the Antonivskiy bridge. At midnight on 25 February, Russian forces went on the offensive. Lt Palchenko and his tank battalion were there to stop them. ""My tank took a few hits, and the system was down. So, we had to do everything manually, like in T-34 tanks during World War Two.""  Image source, Maj Gen MarchenkoImage caption, Hastily organised Ukrainian defenders blew up bridges around Mykolaiv, halting the Russian invadersThe Russian forces were overwhelming, so Lt Palchenko and his battalion had to retreat from the bridge. But he went back there several times that night. His tanks covered Ukrainian paratroopers and their task was to prevent Russian troops from crossing the bridge.The then-23 year-old was later awarded the country´s top military honour, Hero of Ukraine.Their resistance gave Mykolaiv a few more days to prepare its defences. Co-ordination and communication between military and civilian teams meant that the time was used well.""[Mykolaiv Governor] Vitaliy Kim was amazing at communicating with people to organise help,"" Maj Gen Marchenko remembers. ""We needed excavators - they quickly went and dug [trenches and ditches]. We needed concrete blocks and anti-tank ´hedgehogs´ - in half a day, it was all done.""Local citizens constantly monitored the movement of Russian troops and passed co-ordinates to Ukrainian gunners. Ordinary people destroyed armoured vehicles and took prisoners, says Maj Gen Marchenko.""We stopped Russia´s forces because the people rose up,"" he adds.Additional reporting by Anna Tsyba.Related TopicsUkrainian governmentRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaCrimeaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64718740,27,2,2023,"['ukrainian', 'ukraine', 'troops', 'forces', 'russia', 'days', 'bridge', 'region', 'kherson', 'gen', 'invasion', 'mykolaiv', 'south', 'authorities', 'military', 'danilov', 'secret', 'map', 'plan', 'quickly']",0.29972619047619053,0.037880952380952376,27/2/2023

Leading MP Doina Gherman told Moldovan media that the Russian allegations were ""aggressive disinformation"". There was no imminent threat and she urged the public to trust the government.Moldovan President Maia Sandu, on a visit to neighbouring Romania on Thursday, spoke of unprecedented security challenges ahead. ""Some wanted our country to fall and to install in Chisinau a puppet government enslaved to the interests of the Kremlin,"" she said.Moldova is not part of Nato but last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine, bringing it one step closer to joining the bloc. Earlier this week the Moldovan leader met US President Joe Biden, who promised to support her country´s sovereignty.However, on Moldova´s eastern flank lies a narrow strip of land called Transnistria, between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border. This breakaway region has a contingent of Russian peacekeepers, and Moscow has warned that any threat to its security will be treated as an attack on Russia itself.Challenges created by war in UkraineWith a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe´s poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.It has faced a major energy crisis because its power infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era. Not only did Russia restrict its gas supplies but its attacks on Ukraine´s power grid had knock-on effects.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsRampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by the populist and pro-Russian Sor party, led by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor. There has also been an apparent escalation of incidents described by new Prime Minister Dorin Recean as ""hybrid attacks"". A Russian missile was fired at Ukraine through Moldovan airspace on the day the previous government collapsed earlier this month, in the face of what the former PM called ""multiple crises"".Moldovan government resigns after multiple crisesPresident Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova´s leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one ""at the service of Russia"".Shortly after her speech, twelve Serbian football fans were barred from entering Chisinau for a match. Fighters of a boxing club from Montenegro were barred from entering Chisinau for a tournament too.The Kremlin accused Moldova´s leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be ""very, very careful"" with their statements.Political analyst Denis Cenusa said Moldova´s weakest point for pro-Russian forces was its internal socio-economic stability. If Russia failed in the short term, he said it could succeed at the ballot box in local elections this year and the presidential vote in 2024.Find a solution for TransnistriaDominated by Russian speakers, Transnistria proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by 1,500 Russian troops stationed there.As long as Transnistria´s future remains unclear, tensions will remain. Moldova´s new prime minister sees demilitarising the area as a priority and the foreign ministry has said it will continue to seek a peaceful solution.But President Putin has pointedly revoked a 2012 decree committing Russia to finding a solution for Transnistria based on respect for Moldova´s sovereignty and territorial integrity.As soon as Russian forces invaded southern Ukraine a year ago there were fears they would try to seize Odesa and the entire coast to Transnistria.  That has not happened, but what Moldova´s leaders are warning of now is reminiscent of what happened in April 2022.A series of mysterious explosions were reported, which separatist authorities in Transnistria said targeted their state security HQ, old Soviet-era radio masts and a military unit.Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" were held responsible then as well by Transnistria´s authorities. Kyiv blamed Russian special services, warning they were seeking to threaten Moldova and destabilise the situation.Earlier this week a pro-separatist social media channel said it had seen Ukrainian military equipment on the motorway linking Ukraine to Moldova, but an unconvincing photo showed only a couple of small armoured vehicles and a Ukrainian flag.Russia´s defence ministry claimed it had detected a ""significant amount of [Ukrainian] personnel and military vehicles"" near Transnistria and said they carried a direct threat to Russia´s peacekeeping force, but again it offered no evidence.The head of Transnistria´s peacekeeping body, Oleg Belyakov, said there was no panic among its population but Russia´s warnings did ""give reasons for serious concerns"".Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warMoldovaRomaniaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64746801,24,2,2023,"['moldova', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'transnistria', 'government', 'ukrainian', 'war', 'moldovan', 'president', 'warned', 'attack', 'pro', 'ministry', 'psy', 'ops', 'tensions', 'sandu', 'leaders', 'country', 'called']",0.2848900257991167,-0.0020432135204862486,24/2/2023

Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, became a candidate for EU membership last summer. The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed. Moldova - formerly part of the Soviet Union - depends on Russia for natural gas. It has suffered power cuts in the past year, coinciding with Russia´s attacks on Ukraine´s energy infrastructure.President Sandu alleged Russia was planning to use ""saboteurs with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages"".The plot would involve citizens of Russia, Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia entering Moldova, she told a news conference.In depth: War in UkraineMoldova country profile She urged Moldova´s parliament to adopt laws to give the country´s Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) and prosecutors ""the necessary means to fight more efficiently against national security threats"".

Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, 59, and Douglas Robertson, 55, owned and operated the KanRus Trading Company.The two conspired to skirt US export laws to sell sophisticated aviation equipment to Russia, says the US Department of Justice. If convicted, they face a maximum of 20 years in prison for exporting controlled goods without a licence. They are also charged with conspiracy, falsifying and failing to file electronic export information, and smuggling goods contrary to US law.Prosecutors said the two had since 2020 sought to evade US export laws, misstating the value and end destination of shipments by routing them through third-party countries.Between November 2020 and February 2021, they received avionics equipment for repair in the US, according to the justice department, including a computer processor with a sticker for Russia´s secretive security agency.Mr Buyanovsky and Mr Robertson used a fraudulent invoice to identify the destination for the equipment as Germany, says the justice department. The defendants also illegally sent avionics gear through Armenia and Cyprus to Russia without obtaining the proper licences, it is alleged.The investigation was carried out by a justice department unit dedicated to enforcing sanctions imposed on the Russian government since its invasion of Ukraine.

They belong to an organisation called the Wagner Group, which has been used in Russian military operations in many countries.Who are the Wagner Group´s mercenaries? ""Wagner almost certainly now commands 50,000 fighters in Ukraine and has become a key component of the Ukraine campaign,"" according to the UK Ministry of Defence. It says the organisation started recruiting in large numbers last year because Russia had trouble finding people for the regular army.About 80% of its troops in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council.Before Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, it is thought the Wagner Group had only about 5,000 fighters.They were mostly experienced former soldiers - many of them from Russia´s elite regiments and special forces.Although mercenary forces are illegal in Russia, the Wagner Group registered as a company in 2022 and opened a new headquarters in St Petersburg.""It is openly recruiting in Russian cities, on billboards, and is being named in Russian media as a patriotic organisation,"" says Dr Samuel Ramani, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank.US to designate Russia´s Wagner as a criminal groupUproar in Serbia over Wagner recruiting for RussiaWhat is the Wagner Group doing in Ukraine?The Wagner Group has been heavily involved in Russian efforts to capture the city of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine.Ukrainian troops say Wagner fighters have been sent into attacks in large numbers over open ground, with many killed as a result.After Russia claimed to have captured the town of Soledar, near Bakhmut, a row broke out between its defence ministry and the Wagner Group over who should get the credit.At first, the defence ministry did not mention that the Wagner Group was involved in the fighting. However, it then conceded that its mercenaries had played a ""courageous and selfless"" role.Uproar in Serbia over Wagner recruiting for RussiaTanzanian killed in Ukraine: We told him not to goHow was the Wagner Group started? A BBC investigation into the Wagner Group highlighted the believed involvement of a former Russian army officer, Dmitri Utkin. A veteran of Russia´s wars in Chechnya, he is thought to have been Wagner´s first field commander and to have named it after his former radio call sign.The head is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rich businessman nicknamed ""Putin´s chef"" because he provided catering for the Kremlin. Image caption, Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has been seen in leaked footage addressing prisoners in RussiaThe Wagner Group´s first operation was helping Russia annex Crimea in 2014, says Tracey German, professor of conflict and security at King´s College London. ""Its mercenaries are thought to have been some of the ´little green men´ who occupied the region,"" says Prof German, referring to the troops who appeared on the streets of Crimea in uniforms without any identifying markings.In the weeks before Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, it is thought Wagner carried out ""false flag"" attacks to give the Kremlin a pretext for attacking.Russia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarWhere else is the Wagner Group operating? Since 2015, Wagner Group mercenaries have been in Syria, fighting alongside pro-government forces and guarding oilfields.There are also Wagner Group mercenaries in Libya, supporting the forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar.The Central African Republic (CAR) has invited the Wagner Group to guard diamond mines, and it is thought to be guarding gold mines in Sudan. Image source, @RSOTM telegram groupImage caption, Wagner members in SyriaThe government of Mali, in West Africa, is using the Wagner Group against Islamic militant groups.Yevgeny Prigozhin is thought to make money from Wagner Group operations abroad.The US Treasury says he uses its presence to enrich mining companies which he owns and has placed them under sanctions.An unnamed White House spokesman told Reuters that Mr Prigozhin may want the Wagner Group to capture Bakhmut so he can control salt and gypsum mines in the area.

He claims to have witnessed war crimes in Ukraine.Three Wagner Group mercenaries are alleged by Ukrainian prosecutors to have killed and tortured civilians near Kyiv in April 2022, alongside regular Russian troops.German intelligence says Wagner mercenaries may also have massacred civilians in Bucha in March 2022.The United Nations and the French government have accused Wagner mercenaries of committing rapes and robberies against civilians in the Central African Republic.In 2020, the United States military accused Wagner mercenaries of having planted landmines and other improvised explosive devices in and around the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

It presents challenges and huge development opportunities, with a youthful dynamism that, he argues, will be a huge contributor to Europe´s own future growth.France´s president is also acutely aware of how other nations are seeking to extend their own influence south of the Sahara.Russia, hoping to rebuild the influence it had lost since the Cold War decades, is offering security support to governments that feel under threat or isolated from the international mainstream: mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked military contractor Wagner are now operating in Mali and the Central African Republic, where they have been accused of human rights abuses.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Protesters waved a Russian flag outside the French embassy in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, ahead of the president´s visitChina is a massive funder and builder of infrastructure, albeit on terms that Mr Macron fears could trap some countries in debt crisis. Turkey and India are increasingly active too.And across the region, popular anti-French sentiment is fanned by lively social media messaging to which Paris has so far found no effective response.Love Putin, Hate France: How info ops target AfricaIn a lengthy speech on Monday evening, to prepare the ground for his latest tour, the president reasserted his own strategy to sustain a role for France in this increasingly competitive arena. It was a message addressed both to Africans and to his own domestic audience.He does not think the French should try to match the Russian security effort by re-expanding its own military presence to match what Moscow offers.In any case, that would hardly be an option when Paris has been forced to pull its troops out of Mali and Burkina Faso, where the military juntas now in charge are seeking to distance themselves from the former colonial power in both countries.Instead, he aims to re-orient French support to focus more on training and technical back-up for African armed forces, with troop numbers reduced and programmes of military collaboration tailored to the specific requests of individual countries.Image source, AFPImage caption, Some 5,500 French troops were deployed at the height of the jihadist insurgency in MaliAnd this week Mr Macron took that policy a step further, announcing that the remaining French bases in Africa - in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Gabon - would now be co-managed and shared with the forces of the host nations, and even available to welcome other external partners if those governments wished. Only the base in Djibouti, strategically located at the mouth of the Red Sea will remain exclusively French.He pointed out that the base in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is well positioned for training troops from the various West African states now collaborating in efforts to prevent jihadist groups in the Sahel from pushing south towards the coast.But he is also anxious to pursue the diversification of French engagement across a much broader canvas, touching culture, history, immigration, trade, development and even reform of the CFA franc - a currency used by 14 countries and pegged to the euro under a guarantee provided by Paris. There is growing opposition to the use of this currency, which some see as a form of neo-colonialism, although its supporters says it helps ensure financial stability.Mr Macron first launched this approach in a high-profile Africa speech back in November 2017, in front of an audience of students in a lecture theatre at Ouagadougou University in Burkina Faso.And he has pursued it over the past five years, in an effort to transform perceptions from both sides. Previous governments in Paris, particularly in the 1990s, had already sought to move away from the old network of mutually complacent vested special connections between African and French elites encapsulated in the term ""Françafrique"", shifting instead towards stronger support for democracy and grassroots development.Image source, AFPImage caption, President Macron was in Angola´s capital on Friday meeting President João LourençoHowever, Mr Macron has gone further in confronting the painful and sometimes shameful episodes of the past, commissioning historians to produce reports unsparing in their examination of France´s track record in the war over Algerian independence and the events surrounding the Rwandan genocide of 1994.A programme of returning treasures looted during the colonial era has already seen the return home of a totemic Senegalese sword and part of a Malagasy royal throne, while artefacts looted from the kingdom of Dahomey have been sent back to Benin and arrangements have been made for the return of an iconic Ivorian drum.In parallel with this effort at reconciliation over past history, Mr Macron has been seeking to deepen today´s cultural connections and exchange of ideas. He has announced schemes to promote sports training and to ease access to visas for Africans to pursue post-graduate study in France. However, the public impact of these initiatives, particularly in the eyes of African public opinion, has been largely lost during years when the most prominent dimension of French engagement has been the military struggle against militant groups in the Sahel.France calls time on anti-jihadist Sahel operationGrowing controversy came to surround the operations of the French force Barkhane, finally withdrawn from Mali in August last year. This has fuelled an upsurge in populist nationalism in some countries and a more generalised resentment of France across most of Francophone West and Central Africa, particularly among urban youth.Having instigated a shift towards a lower profile and more collaborative military approach, Mr Macron is trying to use this week´s four-country tour to reinvigorate this broader reform and change agenda.But even this trip will be beset by familiar political complications. There have been anti-French demonstrations in the Democratic Republic of Congo ahead of his visit. Furthermore opponents of Gabon´s President Ali Bongo Ondimba and DR Congo´s President Félix Tshisekedi have been complaining that Mr Macron´s visit could be read as interference to bolster the image of these incumbent rulers in what is an election year for both countries.Related TopicsFranceEmmanuel MacronMaliDemocratic Republic of Congo",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64822485,4,3,2023,"['french', 'macron', 'president', 'france', 'military', 'africa', 'african', 'countries', 'paris', 'russia', 'back', 'republic', 'image', 'congo', 'emmanuel', 'afpimage', 'gabon', 'tour', 'colonial', 'ahead']",0.35178571428571453,0.05007971938775512,4/3/2023

What is Russia´s ´kamikaze´ drone?Ukraine´s government and Western intelligence agencies say Russia has been using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the conflict since autumn last year.Also called the Geranium-2 by Russia, it has explosives in a warhead on its nose and is designed to loiter over a target until it is instructed to attack.The Shahed-136 has a wingspan of about 2.5m (8.2ft) and can be hard to detect on radar. Iran´s government says it supplied ""a small number"" of drones to Russia before the war.But the US and the European Union have accused Iran of sending regular deliveries of drones to Russia, and the EU has imposed sanctions in response. Defence experts think Russia may be using Shahed-136 drones rather than cruise missiles for air attacks because they are relatively cheap - about $20,000 (£17,800) each. What damage have kamikaze drones done in Ukraine?Russia was first reported to have used a Shahed-136 drone on 13 September, attacking military targets in the Kharkiv region in the east of the country.Since then, Russia has made repeated attacks with drones on both military and civilian targets in the areas of Kyiv, Odesa and Mykolaiv. Ukraine says Russia launched more than 80 Iranian-made Shahed drones on 1 January and 2 January, but claims to have shot all of them down.Russia often targets power stations, to deprive Ukraine´s population of electricity and heating during the winter months. How is Ukraine trying to combat them? Ukrainian armed forces have used small arms fire, heavy machine guns, portable anti-air missiles and electronic jamming devices to try and shoot down drones. This can be difficult when they are sent in large numbers, or ""swarms"".However, Ukraine says its air defences have managed to shoot down over 80% of all the drones Russia has sent against it. Has Ukraine used ´kamikaze´ drones?The US has said it is supplying Ukraine with 700 of its Switchblade kamikaze drones, but it is not known whether any have yet been used.Experts say Ukraine used kamikaze drones of some sort last autumn to attack a Russian military base in western Crimea, an airbase near Sevastopol, and ships in Sevastopol harbour.Russia says Ukraine also used kamikaze drones in December for three separate attacks on airbases at Saratov and Ryazan - both hundreds of miles inside Russian territory.What other drones do Ukraine and Russia have?Ukraine´s main military drone is the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2. It is about the size of a small plane, has cameras on board, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs.A Bayraktar drone was used in the attack which sank the Russian warship Moskva in the Black Sea in April 2022.Russia also uses the smaller, more basic Orlan-10, which has cameras and can carry small bombs. How have military drones been used?  For both sides - Russia and Ukraine - drones have been effective for locating enemy targets and guiding artillery fire toward them.In the past, observers might have had to spend 20 or 30 minutes pinpointing a target, says Dr Jack Watling, defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute.Now, however, he says: ""Russian forces can bring their guns to bear on the enemy within only three to five minutes of an Orlan-10 drone spotting the target.""Dr Marina Miron, defence researcher at Kings College London, says drones have allowed Ukraine to stretch its limited forces.""If you wanted to seek out enemy positions in the past, you would have had to send out special forces units... and you might have lost some troops,"" she says. ""Now, all you´re risking is a drone.""Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian Orlan-10 drones can target artillery fire on enemy positions within minutesThe main problem in using military drones is that they are large and slow moving, and are easy to shoot down. They are also expensive to replace - a single Bayraktar TB2 costs about $2m (£1.7m).How are non-military drones being used?Both sides in the war - but especially Ukraine - have increasingly been using small, cheap commercial models of drone such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs about £1,700. These can be fitted with small bombs, but are mainly used to spot enemy troops and to direct attacks.However, commercial drones are much less capable than military ones. For example, the DJI Mavic´s total flying distance is only 30km, and it can only fly for a maximum of 46 minutes. Russia is using electronic devices to counter them, says Dr Miron.""Russian forces have the Stupor rifle, which shoots electromagnetic pulses,"" she says. This stops commercial drones from being able to navigate using GPS, she explains.Russian forces have also used online systems, such as Aeroscope, to detect and interrupt communications between commercial drones and their operators.These systems can cause a drone to crash or return to base, and can stop it sending back information.

The fight for Bakhmut has gone on for more than six months and has become the main focus of the Russian offensive in the east. The campaign is believed to have cost thousands of lives.Never one to hold back, Prigozhin complained that Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov not only prevented ammunition from being sent but did not help with air transport or even providing shovels for digging trenches. Such direct opposition within the military to equipping his fighters amounted to treason, he said.What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Why so many Russians turn a blind eye to warWhen the ministry denied his allegations, he hit back describing its statement as ""spitting"" at Wagner, complaining it had not received 80% of the ammunition requested to carry out its combat missions.He then posted a picture, apparently from the Bakhmut area, of the corpses of dozens of mercenaries killed in battle lying on the frozen ground awaiting collection.""These are the guys who died yesterday because of so-called ´shell shortages´. There are five times more of them than there should have been,"" he said in an audio message to his press service.He called on Russians to demand publicly, but without resorting to demonstrations, that the defence ministry give ammunition to his troops.The raw power struggle at the heart of Russia´s war in Ukraine has prompted commentators to speculate whether Prigozhin is being squeezed out by Gen Gerasimov, who was recently put in charge of the campaign.Pro-Kremlin pundit Sergei Markov said Russians who backed the war were clearly backing Prigozhin and the squabble would undermine the defence ministry´s authority.Russia expert Mark Galeotti said that if ammunition was being withheld then, along with the rotation of Wagner troops away from Bakhmut, ""it sets [the] scene for regulars to deliver Putin his first victory (however meaningless) for some time"".""We will not leave Bakhmut,"" vowed Prigozhin in his audio message. ""We´ll simply die in double the numbers until all [the Wagnerites] are finished. And when the Wagnerites are completely finished, most likely Shoigu and Gerasimov will have to pick up machine guns.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64731945,22,2,2023,"['prigozhin', 'wagner', 'ammunition', 'ukraine', 'russia', 'defence', 'ministry', 'bakhmut', 'chief', 'russians', 'mercenaries', 'war', 'town', 'mercenary', 'troops', 'group', 'wagnerites', 'gerasimov', 'blames', 'shortage']",0.36718920535247057,0.0011407639979068528,22/2/2023

The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they´re considering providing lethal support,"" he said. He did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China´s potential plans. When pressed on what the US believed China might give to Russia, he said it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition.The US has sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly providing satellite imagery of Ukraine to the mercenary Wagner Group, which supplies Russia with thousands of fighters. Mr Blinken told CBS that ""of course, in China, there´s really no distinction between private companies and the state"".What support is China offering Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?If China provided Russia with weapons, that would cause a ""serious problem for us and in our relationship"", he added.Relations between Washington and Beijing were already poor after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in early February. Both sides exchanged angry words, but equally both sides appeared embarrassed by the incident and seemed ready to move on.But if China were to deliver weapons to help Russian forces in Ukraine, then US-Chinese relations would deteriorate much more severely.It would be the most ""catastrophic"" thing that could happen to the relationship between the two giants, said top Republican senator Lindsay Graham.""It would be like buying a ticket on the Titanic after you saw the movie,"" he told ABC News. ""Don´t do this.""Mr Blinken´s warning seems to be clearly designed to deter China from doing that.Mr Blinken also said the US was worried about China helping Russia evade Western sanctions designed to cripple Russia´s economy. China´s trade with Russia has been growing, and it is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas, and coal.Nato members, including the US, are sending a variety of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, including tanks. They have stopped short of sending fighter jets, and Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether the US would help other countries supply jets.""We´ve been very clear that we shouldn´t fixate or focus on any particular weapons system,"" he said. He did, however, say that the West must ensure Ukraine had what it needed for a potential counter offensive against Russia ""in the months ahead"". Russia is currently trying to advance in eastern regions of Ukraine, where some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place.The top US diplomat´s remarks come ahead of a scheduled visit by Mr Wang to Moscow, as part of the Chinese foreign policy chief´s tour of Europe.Mr Wang said in Munich on Saturday that China had ""neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire"" for the Ukraine war, Reuters reported.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chinese foreign affairs Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech in Munich on SaturdayChina would publish a document that laid out its position on settling the conflict, Mr Wang said. The document would state that the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, he said.""I suggest that everybody starts to think calmly, especially friends in Europe, about what kind of efforts we can make to stop this war,"" Mr Wang said.He added that there were ""some forces that seemingly don´t want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon"", but did not say who he meant. The Chinese President, Mr Xi, is scheduled to deliver a ""peace speech"" on the anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, 24 February, according to Italy´s foreign minister Antonio Tajani.Mr Tajani told Italian radio that Mr Xi´s speech would call for peace without condemning Russia, Reuters reported.During their meeting, Mr Blinken and Mr Wang also exchanged strong words on the deepening row over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the US. Mr Blinken said during the meeting that the US would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Blinken told CBS that other nations were concerned about what he called China´s ""surveillance balloon program"" across five continents.Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"". China has denied sending a spy balloon.And on Sunday morning, Beijing warned that the US would ""bear all the consequences"" if it escalated the argument over the balloon. China would ""follow through to the end"" in the event ""the US insists on taking advantage of the issue"", it said in a foreign ministry statement reported by Reuters.The full interview with CBS - the BBC´s US broadcasting partner - is due to air on Sunday.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64695042,20,2,2023,"['china', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'blinken', 'weapons', 'wang', 'war', 'support', 'beijing', 'lethal', 'foreign', 'balloon', 'cbs', 'give', 'ammunition', 'denied', 'state', 'providing', 'information', 'provide']",0.3538184888588115,0.013055148256761153,20/2/2023

The very same morning in Bucha, just outside Kyiv, 67-year-old Volodymyr Scherbynyn was standing outside his local supermarket when more than a hundred Russian military vehicles rolled into town. Both Volodymyr and the satellite were witnesses to a key part of President Vladimir Putin´s plan for a quick and overwhelming victory. They were also witnesses to its failure.The western media called it a convoy. In reality, it was a traffic jam and a major tactical blunder. Forty-eight hours after that first satellite photograph, on 28 February 2022, the line of vehicles had grown to a colossal 35 miles (56 km) long. The vehicles were stalled for weeks. Then finally they retreated, and seemingly disappeared overnight.  What happened? Why did such a massive force fail to reach Kyiv?A BBC team spoke to dozens of witnesses; including military personnel, national and international intelligence services, civilians, veterans, and the territorial defence, all of whom came into contact with the convoy. It also gained access to Russian maps and documents that shed light on what the plan actually was, and why it went so spectacularly wrong.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Satellite images of the convoy captured last year © 2022 Maxar TechnologiesThe first hoursThe story starts on the first day of the war, in the north of Ukraine at its border with Belarus.Stepping outside for his first cigarette of the day, 23-year-old Vladyslav from Ukraine´s 80th Air Assault Brigade saw a flurry of bright lights in the night sky. ""I remember watching the lights emerge from the whole forest. At first I thought they were car headlights. But then I realised they were Grads [self-propelled multiple missile launchers]. They were firing at us."" Camped deep within the forest of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Vladyslav´s unit was on patrol when the first Russian vehicles crossed into Ukraine.""The whole earth was shaking. Have you ever been in a tank? There´s no other sound like it. It´s a powerful thing.""As planned in the event of any attack, Vladyslav and the rest of the 80th brigade blew up the bridge connecting Chernobyl to the next big town, Ivankiv.The Russians would be forced to waste time building a replacement pontoon bridge, giving Vladyslav and his unit time to pull back to Kyiv. ""At first I was surprised, why didn´t we stop them there in Chernobyl? But we needed to learn about our enemy. So that´s what we did."" This close to the Belarus border, the Ukrainians could not afford to open fire and risk starting another conflict. Their priority was to first understand Russia´s battle plan, before sending their troops into the line of fire. Putin´s master planWhat Vladyslav saw were the first vehicles of what would become the convoy.Contrary to many media reports at the time, the 35 mile-long (56 km) column was in fact 10 separate Russian tactical battalion units, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.The Russian army also attacked Ukraine in the east and south, but the mission for these 10 units was specific - enter Ukraine from Belarus, overthrow Ukraine´s capital city and remove the government. In military terms: a decapitation attack.One Russian document, seen by the BBC, shows a timetable for the plan. After the first battalion crossed into Ukraine at 04:00 am on 24 February, their orders were to advance straight to Kyiv arriving by 14:55. Several of the battalions were to advance to Hostomel, just north of Kyiv, to back up the troops who´d been airlifted in to secure the airport.The rest were to head straight into the centre of Kyiv. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Luibov Demydiv (R), a pensioner from Demydiv, points on the map to where she saw the convoy circling after a bridge was destroyed, stopping their advanceThe assault heavily relied on two elements - secrecy and speed.According to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) (a UK-based security think tank) by keeping plans about an attack on the capital under wraps, Russian soldiers could outnumber the Ukrainian forces by 12 to one in the north of Kyiv.However, Putin´s secrecy came at a cost. So successful was his deception, even most of his commanders did not receive their orders until 24 hours before the invasion. On a tactical level, this left them vulnerable. They lacked food, fuel and maps. They were without proper communication tools. They had insufficient ammunition. They were even ill-prepared for the winter weather.Kitted out with the wrong tyres and surrounded by snow, the Russians drove straight into a mud bath. Civilians close to Ivankiv describe Russian soldiers telling Ukrainian farmers to help pull their tanks out of the sludge. How war is seen in rural RussiaHas Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checkedUnable to progress, the Russian vehicles needed to divert to paved roads in order to avoid soft ground, forcing thousands to group into a single column. But with limited communication between the battalions, they almost immediately converged into one almighty traffic jam.  As one military expert on the ground put it: ""You don´t ever travel into hostile territory in a long convoy. Ever.""Based on witness testimony and intelligence from the Ukrainian military, we were able to map the ground the convoy covered in the time between the outbreak of war and the end of March. By avoiding travelling across fields, vehicles ended up on most of the main roads north of Kyiv.By the time the column had grown as long as 35 miles (56 km) it included up to 1,000 tanks, 2,400 mechanised infantry vehicles and 10,000 personnel, as well as dozens of supply trucks carrying food, fuel, oil and ammunition.  Stalled north of Kyiv and running out of food and fuel, the Russians had also underestimated their adversary. A united resistanceFor three days Volodymyr Scherbynyn and his fellow volunteers, the majority of them pensioners, had been preparing for the arrival of the convoy in their hometown of Bucha.Armed with one machine gun between the 12 of them, they took down all the road signs, built checkpoints, and prepared hundreds of petrol bombs.Until finally, on Sunday morning the Russian tanks rolled into town. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Maksym (L) Volodymyr (C) and ´""the colonel"" (R) stand in front of their bombed out office for local volunteersFor nearly 30 minutes, Volodymyr and his grassroots unit battered the tanks with what little they had.""We set two of the vehicles on fire and slowed down the whole convoy,"" says Volodymyr.But then came the retaliation. ""When they saw us throwing bottles they opened fire,"" says 30-year-old Maksym Shkoropar. ""I was a barman. I didn´t have any military training.""By the end of that half hour, every one of Volodymyr´s party had been shot and evacuated to hospital.But even from the sick bay, Volodymyr kept on fighting - receiving and cross-checking sightings of the convoy from civilians all over the Kyiv region and calling them in to the Ukrainian authorities.On the other end of the line was 23-year-old local city councillor for Irpin, Roman Pohorily. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Lawyer and councillor by day, Roman searches for Russian posts on social media by night.He tells the BBC he didn´t sleep for three days.""My colleague and I were manning the hotline at the council office, taking calls about the column, as well as saboteurs - people who were painting marks on the ground for the convoy to follow.""A councillor by day, Roman is also an open source intelligence expert by night. Co-founder of the highly regarded website DeepState, he pools together social media and intelligence reports. He geolocates them, then reposts them on his website.  ""On their way to Kyiv, the Russians were posting videos on social media. We reposted the videos to expose their movements. They were just showing off, but in doing so, they got busted."" Most important during the assault on Kyiv, says Roman, was the sense of a united Ukraine. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Ukrainian volunteers distributing food""Everyone was doing something. I admit it was very hectic in those first few days. But there were veterans helping civilians. Everyone wanted to defend their city.""In towns and villages all across the region, hundreds of attacks took place against the convoy, from civilians armed with homemade weapons to mechanised infantry and artillery.Outdated tacticsIn stark contrast to the Ukrainians, the Russian forces repeatedly exposed their inability to make dynamic decisions on the ground. ""The Russians were all carrying large metal boxes marked ´secret´,"" says Vladyslav from the 80th Brigade. ""We seized one during an ambush. We found their maps marked with their entire route. After that we knew their whole strategy.""Their navigation tools were also woefully out of date. In the year since the invasion, the BBC has continued to find maps left behind by Russian troops that date back to the 1960s and 70s. Whole towns exist now that were not on the maps that they were using to navigate. We also found semaphore flags, a vastly outdated way to communicate between units.One successful tactic by the Ukrainian resistance was to blow up bridges and dams ahead of the convoy, thus forcing the Russians to reroute. Reliant on old maps and with limited communications back to their high command, the Russian units frequently became paralysed by indecision.Several satellite images show the Russian vehicles literally driving round and around in circles. Image source, Maxar Technologies 2022OccupationUnder pressure from Ukrainian air strikes and artillery, the Russian convoy was finally brought to a standstill just outside of Kyiv´s city boundary. For thousands of civilians living close to the stalled troops, the experience was horrendous. ""They robbed everything from everywhere. They emptied the shops,"" says Vladyslav. ""They also used civilians as human shields.""What happened in many villages and towns to the north and west of Kyiv is still being investigated by numerous authorities, including the International Criminal Court. After four long weeks the Russians finally started to withdraw.Two of the largest remaining battalions were defeated close to Hostomel airport. Another 370 tented army trucks, seemingly abandoned in Zdvizhivka village, were destroyed by artillery. The Ukrainian military kept on pushing them back until 19 March, after which the Russians began to retreat from Kyiv Oblast.Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, A graveyard of Russian vehicles from the convoy piled high in HostomelRussia is continuing to push into the eastern industrial heartland of Donbas, and strike in the south, in the direction of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.Despite the speculation of a renewed attack on Kyiv, the majority of experts agree it would be unlikely as we have not seen a large-scale deployment of Russian troops to the Belarus border.But still watching via reconnaissance drones close to the border, are the Ukrainian recruits. ""I´ll always remember that night in Chernobyl,"" says Vladyslav. ""When I went out to smoke with my friend. But by the time I´d finished my cigarette the war had started.""My friend and I have this dream, that we will go on shift, just like we did that day, and as we smoke another cigarette we will hear that the war has ended. And that we won.""Special thanks to Slava Shramovych, Marcus Buckley, Michael Whelan, Alastair Thompson, Ben Allen and Tim Coey.

Ukrainian authorities believe 300 people were killed but an Associated Press investigation said the number was closer to 600. Many of the bodies were found in the basement.Amnesty International said it was a war crime carried out by Russian forces and the international monitoring group OSCE said it had not received any indication to back up Russian allegations that a Ukrainian battalion had blown up the theatre.Prosecutors said Maria Ponomarenko had committed a criminal offence brought in within days of the invasion of spreading ""knowingly false information"" about the Russian armed forces.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Residents had written the Russian word for ""children"" outside the theatre in an attempt to stop Russian airstrikesAddressing the court ahead of her sentence she stressed that under Russia´s constitution she had done nothing wrong: ""Had I committed a real crime then it would be possible to ask for leniency, but again, due to my moral and ethical qualities, I would not do this.""Declaring herself a patriotic, opposition pacifist, she ended her address by saying: ""No totalitarian regime has ever been as strong as before its collapse.""The journalist and activist, who has two young children, has suffered mental health problems in jail, according to her lawyer, and last year compared her conditions in pre-trial detention to torture.Last summer, Moscow councillor Alexei Gorinov was jailed for seven years after he was filmed speaking out against Russia´s war in Ukraine in a city council meeting. Earlier this week a UN working group called for his release, concluding that his detention was arbitrary and contravened the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.In December one of Russia´s most prominent opposition figures, Ilya Yashin, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years for spreading ""fake news"" about the military after he went on YouTube to condemn the killing of hundreds of Ukrainian civilians by Russian occupying forces in Bucha, near Kyiv.

It´s become President Putin´s watchword.And we saw more of it today.""Russia suspends its participation in the New Start treaty,"" announced the Kremlin leader in his state of the nation address. As usual he blamed the West.New Start is the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America. It limits the nuclear arsenals of the two countries. But there was more. The Russian president announced that he had signed a decree on ""putting new ground-based strategic complexes on combat standby duty"". He warned that Russia was ready to resume nuclear weapons testing.""Of course, we will not do it first,"" President Putin added. ""But if the US conducts tests, we will do it as well.""New Start had been in trouble. Last month Washington had accused Moscow of violating the agreement by refusing to allow inspection activities on its territory. Moscow´s suspension of its participation in the treaty raises the stakes.""This is more about nuclear blackmail, but it is extremely dangerous,"" believes Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""because we cannot predict how Putin will behave in the future and what is in his mind.""In order to avoid nuclear war, it´s better to have a framework,"" he added.""By losing this framework we are witnessing the real threat of a nuclear war.""What is the New Start treaty?Image source, AFPImage caption, A Russian RS-24 Yars strategic nuclear missileSigned in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.Each side´s limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world´s nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.We´re also witnessing a Kremlin leader who expresses no remorse or regret for his decision to invade Ukraine. His ""special military operation"" has not gone at all according to plan, bringing misery to Ukraine, heavy military casualties for Russia and forcing President Putin to draft hundreds of thousands of Russians into the army. So, was the invasion a huge mistake? A giant miscalculation? You won´t hear Putin admit to one of those. He continues to push the false narrative that the West is to blame for the war.""I want to repeat,"" he said. ""They [the West] started the war. And we used force and are using force to stop it.""""The Western elites do not conceal their goals to bring Russia a strategic defeat. What does it mean? It means to end us, once and for all. It means they plan to turn a local conflict into a global confrontation. We understand it exactly like that. We will react to it accordingly. This is because in this case it is about the very existence of our country."" President Putin exuded confidence that Russia could survive international sanctions and - despite Western support for Ukraine - emerge victorious. No hint of compromise. No sign he´s looking for an off-ramp.""He thinks he has reserves for continuing the war and confrontation. It´s a bad sign,"" Mr Kolesnikov concludes."" He has disrupted any connection with Western countries. He is not ready to finish this disaster right now. He will continue.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64720695,21,2,2023,"['nuclear', 'putin', 'russia', 'war', 'ukraine', 'start', 'treaty', 'president', 'weapons', 'strategic', 'annual', 'ready', 'west', 'force', 'western', 'promotes', 'escalation', 'resume', 'state', 'nation']",0.3256946285007509,0.023037591660040643,21/2/2023

""This is probably a result of the Russian command continuing to insist on offensive action largely consisting of dismounted infantry, with less support from artillery fire because Russia is short of munitions.""The BBC has been unable to independently verify these reports. The ministry did not give information on where such battles were taking place.Analysts say that although there is indeed an ammunition shortage, the situation is more complex than the intelligence update suggests, with Russian forces still using twice as much ammunition as the Ukrainian side.Is Russia’s stock of weapons running low?Meanwhile Russian forces appear to have secured a sufficient positional advantage in the besieged city of Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said.Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take control of the small city, where around 4,000 civilians remain. Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia, but the city´s strategic value has been questioned.The ISW said Russia´s positional advantage could allow a ""turning movement"" in the city. The purpose of a turning movement is to force the enemy to abandon prepared defensive positions, and is different from the aim of an encirclement, which is to trap and destroy enemy forces, the ISW says. ""The Russians may have intended to encircle Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, but the Ukrainian command has signalled that it will likely withdraw rather than risk an encirclement,"" the ISW said.However, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday that it had no intention of withdrawing from Bakhmut.A statement by the Armed Forces General Staff acknowledged that Russian forces were still trying to surround the city, but said more than 100 attacks had been repelled in the eastern Donbas region in the past 24 hours. Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64855760,6,3,2023,"['ministry', 'russia', 'forces', 'city', 'ukraine', 'war', 'reservists', 'ukrainian', 'bakhmut', 'fighting', 'shovels', 'defence', 'isw', 'mpl', 'ammunition', 'update', 'mythologised', 'stock', 'hand', 'combat']",0.32220376522702104,-0.0013150609080841643,6/3/2023

The United States now says Beijing is considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, allegations which China strongly denies.Is China providing Russia with weapons?China has been expanding its military production capabilities and is now the world´s fourth largest arms exporter.""China´s weapons are getting more advanced now,"" says Siemon Wezeman from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. ""Its drones, for example, are one area that Russia would be very interested in.""The US says Chinese firms have already provided ""non-lethal support"" to Russia, and that it has new information suggesting Beijing could soon provide ""lethal support"".Maria Shagina, an expert in economic sanctions at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, says China has not overtly supplied Russia with weapons but may be secretly selling it hi-tech products which could be used for military purposes.""There is evidence that China is the biggest exporter of semiconductors - often through shell companies in Hong Kong and the UAE - to Russia,"" she says.""Some Chinese companies are also supplying civilian drones, exploiting the grey space between military and civilian purposes.""The US-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies says Chinese companies may be sending Russia electronic parts for anti-aircraft missile radars. The US has also imposed sanctions on a Chinese company which Washington says has provided satellite imagery in support of Russian mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine. US sanctions Chinese firm helping Russia´s WagnerWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Russia´s most important trading partnerAfter Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Western nations imposed strict sanctions on Russia - banning imports of oil and exports of hi-tech products.Many Western firms cut their connections with Russia entirely, and its trade with the US, UK, and EU countries slumped over the course of 2022.However, China´s overall trade with Russia hit a record high level of $190bn in 2022 - a 30% increase on the year before.Russian imports from China increased 13% to $76bn and its exports to China increased by 43% to $114bn.As Russia´s trade with Western countries plunged in 2022, China became, by far and away, its most important trading partner.How much oil and gas is China buying from Russia?  Almost half of all the Russian government´s annual revenues come from oil and gas, and its sales to EU countries has plummeted over the past year as sanctions bite.  A significant amount of this shortfall has been made up with increased sales to Asia.Who is buying Russian oil and gasRussia exported twice as much liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to China in 2022 than it did the year before. It also delivered 50% more natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline, and 10% more crude oil. The G7 group of economically developed countries, along with the European Union and Australia, has tried to impose a worldwide cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea, but China has refused to comply and buys Russian crude at market prices.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s terminal in Tianjin receives liquified natural gas from RussiaThere are also longer term plans to expand energy ties. The two countries have agreed to build a new gas pipeline (the Power of Siberia 2).

The pair face money laundering and conspiracy charges. Mr McGonigal also faces charges he took $225,000 (£181,612) in cash from a foreign agent while still in the FBI. He is one of the highest-ranking FBI agents to ever be charged with a crime. Mr McGonigal was arrested on Saturday after returning to JFK International Airport in New York from international travel, and on Monday entered a plea of not guilty at a federal courthouse in Manhattan.According to federal prosecutors, the 54-year-old Mr McGonigal  - who was in charge of FBI counterintelligence in New York before his retirement in 2018 - and former Russian diplomat Sergey Shestakov violated US sanctions by agreeing to provide services to Russian billionaire and industrialist Oleg Deripaska. Mr Deripaska, 55, is reportedly once Russia´s richest man and was president of energy company En+ Group and United Company Rusal - the world´s second largest aluminium company - before leaving both firms in 2018. He was hit with sanctions the same year, with the US accusing him and a handful of other Russian oligarchs and officials of ""malign activity around the globe"".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Charles McGonigal stands accused of working on behalf of oligarch Oleg Deripaska, seen here.US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Monday that Mr McGonigal and Mr Shestakov ""both previously worked with Deripaska to attempt to have his sanctions removed"". ""As public servants, they should have known better.""Prosecutors believe the two men agreed to investigate a rival oligarch and have Mr Deripaska removed from a list of individuals sanctioned by the US.The men and an associate of Mr Deripaska are accusing of ""using shell companies as counterparties in the contract that outlined the services to be performed, using a forged signature on that contract, and using the same shell companies to send and receive payments from Deripaska"", prosecutors allege. Mr McGonigal faces separate charges that he took cash while still serving in the FBI ""from an individual who had business interests in Europe and who had been an employee of a foreign intelligence service"".Prosecutors did not name the individual but describe the person as a former ""foreign security officer and businessperson"" with interests abroad. Mr McGonigal and Mr Shestakovnow face four sanctions-related and money laundering charges, each of which carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. Mr Shestakov also faces charges that he made false statements, punishable by another five years. In the separate charges, Mr McGonigal faces six counts of false statements - each punishable by five years - as well as two counts of falsification of records and documents, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years.

He said the UNHCR would try to get access to those affected and try to find solutions in their best interest.However, Mr Grandi admitted he did not know how many children were affected. ""In the situation of war, you cannot determine if children have families or guardianship. And therefore, until that is clarified, you cannot give them another nationality or having them adopted by another family,"" Mr Grandi said.According to the most recent UNHCR data, nearly three million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded in Russia - more than in any other European country. It is unclear how many of these are children. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said earlier this month almost 14,000 children had been ""deported"" to Russia from occupied parts of Ukraine, and accused it of kidnapping them. The Kremlin has denied the allegations.  Mr Grandi has said the UNHCR is seeking access to Russia ""all the time"" but that so far this has been ""rare, sporadic and not unfettered"".His comments come after the United Nations´ top rights official expressed concern in July that Ukrainian children had been taken from orphanages in the eastern Donbas region and ""forcibly deported"" to Russia. There was also concern Moscow was ""modifying existing legislation"" to fast-track this process. Michelle Bachelet said at the time that she could not confirm the allegations or the number of children potentially affected. Then in September, the assistant UN secretary-general for human rights said there were ""credible allegations"" of ""forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian occupied territory, or to the Russian Federation itself"".Mr Grandi was speaking at the end of a six-day visit to Ukraine and told local residents that ""the whole world admires you because you are strong people.""He said it was possible more refugees could return to Ukraine in the summer, as happened last year, but warned that more fighting could lead to greater displacement, especially internally.Mr Grandi also painted a bleak global outlook when it came to refugees - predicting the number of displaced people would ""almost inevitably"" grow from the current figure of around 103 million in the coming years.Related TopicsRussiaRefugees and asylum seekersUkraineUkrainian refugees",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64429377,27,1,2023,"['children', 'russia', 'grandi', 'ukraine', 'refugees', 'child', 'war', 'protection', 'unhcr', 'affected', 'allegations', 'accuses', 'breaking', 'rules', 'filippo', 'day', 'visit', 'united', 'nations', 'accused']",0.4664285714285714,0.16023809523809526,27/1/2023

His school friends are scattered across the globe and he is living in one room in a Scottish hotel with his mother Oléna Bólotova.The hotel has been their home for eight months.Image source, Oléna BólotovaDad Oleksii is still at home in Kharkiv, northeast Ukraine, as are Oléna´s parents.Oléna told BBC Scotland everything changed overnight.""No one expected that one morning they had to wake up, bring all they have in one small backpack and run away,"" she said.""Kharkiv is 36km (22 miles) from the Russian border. The full invasion happened at 05:00 on 24 February 2022 and we had to flee to escape the war.""We tried to settle in different regions of Ukraine - but it wasn´t easy and there are no safe places in Ukraine right now - there are no schools, electricity problems, we were scared about winter.

""I had my husband, a family, a job, a house a dog, and a lot of plans for our future lives. ""We were adult people with strong ideas of our future and how to raise our child in Ukraine.

""My husband is in Ukraine - he cannot join us. We have been married almost 18 years and this is the first time in our life we separated.""Men are trying to live a new reality without wives and children.""Now 13, Yároslav enjoys school in Glasgow and he has joined a football team.

Oléna tries to speak to her parents every day but worries about them.Her biggest hope is to see in the news that the war is over. But for now, they would like more permanent accommodation. Oléna is grateful she feels safe but she would like to cook her son a meal, do her own laundry and to have their own space.A university lecturer and academic in Ukraine, Oléna has started a job at a city university doing admin.""I am happy that I can bring something here and become a tax payer here. I feel like a real part of this Glasgow community,"" she added.Until the mother and son can return to Ukraine, they say they will be brave - a word Oléna said was used a lot to describe Ukrainians. ""Not only for the soldiers who fight on the front line, but for every Ukrainian woman who takes her children and tries to look around the world for a safe place to raise them,"" she said.""Brave for teachers and doctors who stay in Ukraine and help people.

We´re sitting in his kitchen, a rainbow flag adorning the wall.Danya´s act is horror-themed - think Halloween meets drag. The 22-year-old regularly performed at a queer club night in St Petersburg called Gender Blender. But the project has now cancelled its shows after a new anti-LGBT law was passed by the Russian Parliament in December. Danya´s work has all but dried up.""According to the law, it´s forbidden to do what we´re doing,"" Danya says. ""We´re a lot more anxious now. The risks are much higher.""The new law bans ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations"" amongst all age groups. Anyone caught committing this ""offence"" could be fined up to 400,000 roubles ($5,840; £4,730), with much higher fines for organisations or journalists.Since the law was passed, Danya has decided to leave Russia and move to France. He says that living in a country where it´s illegal to ""just be yourself"" makes him feel afraid. ""My hands are tied. I just don´t have a choice anymore. Either I leave the country, or stay here and wait for it to get even worse. What´s happening now - it´s very frightening.""Image caption, Danya says his performances are loved by audiences in St Petersburg´s clubsThe bill began its journey through the Russian legislative system last summer, shortly after Moscow launched its so-called special military operation. The timing is no accident: Vladimir Putin says that Russia is not only fighting Ukraine on the battlefield, but also ""Western"" values. During a speech in the Kremlin to mark the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the president lashed out at the West and LGBT rights, calling them ""pure Satanism"".LGBT activist Piotr Voskresensky says the link to the war in Ukraine is ""obvious"". In his flat in central St Petersburg, he shows me the exhibits from his short-lived LGBT museum - Russia´s first. He opened the exhibition to the public in September last year but had to close it again once the new law passed. He says the law is an attempt by the Kremlin to divert the public´s attention away from setbacks on the battlefield. ""The war is lost, the economy is destroyed, and the authorities need to show people what they have risked their lives for,"" says Piotr. ""And the best idea they have is to find a new scapegoat - LGBT people.""Image caption, Piotr Voskresensky´s flat is full of exhibits from his now-closed LGBT museumThis is not the first law to place restrictions on Russia´s queer community. Ten years ago, a bill was passed banning so-called ""gay propaganda"" in relation to children. Human rights groups say that it was followed by a rise in violent homophobic attacks in Russia. Olga Baranova, from Moscow Community Centre for LGBT+ Initiatives, told me that the new law will further stigmatise LGBT people. ""We will go fully underground, there will be fictitious marriages, fictitious families. The privileged ones will leave the country. Those that can´t leave the country will go underground and look for partners somehow - using closed channels.""The worry now amongst the LGBT community is how, when and against whom the law will be applied. Russian legislation is notoriously vague, giving the authorities a blunt instrument that can be applied arbitrarily. But the fear generated by the legislation is already leading to censorship: online cinemas have deleted LGBT-themed films and TV series and edited out gay scenes. In one episode of the highly-acclaimed HBO series The White Lotus, a Russian streaming service changed the word ""gay"" to ""man"", edited in a towel onto one male character´s bare backside and deleted a gay sex scene, just days after the law was adopted.Image caption, The book Shattered, about the romance between two men, has been heavily redacted in RussiaBooks, too, are being censored. Shops across the country have withdrawn titles with LGBT themes and characters from sale. In one St Petersburg bookshop, I find a recently-released title, Shattered - a tale of romance between two men. As the book is wrapped in plastic, I must buy it to look inside. The text has been redacted by the publisher, with whole sections replaced with black lines.One of the co-authors of the law, an openly homophobic nationalist called Vitaly Milonov, agrees to speak to me via videolink. He is allegedly in the city of Horlivka in occupied eastern Ukraine, having travelled to the frontline as a volunteer fighter. He dismisses accusations that the law is discriminatory, saying people´s private lives will be respected. At a time when thousands are dying in Ukraine, Russia is isolated internationally and people are fleeing this country, I ask him whether it´s appropriate to be focussing on an LGBT law. ""Russia is not being isolated, we have a conflict with the Western world!"" Mr Milonov says. ""Why should you point at us that we have the wrong ideology? I think it is our sovereign right to have legislation that we like to have.""Back in Danya´s flat, he shows me some of the costumes he has lovingly designed for his drag act. The audiences in the St Petersburg clubs love his alternative performance, he says. He doesn´t want to leave this country. ""In what kind of a Russia can you imagine wanting to live?"" I ask him. ""A free Russia,"" he tells me, thinking about the question carefully. ""One that doesn´t undermine the most basic human rights that every person should have. Because I think my orientation is my right from birth, and no-one has the right to cancel, ban it, or prosecute me for it.""Produced by Liza ShuvalovaRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warHuman rights in RussiaRussiaSt PetersburgLGBTVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64345693,23,1,2023,"['lgbt', 'law', 'russia', 'danya', 'country', 'ukraine', 'leave', 'st', 'petersburg', 'passed', 'putin', 'kremlin', 'called', 'rights', 'gay', 'drag', 'shows', 'image', 'piotr', 'flat']",0.41813664555141816,0.06455504722550177,23/1/2023

In a traditional military sense, it´s when armies look to generate momentum after using the poor winter conditions to replenish. It is true that the fighting has become more static during typically cold conditions. However, all signs seem to be pointing towards an upcoming Russian push. Moscow has mobilised hundreds of thousands more men, as well as increased its production of weapons and ammunition. Kyiv is expecting to see major attacks from the east and south as soon as 24 February, which would mark a year since the full-scale invasion. So, if Russia does launch another offensive, what will it try to take?BakhmutImage source, EPAImage caption, Bakhmut has been virtually flattened during months of heavy fightingIt´s the eastern city which has been grabbing the headlines because of the endless conflicting claims over who controls it. For now, Kyiv isn´t hinting at a tactical retreat. It claims the Russians are suffering about 500 casualties per day as they stage relentless attacks. Ukraine reckons its own losses are not as high.Regular Russian forces appear to have replaced mercenaries from the Wagner Group as they continue to surround the city. For now, Ukrainian troops are continuing to hold it. If or when the city falls, invading forces are expected to push towards the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. It could allow Moscow to capture the entire eastern Donetsk region, one of its official goals. But that would involve capturing more than 4,000 square miles (10,360 sq km). In a period where Russia has been making minimal, costly gains, the Ukrainians would have to be seriously overpowered, or taken by surprise. VuhledarImage source, ReutersImage caption, Vuhledar is now a ghost town as almost all residents have fled the townAfter trying and failing last November, Russian forces have started launching attacks on the small town of Vuhledar, also in the Donetsk region.It sits on the south-eastern curve of the current battlefield and is significant for Moscow for two reasons. Firstly, it´s close to the only rail line linking the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russian-controlled territories in the east. It´s from Vuhledar that Ukrainian forces have been firing artillery at Russian supply trains. Vuhledar is like Bakhmut in that for the Russians it carries more symbolic than military significance. Ukraine is convinced Moscow is going to chase its two main goals as quickly as possible. Alongside capturing the whole of Donbas (Luhansk and Donetsk regions), Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought to be looking to widen the land corridor he has seized between Crimea and Russia. The capture of Vuhledar would certainly go towards those - but it would be more valuable to the Kremlin in a propaganda sense. Military milestones help the Kremlin to justify its ""special military operation"" back in Russia, as well as appease critics. They also could provide President Putin with a political way out, if he can keep hold of what he seizes. ZaporizhzhiaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Zaporizhzhia - which has been regularly shelled by Russia - is seen as a gateway to the south of UkraineAway from the eastern front, the conflict line south of the city Zaporizhzhia is another direction Kyiv is worried about. The concern is that Russian forces could push north towards the towns of Orikhiv and Pokrovsk (the latter is in Donetsk region). If this were to happen, it would push back the firing positions of longer-range Ukrainian missiles which can strike deep into the land corridor Russia controls further south. Given that American HIMARS have been able to travel up to 80km (50 miles), and are about to go up to 120km, the occupied cities of Melitopol and Tokmak are comfortably within Ukraine´s range. Moscow is also wary of a Ukrainian advance here too towards Melitopol. Kyiv has talked about the importance of the city before, saying its liberation would allow Ukraine to cut off Russian supply routes to Crimea. However, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, the Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine´s Armed Forces, has also admitted his troops don´t have the numbers of equipment for such an attack.KharkivThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Building hit by missile in Kharkiv´s Freedom SquareDespite being less than 25 miles from the border with Russia, Ukraine´s second largest city in the north-east has never fallen into Moscow´s control. Like so many areas, it has been mostly torn apart from Russia´s attempts to snatch it from Kyiv´s control. Kharkiv´s population has endured almost constant missile strikes and resulting blackouts throughout this winter. Authorities say while there hasn´t been an increase in nearby enemy forces, Russians have been shelling civilian areas more frequently. Some officers in the local military have said they ""wouldn´t be surprised"" if the Russians launched another attack, especially with the frozen ground.While there is no guarantee Russia could take a city it has failed to penetrate over the past year, its capture would bring a significant strategic advantage. Invading forces could seal the city off from Kyiv, which could prevent Ukrainian troops currently south of Kharkiv from retreating to the capital.KyivImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Early in the full-scale invasion Russian troops got within several kilometres of Kyiv, but were driven back by Ukrainian troopsUkraine´s capital is still Russia´s ultimate prize. However, this isn´t 2022. Last year, joint military exercises between Belarus and Russia turned into an advance on Kyiv when Moscow used its ally as a launchpad for its invasion. At the start of this year there were fears of history repeating itself when both countries announced drills once more - this time in the form of ""defensive"" air force exercises north of Ukraine. Belarus denied it had plans to join the invasion. Moscow rejected claims it had tried to force it. Now, both the West and Ukraine seem to agree on there being no intelligence suggesting the capital could be under the threat it faced last year. Plus, Russia used its best-trained forces during its first attempt, when its goal was to topple the Ukrainian government. ""We do not see formed assault groups capable of reaching Kyiv,"" said Ukraine´s outgoing Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov.""Besides, it is impossible to capture Kyiv in principle. It is a large city with four million people, ready to defend themselves.""If Russia indeed launches a large-scale offensive and gains momentum, Mr Reznikov´s successor could give a different assessment.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivZaporizhzhiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64533495,6,2,2023,"['russia', 'ukraine', 'kyiv', 'ukrainian', 'city', 'forces', 'moscow', 'military', 'south', 'vuhledar', 'cities', 'offensive', 'push', 'invasion', 'eastern', 'russians', 'troops', 'capture', 'donetsk', 'bakhmut']",0.4099427392530842,0.05601395730706075,6/2/2023

Since the fighting began, some 90% of its pre-invasion population has fled.This small administrative city in the Donbas is a wasteland of shattered buildings and trees. Even if it falls to Russia - something that could still take time and is not guaranteed - Moscow will, Western officials say, have gained little and lost much.For Ukraine, one official said, the battle for Bakhmut has been ""a unique opportunity to kill a lot of Russians"".Ukraine´s military has also paid a heavy price, although Western officials reject figures cited on Tuesday by Russia´s defence minister.In a statement to a defence meeting, posted on Telegram, Sergei Shoigu said Ukraine had lost 11,000 troops in February alone. ""The Kyiv regime´s indifference towards its own people is astonishing,"" Mr Shoigu claimed, perhaps deliberately flipping Ukraine´s criticism of Moscow´s own human-wave tactics on its head.Western officials say they ""don´t recognise"" Mr Shoigu´s figures. By contrast, they believe the Wagner mercenary group, which has led Russia´s attempt to capture Bakhmut, is running short of manpower and equipment.In the latest in a series of broadsides against the Russian military, Wagner´s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin accused the Russian military of failing to supply the ammunition Wagner needs to take the city. This, Prigozhin argued, was the result of ""ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal"".Whatever happens to Bakhmut - one official said he thought the Russian effort was ""stalling"" - there´s a clear hope among Ukraine´s allies that the battle has wrecked Moscow´s chances of making any further meaningful headway in the near future.One Western official dismissed the battle for Bakhmut as ""quite a small tactical event"" which held no strategic significance ""for either side"".In his remarks posted on Telegram, Sergei Shoigu said the ""liberation of Artyomovsk [the Russian name for Bakhmut] continues,"" and he suggested that it would represent a breakthrough.""The city is an important defensive hub for Ukrainian forces in the Donbas,"" he said. ""Taking control of it will allow… further offensive actions into the Ukrainian military´s defensive lines.""But Western officials said there was currently no sign of any wider Russian offensive. The general in charge of Moscow´s war effort, Valery Gerasimov, they said, was ""under pressure"".""It´s hard to see how he´s going… to regain the initiative,"" This isn´t the first time Kyiv´s Western backers have suggested that Moscow´s campaign has come unstuck. Similar claims were made following Ukraine´s lightning counter-offensives last autumn.But Russia´s territorial gains over the winter have been extremely modest.Meanwhile, Ukraine has been receiving fresh batches of Western military equipment, including tanks and other armoured vehicles, and laying plans for its own offensive, which could come as early as May.

While there has been some targeting of power facilities in recent weeks, this has been the longest gap since the attacks began in early October. A much-anticipated wave of strikes to mark the first anniversary of Russia´s full scale invasion on 24 February failed to materialise - though this probably said more about media expectations than Russia´s actual strategy. But the increasingly sporadic nature of Russia´s infrastructure attacks is notable.Western officials believe this indicates a shortage of the kind of precision-guided weaponry - especially missiles - needed to carry out such attacks with any measure of effectiveness. ""It takes them that long to get a number of precision weapons together before they can mount a packaged event strike,"" was how one official put it earlier this week. Ukraine´s military has also become quite adept at intercepting incoming missiles and drones.Preliminary data suggests that a significant proportion of the weapons used today were shot down, including more than 70% of the cruise missiles and half the drones. According to Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, another eight missiles were thwarted by what he described as ""organized countermeasures"".But clearly, judging by reports from all over the country, others found their mark. Image source, EPAImage caption, Locals gather around a shelling crater after a rocket hit the Pisochyn neighbourhood outside KharkivSome weapons, like the long range Kh-22 anti-ship missile, which dives steeply onto its target from an extremely high altitude, are hard to intercept. The same goes for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile, which was never designed to attack targets on the ground but which has been increasingly used in this role over the course of the past six months. Military analysts will pore over the latest data, looking for what Russia´s choice of weapons indicates about Moscow´s tactics and remaining stocks. Before today´s attacks, observers had begun to wonder whether Russia would persist with a strategy that doesn´t appear to be working.Ukraine in maps: Russia launches new missile attacksUkraine nuclear plant loses power after strikesDespite the enormous damage inflicted on Ukraine´s power grid over the past six months, the country has not been brought to its knees and most Ukrainians have long since become accustomed to power cuts, inconvenience and the occasional danger.  Ukraine´s engineers have successfully kept power flowing across the country, despite losing scores of transformers, switches and other key components of the country´s infrastructure.In Kyiv and other cities, street lights have recently been switched back on, offering relief to pedestrians used to making their way along darkened pavements with only their mobile phones to light the way.But the situation remains precarious and officials know that Russia is still able to cause immense damage.

Buildings and infrastructure were hit in Kharkiv and Odesa, with power blackouts in several areas. Attacks on the capital Kyiv are also reported.Ukraine said Russia fired 81 missiles, in what is the biggest strike in weeks.The military claimed it successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the eight Iranian-made Shahed drones which were fired.The attacks mark the biggest day of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine since the end of January, when 11 people died after dozens of buildings were struck in several regions. In Thursday´s attacks, at least five people were killed in Lviv in western Ukraine, after a rocket hit their home, the region´s governor Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram.Russian shelling killed three people in the southern city of Kherson, where a public transport stop was hit, Ukraine´s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said.While one person died and two others were injured following drone and missile strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to governor Serhii Lysak.How risky is stand-off over Ukraine´s nuclear plant?Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said a strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant meant the ""last link"" between the facility and the Ukrainian power system was cut off. For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility is now operating on diesel generators, which have enough supplies to last at least 10 days.The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was ""astonished by the complacency"" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.""Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,"" Rafael Grossi said.Russia-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine´s Zaporizhzhia region said the halt in electricity supplies to the power station from Ukrainian-held territory was ""a provocation"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was ""a difficult night"", after Russia resumed its ""wretched tactics"".He said energy systems were being restored and all services were working after the ""massive"" rocket attack struck critical infrastructure and residential buildings.In Kyiv, emergency services are at the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.Mr Klitschko said cars were burning in the courtyard of one residential building and he urged people to stay in shelters. Much of the city has been left without electricity, with four in 10 people without power, he added.Image source, ReutersImage caption, People gathered outside a residential building in Kyiv following the strikesA mass missile attack struck an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported, he added.""About 15"" strikes hit Kharkiv city and region, with ""critical infrastructure facilities"" and a residential building targeted, regional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said.Other regions hit include Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west, and Dnipro and Poltava in the centre of the country.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion just over a year ago. Since then tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured and millions of Ukrainians became refugees.The US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, suggested on Wednesday that President Putin might be planning to drag out the war for years but that Russia was not strong enough to launch major new offensives this year.She said the war in Ukraine had become a ""grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage"".""We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and that prolonging the war including with potential pauses in the fighting may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia´s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,"" she said.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Emergency workers attended burning cars damaged by the Russian missile strikes in KyivMs Haines said Russia might turn to defending the territories it now occupies, adding that it would need additional ""mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources"" to sustain even its level of operations in Ukraine.Ukraine´s military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.Why Bakhmut matters for Russia and Ukraine ""The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,"" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. ""Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.""Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.

David Smith, 58, tried to damage Britain´s interests by passing on details of the embassy and its staff for cash payments, a judge found after the spy pleaded guilty.Sentencing him, Mr Justice Wall said Smith had ""put people at maximum risk"". UK police have described Smith´s actions as ""reckless and dangerous"".They have revealed how the spy was caught in a ""remarkable"" investigation involving two fake Russian agents working for the British security services. Major investigationSmith, formerly with the RAF, had been employed as a security guard at the embassy in Berlin for four years when, in 2020, he wrote to a Russian general passing on the names, addresses and phone numbers of colleagues, along with documents and information about security passes. He had been collecting classified documents since 2018, motivated by his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and hatred of the UK, the judge found. The letter ended up in the hands of the Metropolitan Police and MI5, triggering a major investigation which also involved German law enforcement. In August 2021, to gather additional evidence, Smith was told a man with the Russian name Dmitry was to visit the embassy, and he was asked to arrange for him to pass through security. ""Oh it´s one of those,"" Smith reportedly responded. He seemed to believe Dmitry was a Russian ""walk-in"", intent on passing secrets to Britain. In his sentencing remarks, the judge said Smith had done as much as he could to ""ensure that Dmitry´s identity could be revealed"". Had Dmitry´s story been genuine ""it is impossible to know what would have been the consequences to him"", the judge said.

These had been marked with a pink highlighter to identify them. Dmitry also asked Smith to throw away some packaging from a mobile phone Sim card he had been given.It was all a ruse. Dimitry was an MI5-trained ""role player"" and ""Smith fell for it"", Cdr Richard Smith of the Metropolitan Police told the BBC. The documents with the pink markings, which were not remotely secret, were later found at Smith´s home, along with the Sim card packaging. Investigators had also placed a covert camera in the room where Smith worked, monitoring CCTV images.

He could be heard muttering to himself that if Dmitry worked at the Russian embassy, staff there would know who he was.  ""It´s probably nothing but at least I´ve done it,"" he was recorded as saying.Next, MI5 arranged for ""Irina"", another Russian speaker, to approach Smith at a tram stop posing as an officer of the GRU, Russian military intelligence. Her story, also false, was that she had been sent from Moscow to ask him for help because someone was passing information to the British. Again, Smith fell for it, arranging a meeting with Irina the following day. Video seizedAfter his arrest, his flat in Potsdam was searched, and among the items found was a piece of paper with the email address of the Russian embassy. Video was seized of Smith walking around the British embassy, meticulously filming offices, safes, the insides of drawers and a whiteboard recording details of staff deployments. Smith had also photographed communications equipment. A letter to a Russian colonel offering to send a ""book from the defence section"" classified as ""official-sensitive"" was found on a storage device.Police also found images of a letter from two secretaries of state to then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Cdr Smith said: ""The activities he was conducting and the information he was seeking to gain did raise a significant risk to UK interests and individuals.""A consular official said that as a result of Smith´s actions, a security review had to be carried out for every member of embassy staff costing the taxpayer £825,000. Image source, Social MediaSmith admitted eight charges under the Official Secrets Act and was sentenced after a hearing to determine why he did it.The spy was a keen military historian, whose Ukrainian wife had left Germany for her home country, because she did not like living there. Smith appeared to share this view, colleagues at the embassy told police. He had also told fake Russian intelligence officer Irina that Germany was dominated by Nazis.Conspiracy theoriesIn his evidence, Smith said he became depressed and was drinking heavily after his wife returned to Ukraine. He was also angry at his employer, complaining he had to go to work every day during the pandemic when ""everyone was sitting at home with full pay"".He admitted being interested in conspiracy theories, including those of David Icke and Alex Jones´s Infowars, but denied being pro-Russian or having far right sympathies. However, the prosecution highlighted his collection of Russian military memorabilia, as well as his past support for Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Inside his work locker was a cartoon of Mr Putin with his hands around the neck of former German chancellor Angela Merkel in Nazi uniform.  Cdr Smith said the spy was ""motivated by anti-UK, pro-Russian views, he understood that the info he was collecting was damaging to British interests, and yet he shared it with the Russians anyway"".An MI5 officer gave evidence that Smith´s spying coincided with the build-up of Russian forces before the war in Ukraine and the concerns about the treatment of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. The resulting risks could not ""be sensibly described as theoretical"", the MI5 staffer told the court, using the code name 2093. Smith was arrested with 800 euros (£713) in cash, and police analysed his bank accounts which showed he was not withdrawing his salary, suggesting had another source of income. The amount of money he was paid may never be known. Senior police officers would not say how much information Russia could have received from the spy.

But the growing number of casualties and extrajudicial executions make it much harder to find volunteers, even in prisons. Many convicts are now worried that they can be simply forced to go to war - and migrant workers from Central Asian countries find themselves particularly vulnerable.Anuar came to Russia in search of work in 2018. He was later imprisoned for drug trafficking and sent to serve his term at Penal Colony Number Six in Vladimir region. The BBC is not disclosing his real name and citizenship for safety reasons.  At the end of January, he told his father that a group of Central Asians had been sent to fight in Ukraine without their consent. ""There are lots of Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kyrgyz there in that prison. Now they are planning to send another group and my son is worried that they will force him to go too,"" Anuar´s father told the BBC.   The BBC has seen court documents and Anuar´s letters which confirm he is indeed serving his sentence in that prison. And his story about the group that was forced to go to Ukraine in January is also corroborated by Olga Romanova, director of the civil rights organisation Russia Behind Bars. Parents of those prisoners approached her for help.  ""They were not given a choice. They were told to sign the contract and were sent to the front line like a bag of potatoes,"" Ms Romanova said.  Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Parents of prisoners have approached Olga Romanova for helpInitially, the parents were willing to go to court so that their children wouldn´t end up in Ukraine, she says. But then they refused to, out of fear of the punishment their children could face if they stayed in prison. Penal Colony Number Six is notorious for its ill-treatment and frequent beatings of convicts. Olga Romanova described it as ""a torture prison"". It´s where Alexei Navalny, the prominent Russian opposition figure, is being held.  The colony´s administration has not replied to the BBC´s request to respond to the allegations that they forced prisoners to sign military contracts.  Recruitment in prisons appears to have been very successful, but things are changing as the Wagner group is suffering heavy losses on the battlefield. BBC Uzbek has spoken to Farukh (not his real name), a citizen of Uzbekistan who is in prison in Russia´s Rostov region. Several of his fellow inmates joined Wagner. First it was voluntary, Farukh said, but now he´s worried that prisoners may be forced to go to war.  ""In the beginning, I also considered going because everyone thought that Russia was more powerful, that Russia would win - maybe in one month, three months or in one year. But now we see how many people are dying there and if they are short of soldiers - it´s not good. If they tell me to go and I refuse, then they can declare that I am against Russia.""  Central Asian citizens are recruited to fight for Russia in other ways too, not just in prisons. Overall, there are about 10.5 million migrants from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia, according to the latest statistics from the Russian Interior Ministry. And that´s a massive resource for military headhunters to tap.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Wagner has reportedly recruited tens of thousands of prisoners to fight in UkraineRussian authorities openly sign up people to join the armed forces at the migration centre in Moscow. There are even ads in Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik languages offering citizens of these countries a fast track to obtain a Russian passport if they join the armed forces.  But activists say that it´s not always voluntary. Migrant rights defender Valentina Chupik told the BBC that police officers sometimes stopped Central Asian migrants on the street and intimidated them into signing a military contract. They were told that otherwise they would get deported, Ms Chupik said.Many labour migrants lack proper work permits, live at a place other than where they´re registered, or violate other migration rules. And that´s why they can be an easy target for recruiters. Aziz, not his real name, who has dual Russian and Tajik citizenship, told the BBC he was detained during a police raid at the construction site where he works. He was told he´d be taken to a police station to check his ID but instead, he ended up at a military enlistment office. When he started shouting at police officers demanding why they had lied to him, they twisted his arms and threw him back into the bus.  Eventually they released him. But many migrants in Russia are too afraid of law enforcement officers to object to being signed up for the war.Related TopicsKazakhstanRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUzbekistanKyrgyzstanVladimir PutinTajikistanUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64582985,14,2,2023,"['russia', 'ukraine', 'war', 'migrants', 'forced', 'fight', 'prisoners', 'group', 'prison', 'wagner', 'central', 'romanova', 'military', 'police', 'getty', 'imagesimage', 'recruited', 'number', 'prisons', 'worried']",0.3506944444444445,0.0481060606060606,14/2/2023

He´s thought to be linked to a German foreign intelligence service (BND) employee who was arrested in December for allegedly spying for Russia.Prosecutors have said Arthur E doesn´t work for the intelligence services.Instead, they believe he passed on information from his acquaintance - the detained BND officer known as Carsten L because of privacy rules - to the Kremlin, making him an alleged accomplice to treason. The alleged double agent was later found guilty of handing over documents to the CIA and Russian intelligence, and sentenced to eight years in prison.His arrest in December was the first time a BND employee had been arrested for suspected treason since Markus Reichel was detained in 2014. Suspected Russian spy held by German intelligenceArthur E arrived back in Germany where he was arrested after travelling from the United States.It comes at a time of increased concerns about Russian espionage in Europe following the invasion of Ukraine last February. Germany´s cybersecurity chief was fired in October after the media accused him of having had links with people involved with Russian intelligence services.The following month, a man was found guilty of passing information to Russian intelligence services while working as a reserve officer for the German army.Related TopicsGermanySpyingRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64415814,26,1,2023,"['intelligence', 'arrested', 'german', 'man', 'allegedly', 'passing', 'russia', 'treason', 'alleged', 'bnd', 'services', 'thought', 'acquaintance', 'foreign', 'service', 'arthur', 'employee', 'information', 'detained', 'officer']",0.14569892473118282,-0.05322580645161291,26/1/2023

Mr Marchenko said ""not a single building"" had remained untouched and that the city is ""almost destroyed"".Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take charge.""There is fighting near the city and there are also street fights,"" Mr Marchenko said. Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia. But despite that, the city´s strategic value has been questioned. Some experts say any Russian victory could be pyrrhic - that is, not worth the cost.Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000. Ukrainian commanders estimate that Russia has lost seven times as many soldiers as they have.On Saturday, UK military intelligence said Russian advances in the northern suburbs had left the Ukraine-held sections vulnerable to Russian attacks on three sides. Mr Marchenko accused the Russians of having ""no goal"" to save the city and that it wanted to commit ""genocide of the Ukrainian people"". ""Currently there is no communication in the city so the city is cut out, the bridges are destroyed and the tactics the Russians are using is the tactic of parched land,"" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.The fall of Bakhmut has long been predicted, but for more than six months it hasn´t happened. So any reports of potential Ukrainian withdrawal should be treated with caution. It is hard to know what is going on without independent sources. Both sides have a greater incentive to confuse their enemy than provide accurate information. But it may be that Ukrainian commanders are beginning to calculate that the cost of defending Bakhmut - in terms of blood and treasure - is now too great, despite the grievous losses being inflicted on Russian troops. And if so, then they might want what Western analysts call ""a controlled fighting withdrawal"" to protect the remaining Ukrainian forces so they can be redeployed. But any withdrawal may be hard fought and could take some time. Earlier this week, Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the situation in the area was becoming ""more and more difficult"" - although the Ukrainian military said it had repelled numerous attacks since Friday. ""I believe we shouldn´t give any inch of our land to the enemy,"" Mr Marchenko said. ""We should protect our land, we should protect our people and we should protect the businesses that are on this land.""The city was ""almost destroyed"", with bridges ruined and communication cut off, Mr Marchenko added.""They want to destroy Bakhmut, they want to destroy the city like they did with Mariupol and Popasna,"" he said, referring to two cities in the east of Ukraine now under Russian control.The Russian military laid siege to the south-eastern port city of Mariupol at the outset of the invasion and took control after three months of artillery bombardment that killed thousands.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A maternity and children´s hospital in Mariupol was hit by a Russian air strike in March 2022Russia claimed the Donbas town of Soledar, about 10km (6.2 miles) from Bakhmut, in January following a long battle with the Ukrainian forces.Soledar, too, was reportedly reduced to a wasteland of flattened buildings and rubble by the time the Ukrainian army retreated.On Friday, President Zelensky stressed that artillery and shells were needed to ""stop Russia"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the country´s latest package included high-precision Himars artillery rockets and howitzers ""which Ukraine is using so effectively"".

The eastern city has seen months of intense fighting, as Wagner and regular Russian troops try to seize it. But Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin says his army´s lack of ammunition could be ""ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal"".Ukraine´s president and military commanders have agreed to strengthen their defence of Bakhmut. Russia has appeared determined to capture the city for months, but many analysts say it has become a symbolic prize in the war and has little strategic value.An apparent rivalry between the mercenaries and the regular Russian army seems to have intensified in recent weeks, and this is not the first time Mr Prigozhin has accused the Russian defence ministry of withholding the ammunition it needs. In a social media post on Sunday, Mr Prigozhin said documents had been signed on 22 February, with ammunition expected to be sent to Bakhmut the next day.But most had not been shipped, he said, before suggesting it could be deliberate.And in a further sign of the rift, on Monday Mr Prigozhin said his representative was unable to access the headquarters of Russia´s military command. It is unclear where the headquarters is located. Mr Prigozhin said it came after he wrote to the chief of Russia´s ""special military operation"", Valery Gerasimov, about the ""urgent necessity to give us ammunition"".Separately, in a video uploaded on Saturday - but seemingly filmed in February - Mr Prigozhin said his men feared that they were being ""set up"" as scapegoats in case Russia lost its war in Ukraine. ""If we step back, we will go down in history as the people who took the main step to lose the war,"" he said.""And this is precisely the problem with the shell hunger [ammunition shortage]. This is not my opinion, but that of ordinary fighters... ""What if they [the Russian authorities] want to set us up, saying that we are scoundrels - and that´s why they are not giving us ammunition, not giving us weapons, and not letting us replenish our personnel, including [recruiting] prisoners?""In Saturday´s video, Mr Prigozhin also said Russia´s front line would collapse without his troops.He suggested Wagner fighters were taking on the ""entire Ukrainian army... destroying it"" and depriving it of the chance to concentrate on other parts of the front.What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries in Ukraine?Ukraine´s troops were probably conducting a ""limited fighting withdrawal"" in eastern Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Monday. But it added Ukraine was ""continuing to inflict high casualties"" on Russian forces.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country´s military commanders supported continuing operations to defend and strengthen positions in Bakhmut. In a statement, President Zelensky´s office said he had held a meeting with Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine´s armed forces, and Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the country´s ground forces.They spoke ""in favour of continuing the defensive operation and further strengthening our positions in Bakhmut"". On Saturday, the deputy mayor of Bakhmut told the BBC that there was street fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.However Oleksandr Marchenko said Russian troops had not yet gained control.""They have no goal to save the city... their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.Separately, Moscow´s Mr Shoigu has visited the occupied city of Mariupol during a trip to eastern Ukraine - a year after his troops besieged the city. The defence ministry said he was inspecting work carried out to ""restore infrastructure in the Donbas"" - words that are likely to grate in Ukraine, given Russia´s responsibility for the destruction.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64859780,6,3,2023,"['ukraine', 'russia', 'bakhmut', 'wagner', 'prigozhin', 'ammunition', 'war', 'city', 'troops', 'army', 'military', 'ukrainian', 'forces', 'boss', 'betrayal', 'head', 'eastern', 'fighting', 'president', 'defence']",0.3172037583013192,0.009211188540456834,6/3/2023

According to its deputy mayor, Oleksandr Marchenko, there are just a few thousand civilians left living in underground shelters with no water, gas or power. ""The city is almost destroyed,"" he told the BBC. ""There is not a single building that has remained untouched in this war.""So why are Russia and Ukraine fighting so hard over this pile of rubble? Why are both sides laying down the lives of so many of soldiers to attack and defend this city in a battle that has lasted longer than any other in this war? Military analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value. It is not a garrison town or a transport hub or a major centre of population. Before the invasion, there were about 70,000 people living there. The city was best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery. It holds no particular geographic importance. As one Western official put it, Bakhmut is ""one small tactical event on a 1,200-kilometre front line"". And yet Russia is deploying huge military resources into taking the city. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ukraine has suffered many casualties - such as this soldier being buried in Lviv - in its defence of BakhmutThe Kremlin needs a victory, however symbolic. It has been a long time since the summer when Russian forces seized cities like Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Since then what territorial gains they have made have been incremental and slow. So Russia needs a success to sell to pro-Kremlin propagandists back home. Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre, told the BBC: ""They are fighting a political mission, not a purely military one. Russians will continue to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve their political goals.""Russian commanders also want to take Bakhmut for military reasons. They hope it might give them a springboard for further territorial gains. As the UK Ministry of Defence noted in December, capturing the city ""would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk"". And then there is question of the Wagner mercenary group that is at the heart of the assault. Its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. He hoped to show his fighters could do better than the regular Russian army. He has recruited thousands of convicts and is throwing waves of them at Ukrainian defences, many to their deaths. If he cannot succeed here, then his political influence in Moscow will diminish. Mr Prigozhin is at odds with Russia´s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, criticising his tactics and now complaining about not getting enough ammunition. There is, Mr Kuzan said, a political struggle between both men for influence in the Kremlin ""and the place for this struggle is in Bakhmut and its surroundings"". Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Few civilians remain in Bakhmut, which was once home to about 70,000 peopleSo why has Ukraine been defending Bakhmut so doggedly, losing thousands of troops in the process? The main strategic purpose is to use the battle to weaken Russia´s army. One Western official put it bluntly: ""Bakhmut, because of the Russian tactics, is giving Ukraine a unique opportunity to kill a lot of Russians."" Nato sources estimate five Russians are dying for every one Ukrainian in Bakhmut. Ukraine´s national security secretary, Oleksiy Danilov, says the ratio is even higher at seven to one. These numbers are impossible to verify. Serhii Kuzan told the BBC: ""As long as Bakhmut fulfils its function, allowing us to grind down the enemy´s forces, to destroy much more of them proportionately than the enemy inflicts losses on us, until then we will of course keep on holding Bakhmut."" By defending the city, Ukraine also ties up Russian forces that could be deployed elsewhere on the front line. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made the city an emblem of resistance. When he visited Washington in December, he called it ""the fortress of our morale"" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress. ""The fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and for freedom,"" he said. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The battle for Bakhmut has raged for monthsSo what if Bakhmut falls? Russia would claim a victory, a rare piece of good news to bolster morale. Ukraine would suffer a political, symbolic loss. No longer would Ukrainians be able to cry ""Bakhmut holds!"" on social media. But few believe there would be a huge military impact. The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""The fall of Bakhmut won´t necessarily mean that the Russians have changed the tide of this fight."" Mick Ryan, a strategist and former Australian general, believes there would be no fast Russian advance: ""The Ukrainians… will be withdrawing into defensive zones in the Kramatorsk areas that they have had eight years to prepare. And the city sits on higher, more defensible ground than Bakhmut. Any advance on the Kramatorsk region is likely to be every bit as bloody for the Russians as its campaign for Bakhmut."" So perhaps what matters most in the battle for Bakhmut are how many losses each side has incurred and what that might mean for the next phase in this war. Will Russia have suffered so many casualties that its capacity to mount further offensives will have been weakened? Or will Ukraine have lost so many soldiers that its army would be less able to launch a counter-offensive later in the spring?

Russia denies the allegations.The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine. The Netherlands argues that Russia played a key role in the air disaster and the case hinges on whether or not Moscow had ""effective control"" over the area of Ukraine where the missile was fired from.At this stage, the ECHR´s decision is only procedural and does not rule on the merits of the case, but it shows the court believes Russia can be held accountable for the human rights violations in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.It could be years before a ruling is issued, but if the ECHR issues a guilty verdict against Russia, Moscow could be obliged to pay damages to the victims´ relatives. Last September, Russia stopped being party to the European Convention on Human Rights, but the court can still deal with claims against Russia regarding actions up until that date.In November, a Dutch court at the Schiphol Judicial Complex found three men - two Russians and a Ukrainian - guilty of murder in absentia for their part in the downing of MH17. The court concluded that the missile had been fired deliberately to bring down a plane, even if the target had been military rather than civilian.The three men were sentenced to life in jail but are all thought to be in Russia. Since Moscow condemned the verdict as scandalous and politically motivated it is extremely unlikely that they will be handed over to face justice.Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the attack.

The White House´s fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $2bn (£1.7bn).A further $550m (£459m) will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.""One year on, the commitment of the United States, together with some 50 countries who have rallied to rush urgently needed assistance to Ukraine, has only strengthened,"" the Department of Defense said.Just how much money is the US spending on Ukraine?Moldova warns of Russian ´psy-ops´ as tensions riseIn a press release, the White House said the new measures were designed to disrupt Russian financial institutions, officials and authorities from ""illegitimately operating in Ukraine"".It comes four days after US President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv, where he held talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. In its latest round of aid, the US government is providing Ukraine with new drone systems, high-mobility rocket systems, ammunition for artillery systems and communications gear. Earlier this week the US said China was considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia. They also claimed Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.China has strongly denied the allegations.Why China launched a charm offensive over UkraineA meeting of G7 leaders was held on Friday, where they created an enforcement team designed to stop Russia from finding sanctions loopholes.""G7 countries will continue to keep Russia´s sovereign assets immobilised until there is a resolution to the conflict"", the group said in a press release.The G7 - group of seven - is an organisation of the world´s seven largest ""advanced"" economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. It has so far committed $39b (£32b) to Ukraine´s war efforts for 2023. The US said G7 countries and allies would also impose sanctions on key economic sectors in Russia - including its metals and mining sector.""Our actions today with our G7 partners show that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.The US added that it would provide Ukraine with electrical grid equipment to protect its energy supply from Russian strikes, and with generators to provide back-up power. The White House will provide Moldova, which borders Ukraine and heavily relies on Russian gas, with $300m (£250m) to help increase its local power generation.Moldova is Europe´s poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.

Oil prices rose after Russia´s deputy prime minister Alexander Novak announced the cut. The European Union, G7 nations and Australia have capped how much they will pay for oil and refined products.These are part of western sanctions designed to put pressure on Russia over its war in Ukraine.Russia is one of the largest oil producers in the world. Its planned cuts sent the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, up by 2.2% to $86 per barrel.Western countries have been introducing tougher oil sanctions on Russia as its invasion of Ukraine continues, as part of efforts to limit the Kremlin´s gain from sales and reduce its ability to finance the war.Most recently, an EU ban on seaborne imports from Russia of refined oil products, such as diesel, came into force this week. Traders who do not comply with these sanctions have access to tanker fleets and insurance markets restricted.In the case of the oil price cap, countries stopped the use of Western-supplied maritime insurance, finance and brokering for seaborne Russian oil priced above $60 per barrel from 5 December.In response, Russia has banned any deals involving the cap. Mr Novak said: ""As of today, we are fully selling the entire volume of oil produced, however, as stated earlier, we will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the principles of the ´price cap´.""In this regard, Russia will voluntarily reduce production by 500,000 barrels per day in March. This will contribute to the restoration of market relations.""So far, according to Mr Novak, Russia has been able to find buyers for all of its output, despite the sanctions.Industry sources told the BBC that hundreds of tankers have been acquired by companies in recent weeks, creating a so-called ""dark fleet"" prepared to carry Russian crude at higher prices. The last big fall in Russian oil output was in April last year, when it collapsed by nearly 9% following the introduction of Western sanctions over Ukraine.But since then, Russia has managed to set up logistics chains for its oil sales, mostly in Asia. Last year, Russian oil production rose by 2% to 10.7 million barrels per day.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaOilFuel",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64594715,10,2,2023,"['oil', 'russia', 'price', 'production', 'ukraine', 'sanctions', 'cap', 'western', 'cut', 'reduce', 'crude', 'barrels', 'day', 'products', 'prices', 'novak', 'rose', 'refined', 'part', 'war']",0.36406249999999996,0.020703125000000003,10/2/2023

""It was like never before.""President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia´s investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.How risky is stand-off over Ukraine´s nuclear plant?Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaNuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.Electricity is needed for cooling radioactive material present at the plant. ""Today´s loss of all external power once again demonstrated how fragile and dangerous the situation is for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,"" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Earlier on Thursday he had called for an international commitment to protect the plant, following a series of strikes since the invasion began.""Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,"" Mr Grossi said.In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts.A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.Elsewhere, Ukraine´s military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.""The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,"" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. ""Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.""Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say.

These fly at nine times the speed of sound and have a range of 1,000 km (620 miles).  Moscow ""will be trying to show that despite its setbacks in the war in Ukraine, its armed forces are still very powerful"", says Denys Reva from South Africa´s Institute for Security Studies.The SANDF has said little about the forthcoming exercise, but a 2019 joint drill between the three countries involved seven ships - one warship from each nation, plus fuelling ships and survey ships. They practised tackling coastal fires and floods, and recapturing ships from pirates.How Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaWhy is this exercise controversial?A White House spokesperson said in January: ""The United States has concerns about any country... exercising with Russia as Russia wages a brutal war against Ukraine.""South Africa previously abstained from a UN vote condemning the invasion. It also refused to join the US and Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia. The South African government sparked a political row when it gave permission for a superyacht called the Nord, which is linked to the sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov, to dock in Cape Town - although it is thought the vessel did not actually go there.The sanctioned Russian cargo ship, Lady R, was also allowed to unload supplies at a South African naval base. The government said it contained a delayed order for ammunition.South Africa points out it has held four joint exercises with the US since 2011, as well as drills with France and Germany.""All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,"" said Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, during a visit to her country by her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in January.She said that trying to stop South Africa from conducting joint military exercises with the countries of its choice amounted to ""an abuse of international practice"".What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Why is South Africa taking part?South Africa is also taking part because its armed forces are underfunded and overstretched, according to Elizabeth Sidiropoulos, head of the South African Institute of International Affairs. The navy´s priorities are to protect fisheries in its home waters and combat piracy in the Indian Ocean.""It needs to team up with other nations to have the capacity to deal with things off its coast such as piracy,"" she says.Image source, ReutersImage caption, South African foreign minister Nalida Pandor hosted a visit from her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in JanuarySouth Africa´s governing African National Congress (ANC) also has long-standing ties with Russia. These date back to the years of white-minority rule before 1994, says Dr Alex Vines from the Chatham House think-tank in London.""The older leaders in the ANC still have an emotional attachment to Moscow, because it constantly supported their struggle,"" he says. ""That makes it very difficult for South Africa to turn its back on Russia over Ukraine.""Russia, China and South Africa also have modern-day ties because they are all members of the Brics alliance.The group - which also includes Brazil and India - represents some of the world´s leading emerging economies.What do Russia and China want?Ms Sidiropoulos says Russia has more to gain than anyone from this year´s exercise. ""It shows that Russia can still project its power far away, and that it still has allies around the world.""It lets them say that it´s not the world that´s against Russia. Only the West is against Russia."" China is keen to keep shipping lanes open for commercial vessels travelling from its ports to African destinations, says Dr Vines.It also wants to establish its naval power in the Indian Ocean, off the African coast.""It´s about getting its navy out into international waters.""China already uses Djibouti on the East African coast as a naval base to combat piracy, and perhaps it is hoping to get more bases.""Related TopicsSouth AfricaTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published21 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished5 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published16 hours agoFeaturesHow a tummy-tuck kidnap ended in cartel confusion.

He has publicly backed Russia´s Wagner mercenary group, which has played a big role in Russia´s war in Ukraine.He was recently pictured visiting Wagner´s Russian headquarters in St Petersburg. Another man was arrested apparently taking a sniper rifle to the protest.Mr Vucic went on TV to accuse the protest organisers of being paid for with foreigners´ cash, vowing that Serbia would never be defeated by lies, threats and a few rifles. ""I don´t need someone from Wagner to tap me on the shoulder and tell me what I can and can´t do,"" he said.The Russian ambassador condemned threats against the Serbian leader. But almost a year into the war in Ukraine, it is clear Serbia is struggling to maintain ties with Moscow while moving closer to the EU.WATCH: Serbia: The Russia Dilemma""I would do anything for Mother Serbia and Mother Russia. They are the same thing,"" said Vlado Stanic, wearing a T-shirt showing a stern-faced Vladimir Putin and his well-known quote on the invasion: ""Everything is going according to plan.""Stanic displays an extreme version of a more common mindset, a form of Pan-Slavism that believes Serbia has historic and religious links to Russia.He speaks of ""Tsar Putin"" in almost messianic terms, parroting Russian propaganda about its fight against ""fascists and Nazis"". In 2015 he travelled to eastern Ukraine to help Russian forces. Image source, Vlado StanicImage caption, Vlado Stanic served a jail sentence in Serbia after he joined Russian forces fighting in eastern UkraineHe refuses to speak about what he did in Ukraine´s Donbas region, but on his return to Serbia was sent to jail.Cedomir Stoikovic, who is one of Serbia´s leading voices against Russian influence, warns that Serbia is under ""hybrid occupation"", which has resulted in in the widespread support that Russia now enjoys.""For 15 years Russia has conducted a huge operation in Serbia. Their intelligence service is here on a massive scale. They put money here, buying media and news editors.""He has tried to launch prosecutions against the Russian ambassador and the Wagner group and is now defending a young Ukrainian woman he claims has been unfairly treated because of her nationality.The claims are difficult to prove but news coverage of the Russian war in Serbia is often dramatically at odds with other European countries.One newspaper ran a story in the run-up to the invasion with the infamous headline ""Ukraine attacks Russia"". Another ran a front-page story claiming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused the West of ""betraying"" Ukraine, when he had said nothing of the sort.  Serbia is something of an outlier among European nations in its support for Russia. It has refused to join Western sanctions, although President Vucic has condemned Russia´s invasion.Vlad, a souvenir seller in Belgrade´s central Kalemegdan park, is doing a brisk trade in pro-Moscow T-shirts. One bears the Z logo that has become the hallmark of Russia´s war. Another bestseller boasts President Putin riding a bear.""It isn´t Russia against Ukraine, it is Russia against Nato,"" he asserts, reiterating another Putin mantra.Many in Serbia have never forgiven the West´s defensive alliance for 1999 airstrikes against the forces of Slobodan Milosevic. They brought to an end to Serbia´s brutal ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo, but also caused a lingering hatred amongst many Serbs.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Kosovo celebrated 15 years of independence on Friday but it is not recognised by SerbiaKosovo is the theme that runs through all of this and a Nato-led force is still based there. Considered by many here to be an essential part of Serbian territory, Kosovo declared independence 15 years ago, a result of years of ethnic tension, bloody conflict and genocidal attacks.Relations have been fraught, and Serbia does not recognise Kosovo as an independent state, nor do the 50,000 ethnic Serbs who live there.But later this month, President Vucic will meet Kosovo´s prime minister in Brussels with the US and EU hoping that they sign a peace plan that would send Serbia further on the road towards joining the European Union, and further out of Russia´s orbit.Joe Inwood reports for BBC Newsnight and Albana Kasapi for The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4.Related TopicsSerbiaKosovoTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published21 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished5 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published16 hours agoFeaturesHow a tummy-tuck kidnap ended in cartel confusion.

""How can this be allowed to happen... One day our luck will run out,"" said Rafael Grossi. Fighting rages around Bakhmut in the eastUkrainian forces are holding on in the eastern city of Bakhmut, under intense pressure from regular Russian troops and Wagner group mercenaries fighting on the Russian side.On Wednesday, the Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said that his forces had captured all of eastern Bakhmut.The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that the claim was ""consistent with available visual evidence"".Why Bakmut matters for Russia and UkraineHas Putin´s war failed?Many military analysts say the city is of limited strategic significance. ""Russian forces remain unlikely to rapidly exploit a breakthrough beyond Bakhmut if Russian forces capture the city,"" says the ISW. The UK Ministry of Defence noted in December that capturing the city ""would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk"".Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.The fighting is part of a Russian spring offensive, which many analysts say is now under way.Michael Kofman, of the US-based Center for Naval Analysis, says that, so far, Russia´s gains have been ""underwhelming"".But, he adds, Ukraine may struggle to find weaknesses in Russia´s defences to mount a counter-attack, as Russian troop positions have been heavily reinforced. Front lines in the south stableIn the south of the country, artillery strikes continue around Kherson.Russian troops withdrew to the left bank, or eastern side, of the Dnipro River in November. Strikes by Ukrainian forces equipped with US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launchers had made Russian positions unsustainable.On Wednesday, Ukraine said its forces had destroyed a Russian ammunition depot to the west of Kherson.But many analysts assess that the front lines around the city are unlikely to change in the short term as Russia has built strong defences for its troops and equipment in the area.More than a year of fightingRussia´s invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022. Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine. They had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv, and controlled much of the north-east of the country around Sumy. Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol. But, they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.More Western arms followed and by October the picture had changed dramatically - having failed to take Kyiv, Russia had withdrawn completely from the north. Ukraine had its first major success, pushing Russia back from Kharkiv, and counter-attacking around Kherson.One year since the invasion, Ukraine is in control of Kherson and largely containing, for now, the Russian advance in the east.By David Brown, Bella Hurrell, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Lucy Rodgers, Paul Sargeant, Alison Trowsdale, Tural Ahmedzade, Mark Bryson, Zoe Bartholomew, Sean Willmott, Sana Dionysiou, Joy Roxas, Gerry Fletcher, Jana Tauschinsk, Debie Loizou, Simon Martin and Prina Shah.About these mapsTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute´s Critical Threats Project. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research.The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published21 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished5 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published16 hours agoFeaturesHow a tummy-tuck kidnap ended in cartel confusion.

It called for the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and a halt to fighting.The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.In Vienna, a large number of delegates walked out during a Russian address at a parliamentary session of a European security body.The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) walkout and the UN vote came a day before the first anniversary of the invasion. The UN vote called for peace as soon as possible. The resolution reaffirmed support for Ukraine´s sovereignty and territorial integrity, rejecting any Russian claims to the parts of the country it occupies. In September, MPs in Moscow voted to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine. The UN also demanded ""that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders"" and called for a cessation of hostilities. The measure is not legally binding but holds political weight.While the resolution was passed overwhelmingly by the majority of nations, there were some notable abstentions.China, India, Iran and South Africa were among the 32 countries to abstain in the vote. The seven countries who voted against were Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the vote ""made it clear that Russia must end its illegal aggression. Ukraine´s territorial integrity must be restored"".""One year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion global support for Ukraine remains strong,"" he tweeted.Has Putin´s war failed?Earlier at the OSCE in Vienna, the decision to give visas to the Russian delegation caused anger.Ukraine and Lithuania boycotted the session entirely over Austria´s decision to invite officials from Moscow, despite some being under EU sanctions. The Austrian government said it was obliged to do so under international law because the OSCE has its headquarters there. Latvian MP Rihards Kols described the Russian presence as the ""elephant in the room"", adding it was a ""disgrace"" that they were allowed to take part.A large number of delegates then staged a walkout during the Russian address.The Russian delegate, Vladimir Dzhabarov, derided delegates for walking out, repeating false claims that Russia´s invasion of Ukraine was a battle against nationalists and Nazis who Moscow claims are leading the Kyiv government. The OSCE was founded in 1975 to improve relations between the Western and Eastern blocs. Its current members include members of Nato and allies of Russia.President Vladimir Putin sent up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine on 24 February 2022 in the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two.The devastating war that ensued has left at least 7,199 civilians dead and thousands of others injured, according to a UN estimate, with the real number likely to be much higher.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: UN Chief condemns Ukraine war in special meetingRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUnited NationsUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64748349,23,2,2023,"['ukraine', 'invasion', 'russia', 'war', 'osce', 'vote', 'condemns', 'european', 'security', 'resolution', 'called', 'number', 'delegates', 'claims', 'moscow', 'ahead', 'anniversary', 'playedto', 'play', 'enable']",0.31027908261950815,0.013413005434282024,23/2/2023

Speaking at the conference, Mr Lavrov said he appreciated the ""well balanced"" and ""considerate"" approach of South Africa to the Ukraine war, which South Africa´s Dr Pandor said must be resolved diplomatically and through negotiation.Officials in South Africa have repeatedly said they do not condone the invasion but will not be forced into choosing sides and are continuing to engage with both countries in a business-as-usual manner.Critics of South Africa´s stance have accused the country of playing coy.South Africa´s leaders have a connection to Russian dating back to the fight against white-minority rule, or apartheid, when some members of the country´s liberation movement received military training in Russia.In recent years that relationship has grown into business ties through the Brics bloc of emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Mr Lavrov was also in Africa in July 2022, when he visited Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville, and South Africa is not alone in refusing to take sides in the war in Ukraine.Many African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West and East Africa respectively - voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March last year, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine.However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa, including South Africa.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSergei LavrovRussiaSouth Africa",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64373448,23,1,2023,"['africa', 'south', 'russia', 'military', 'ukraine', 'pandor', 'countries', 'exercises', 'china', 'lavrov', 'joint', 'exercise', 'drills', 'invasion', 'visit', 'defends', 'naledi', 'defended', 'hold', 'month']",0.19112318840579706,-0.003376152832674566,23/1/2023

""If it wasn´t for Putin what would have become of us?""So much for an oasis of stability and safe harbour. On 24 February 2022, the Kremlin captain set sail in a storm of his own making. And headed straight for the iceberg. Vladimir Putin´s invasion of Ukraine has brought death and destruction to Russia´s neighbour. It has resulted in huge military casualties for his own country: some estimates put the number of dead Russian soldiers in the tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens have been drafted into the army and Russian prisoners (including convicted killers) have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the war has impacted energy and food prices around the world and continues to threaten European and global security. All problems of Titanic proportions.So why did Russia´s president set a course for war and territorial conquest? Image source, EPAImage caption, Mr Putin attended a military ceremony on Thursday to mark Defender of the Fatherland Day""On the horizon were the Russian presidential elections of 2024,"" points out political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. ""Two years before that vote [the Kremlin] wanted some victorious event. In 2022 they would achieve their objectives. In 2023 they would instil in the minds of Russians how fortunate they were to have such a captain steering the ship, not just through troubled waters, but bringing them to new and richer shores. Then in 2024 people would vote. Bingo. What could go wrong?"" Plenty, if your plans are based on misassumptions and miscalculations. The Kremlin had expected its ""special military operation"" to be lightning fast. Within weeks, it thought, Ukraine would be back in Russia´s orbit. President Putin had seriously underestimated Ukraine´s capacity to resist and fight back, as well as the determination of Western nations to support Kyiv.Russia´s leader has yet to acknowledge, though, that he made a mistake by invading Ukraine. Mr Putin´s way is to push on, to escalate, to raise the stakes.Which brings me on to two key questions: how does Vladimir Putin view the situation one year on and what will be his next move in Ukraine?This week he gave us some clues. His state-of-the-nation address was packed with anti-Western bile. He continues to blame America and Nato for the war in Ukraine, and to portray Russia as an innocent party. His decision to suspend participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America, New Start, shows that President Putin has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or ending his standoff with the West.The following day, at a Moscow football stadium, Mr Putin shared the stage with Russian soldiers back from the front line. At what was a highly choreographed pro-Kremlin rally, President Putin told the crowd that ""there are battles going on right now on [Russia´s] historical frontiers"" and praised Russia´s ""courageous warriors"".  Conclusion: don´t expect any Kremlin U-turns. This Russian president is not for turning.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds""If he faces no resistance, he will go as far as can,"" believes Andrei Illarionov, President Putin´s former economic adviser. ""There is no other way to stop him other than military resistance.""But what about talks over tanks? Is negotiating peace with Mr Putin possible?  ""It´s possible to sit down with anyone,"" Andrei Illarionov continues, ""but we have an historic record of sitting down with Putin and making agreements with him. ""Putin violated all the documents. The agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, the treaty on the internationally recognised border of Russia and Ukraine, the UN charter, the Helsinki Act of 1975, the Budapest Memorandum. And so on. There is no document he would not violate.""When it comes to breaking agreements, the Russian authorities have a long list of their own grudges to level at the West. Topping that list is Moscow´s assertion that the West broke a promise it made in the 1990s not to enlarge the Nato alliance eastwards. And yet in his early years in office, Vladimir Putin appeared not to view Nato as a threat. In 2000 he even did not exclude Russia one day becoming a member of the Alliance. Two years later, asked to comment on Ukraine´s stated intention of joining Nato, President Putin replied: ""Ukraine is a sovereign state and is entitled to choose itself how to ensure its own security…""  He insisted the issue would not cloud relations between Moscow and Kyiv.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, On Tuesday the Russian president delivered his annual state-of-the-nation addressPutin circa 2023 is a very different character. Seething with resentment at the ""collective West"", he styles himself as leader of a besieged fortress, repelling the alleged attempts of Russia´s enemies to destroy his country. From his speeches and comments - and his references to imperial Russian rulers like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great - Mr Putin appears to believe he is destined to recreate the Russian empire in some shape or form.But at what cost to Russia? President Putin once earned himself a reputation for bringing stability to his country. That has disappeared amid rising military casualties, mobilisation and economic sanctions. Several hundred thousand Russians have left the country since the start of the war, many of them young, skilled and educated: a brain drain that will hurt Russia´s economy even more. As a result of the war, suddenly, there are a lot of groups around with guns, including private military companies, like Yevgeny Prigozhin´s Wagner group and regional battalions. Relations with the regular armed forces are far from harmonious. The conflict between Russia´s Ministry of Defence and Wagner is an example of public infighting within the elites. Instability plus private armies is a dangerous cocktail. ""Civil war is likely to cover Russia for the next decade,"" believes Konstantin Remchukov, owner and editor of Moscow-based newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ""There are too many interest groups who understand that in these conditions there´s a chance to redistribute wealth.""""The real chance to avoid civil war will be if the right person comes to power immediately after Putin. A person who has authority over the elites and the resoluteness to isolate those eager to exploit the situation.""Image caption, Newspaper editor Konstantin Remchukov fears Russia is facing civil war""Are the Russian elites discussing who the right man or woman is?"" I ask Konstantin.""Quietly. With the lights off. They do discuss this. They will have their voice.""""And does Putin know these discussions are happening?""""He knows. I think he knows everything.""This week the speaker of the lower house of Russia´s parliament declared: ""As long as there´s Putin, there´s Russia."" It was a statement of loyalty, but not of fact. Russia will survive - it has managed to for centuries. Vladimir Putin´s fate, however, is linked irrevocably now to the outcome of the war in Ukraine.

Thirty countries - just two more than last year - voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution that condemned Russia, supported Ukraine´s territorial integrity, and called for peace. Madagascar and South Sudan, who both abstained on a similar resolution last year, voted in favour this time. Morocco also missed the 2022 vote but cast its ballot in favour of the resolution on Thursday. African nations accounted for nearly half of all abstentions. Gabon, which changed its vote from being in favour of the pro-Ukraine resolution last year, was among the 15 African countries that abstained. Officially, these countries say their position is not aligned with either Russia or Western-backed Ukraine. Despite an increase in engagement and visits from senior officials from Western countries, as well as Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers over the past year, their stance has not shifted.Image caption, A Russian warship is taking part in military exercises in South AfricaA day before the latest UN assembly, Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni - but that last-minute intervention did not sway the vote. Namibia, which hosted US First Lady Jill Biden on her maiden tour of Africa this week, also did not budge.""It´s not flipping a light switch,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told The Atlantic, acknowledging the diplomatic challenge the West faces in winning support for Ukraine in some African countries. He expressed optimism, however, that South Africa - which is currently hosting 10 days military exercises with China and Russia - was ""on a slow trajectory"" away from Russia. The South African authorities have denied the war games were provocatively timed to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.Why ties to Russia are strong in some parts AfricaSome African countries had a decades-long relationship with the Soviet Union. After it collapsed in 1991, these ties continued with Russia, with many African independence leaders saying supplies of weapons and military training were key in helping the fight against white-minority rule and colonialism.In South Africa, during the struggle against apartheid, the US government designated the Africa National Congress - today´s ruling party - a terrorist group. Its leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were also classed as terrorists. Despite winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, jointly with the last apartheid leader Frederik de Klerk, and becoming the country´s first black president from 1994 to 1999, Mandela remained on the US terror watchlist until it was revised in 2008. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela (C) speak to a Soviet delegation during Namibia´s independence ceremony in 1990""Of course, unfortunately, more than unfortunately, the United States was much too sympathetic to the apartheid regime, so that history also doesn´t get erased, you know, overnight,"" Mr Blinken told The Atlantic.But the colonial past doesn´t entirely explain the current relationship, at least for some countries.Nations like Eritrea and lately Mali - both largely isolated from the global community - have found an ally in Russia. They were among the African countries which recently hosted Russia´s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and both voted against the pro-Ukraine UN resolution.Mali´s military leaders last year ordered all French troops to leave the country, and have invited the Russian Wagner Group of mercenaries to replace them in helping fight an Islamist insurgency in the country.Seven other African countries - Senegal, Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea Bissau and Cameroon - did not vote at all. The first three voted to abstain last year.It is not possible to generalise the reaction and sentiment of a continent of more than 50 countries. Each would have their own reasons for whichever way they voted. And while the vote is not legally binding, it will no doubt continue to shape geopolitical alliances in the months and years to come.

The attack would also mark Russia´s Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February, which celebrates the army. Meanwhile, three people have died in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk.Eight others were wounded in the city in Donetsk region after a Russian missile struck a residential building, the provincial governor said. The toll is expected to rise as rescuers comb through the wreckage.""The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,"" Mr Zelensky wrote on social media about the attack. ""By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.""Ukraine has recently renewed calls for fighter jets to help protect itself from air attacks after Germany, the US and the UK agreed to send them tanks. Image source, AFPImage caption, At least three people are thought to have been killed in a Russian rocket attack on the eastern city of KramatorskMr Reznikov said Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the potential offensive.In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a general mobilisation of some 300,000 conscripted troops, which he said was necessary to ensure the country´s ""territorial integrity"". But Mr Reznikov suggested that the true figure recruited and deployed to Ukraine could be far higher. ""Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,"" he told the French BFM network. The BBC cannot independently verify this figure. Russia has claimed recent gains in the eastern Donbas region and its forces say they are moving in on the front-line town of Bakhmut after a battle that has lasted months and led to heavy loss of life on both sides.Last month, Russian mercenaries and regular soldiers seized the nearby town of Soledar and on Wednesday a Russian-appointed official, Yan Gagin, said Bakhmut was ""operationally surrounded"".The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to ""undertake a decisive action"" and launch a ""big offensive"" in the east. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine´s commanders would seek to ""stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive"" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance. ""I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,"" he said, adding that Ukraine´s forces ""cannot lose the initiative"" they have achieved in recent months. The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would ""significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types"". Mr Reznikov´s comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring. But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine.""That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul.""Meanwhile, Ukraine´s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut. She added that Moscow´s troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October. ""Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,"" she said. Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces. ""There is a certain increase in the occupiers´ offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. ""The situation is becoming even more severe.""While the Wagner group has claimed it has been heavily involved in Russia´s recent advances in the east, a former commander who fled to Norway has told Reuters that he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for the group. Andrei Medvedev made an unverified claim that in the four months he was with Wagner, he saw two people who didn´t want to fight being shot. About 80% of Wagner´s personnel in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64492938,2,2,2023,"['ukraine', 'offensive', 'troops', 'russia', 'defence', 'forces', 'ukrainian', 'minister', 'reznikov', 'february', 'moscow', 'attack', 'putin', 'front', 'wagner', 'war', 'warned', 'city', 'region', 'zelensky']",0.34431055056055065,0.06324585137085138,2/2/2023

It appeared to show Yakushchenko being hit fatally with a sledgehammer.Mr Prigozhin joked about that video in reply to an inquiry from Russian news outlet Ostorozhno Media about Yakushchenko´s true fate.""Ksenia, don´t treat everything so gloomily. The kids are having fun,"" the Wagner chief wrote enigmatically. He said the case was not a one-off drama, but more like the hit Soviet-era TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring, a thriller set in World War Two. ""You know, good always triumphs over evil,"" he added.Yakushchenko´s current circumstances are unclear - and there is no confirmation that he is still alive, despite Mr Prigozhin´s message on Telegram. Yakushchenko may have returned to Wagner via a prisoner exchange, but that has not been confirmed. In the first video on Monday, released on the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone, he admitted having fled to the Ukrainian side, before being kidnapped and ending up as a prisoner of Wagner.The apparent sledgehammer ""execution"", filmed in a cellar, was presented as the ""trial of a traitor"". It was similar to a brutal killing shown in a Wagner video three months ago, again involving a soldier accused of defecting to the Ukrainians.Wagner calls itself a ""private military company"" (PMC) and has thousands of troops involved in heavy fighting in Ukraine.It began operations in 2014 in Crimea and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of brutality and war crimes.In the second video on Monday, Yakushchenko said: ""In Wagner PMC, everyone has the right to correct their mistakes. ""When I was captured, I said all sorts of garbage and I´m still ashamed, but it was the only way to survive. Upon return from captivity, I brought lots of valuable information that saved the lives of many guys, so I was forgiven, for which I am very grateful.""Neither video indicated where or when the filming took place, nor was that clear from the accompanying text posts.Warning: you may find the description below upsettingGrey Zone named the alleged ""traitor"" as Crimea-born Dmitry Yakushchenko, 44, who defected to Ukraine four days after becoming a Wagner fighter.The first part of the video showed him in Ukrainian captivity - the BBC has established that the clip came from Ukrainian channel Espreso.TV. In it, Yakushchenko suggested that Crimea might return to Ukraine´s control in a couple of years.According to the text, he had been jailed earlier for murder, but had seized the chance to fight for Wagner in order to leave jail. Wagner is known to have recruited men from Russian prisons.The video then cuts to a shot of Yakushchenko sitting in a cellar with his head taped to construction debris set against a stone wall.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, for years a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has been nicknamed ""Putin´s chef"" for providing catering services for the Russian elite and armed forces. But he has given Wagner credit for the offensive on Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, downplaying the Russian army´s role, and suggesting that his forces are more competent fighters.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64626783,13,2,2023,"['wagner', 'yakushchenko', 'ukraine', 'prigozhin', 'war', 'ukrainian', 'yevgeny', 'brutal', 'death', 'traitor', 'zone', 'soldier', 'earlier', 'russia', 'doubt', 'grey', 'captivity', 'apparent', 'post', 'telegram']",0.42080907598148987,0.03859904463352739,13/2/2023

Kyiv stood strong, proud, tall and free and Western support for Ukraine would not fail, he added. Welcoming him to Warsaw´s royal castle, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that by travelling to Kyiv Mr Biden had shown the free world did not fear anything. Nato´s role was to defend and support the free world and Ukraine ""must win this war"".Mr Putin´s speech barely touched on the progress of Russia´s military in Ukraine and there was no indication of how the war might end. The main news involving Russia´s military came from Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who accused the chief of staff and defence minister of trying to destroy his group and starve it of weapons.Image source, AFPImage caption, A Ukrainian mortar crew in action near Bakhmut this weekRussia´s president did announce he was suspending the New Start nuclear arms control treaty signed with the US in 2010. The deal caps nuclear warhead numbers and Nato, and UK leaders have urged him to reconsider.He also declared he had put new ground-based systems on combat duty. He had already threatened last year to use ""all means at our disposal"" to protect Russia and territory it has seized in Ukraine.Truth was an early casualty of Mr Putin´s lengthy speech, at an exhibition centre a stone´s throw from the Kremlin.""They were the ones who started the war... we´re using force to stop it,"" President Putin asserted in his address to both houses of Russia´s parliament. No Western troops have been on the ground in Ukraine, but Russia´s foreign ministry appeared to double down on the claim when it summoned US ambassador Lynne Tracy on Tuesday, saying that Washington should take steps to withdraw ""US-Nato military and equipment"" from Ukraine.President Putin´s speech fact-checkedPutin promotes Russian escalation in annual speechMr Putin has blamed the West and Nato countless times in the past, and he reprised many of his claims from his TV address on the day of the invasion a year ago. He reminded Russians of the war in Iraq and the bombing of Belgrade, but steered clear of Russia´s long and devastating role in the Syrian civil war, its invasion of neighbouring Georgia or landgrab in Crimea.As he spoke there was a deadly reminder of the human cost of Europe´s most deadly invasion since World War Two.Six people died and many more were wounded as Russian shells hit Kherson city, liberated from Russian troops last November. A bus stop, a pharmacy and residential areas were hit in the city centre and local media said a kindergarten was among the buildings that came under attack.In his nightly address on Tuesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia´s attacks ""did not and could not have any military purpose"", and were instead intended to sow ""terror"".He added that Ukrainian forces were maintaining their positions on the front line in eastern Ukraine - where the bulk of the current fighting is taking place - despite facing great pressure. What is the New Start treaty?Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.Each side´s limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world´s nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.President Biden visited Warsaw a day after he had gone to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky, in a highly complex security operation. The Polish president said the visit had sent ""an extremely important political signal, primarily for Ukraine"", but it was also a sign that the free world and the president of the US was with them and did not forget.Mr Biden reserved much of his praise for Mr Zelensky and the Ukrainians who had reclaimed land captured during the first weeks of the war.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Ukrainian officials said civilian were killed in the middle of the street in Kherson as well as in their homes and workplacesBut he also had words of support for Moldova´s pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, over allegations that Russia was plotting to overthrow the current government. President Putin on Tuesday stoked tensions in Moldova by cancelling a 2012 decree that backed Moldova´s sovereignty in solving the future of a breakaway region of Moldova called Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed.President Biden is due to meet leaders of nine countries on Nato´s eastern flank on Wednesday, and he went out of his way to reaffirm American backing for one of the alliance´s key pledges.Under its Article 5, members of Nato pledge to defend any other member that comes under attack. Mr Biden said US commitment both to the alliance and Article 5 was  ""rock solid"".""Every member of Nato knows it and Russia knows it as well - an attack against one is an attack against all.""Italy´s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, followed up Mr Biden´s visit to Kyiv on Tuesday with her first trip to Ukraine. Visiting the towns of Bucha and Irpin, where Russian troops murdered hundreds of civilians, she said Ukrainians could count on Italy: ""We have been with you since the start and we will be until the end.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaAndrzej DudaVladimir PutinWarsawJoe Biden",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64715646,21,2,2023,"['ukraine', 'russia', 'president', 'putin', 'biden', 'war', 'nato', 'nuclear', 'west', 'kyiv', 'start', 'invasion', 'free', 'military', 'treaty', 'troops', 'tuesday', 'attack', 'moldova', 'rock']",0.3373800505050505,0.0647695707070707,21/2/2023

The town is relatively small, with a pre-war population of just 10,000, and its strategic significance is debatable. But if it is confirmed that Russian forces have seized control of it, then there will likely be a big sigh of relief in the Kremlin.Divisions have emerged between regular Russian forces and the notorious Russian Wagner paramilitary group throughout the battle, with a jealous turf-war developing over who should take credit for the advance. Barely any walls in Soledar remain standing, Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week. Describing almost apocalyptic scenes, he spoke of the nearby terrain as scarred by missile strikes and littered with Russian corpses.Speaking during his nightly address from Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky said the battle in the region continued to rage, but avoided any reference to Russia´s claims of control over Soledar. ""Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our troops - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defence and security forces - are defending the state,"" the Ukrainian leader said. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, compared the fight for Soledar and Bakhmut to one of the bitterest battles of World War One, at Verdun.Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Thursday that 559 civilians including 15 children remained in Soledar and could not be moved out. Satellite images show Soledar devastationWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group in Ukraine?Russia-supporting Wagner Group mercenary numbers soarThe town´s significance for the Russian military is disputed by military analysts because of its relatively small size. The US-based think tank Institute for the Study of War said while it was likely that Russian forces had captured Soledar, it did not believe they would then be able to go on to encircle Bakhmut.Nevertheless, if it becomes clear that Russia has taken it, then that will be seen in Moscow as progress - even a victory. That is exactly what President Vladimir Putin needs as Russia has failed to capture a single town in Ukraine since July 2022. Since then, Moscow´s forces have suffered a whole series of embarrassing defeats. Ukraine´s successful counter-attack pushed Russia almost completely out of Kharkiv region in the north-east. In October, Russia´s Kerch bridge came under attack, with Russian forces retreating from the city of Kherson the following month. The southern port city had been the only regional capital that Russia had managed to seize since the invasion began. Capturing Soledar would be something for Moscow to present as some ""good news"" to the Russian people and the troops on the wintry front line.But Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine´s eastern military command, denied Soledar was in Russian hands: ""We won´t give any more details as we do not want to reveal the tactical positions of our fighters.""Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Malyar, said fighting had been ""hot in Soledar overnight"". Ukrainian fighters were ""bravely trying to hold the defence"", she added, in what was a difficult stage of the war.Western and Ukrainian officials have said much of the fighting in Soledar and Bakhmut is being done by the notoriously brutal Wagner mercenary group. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Ukraine this week cast doubt on a photo claiming to show Yevgeny Prigozhin inside a Soledar salt mineIts leader, 61-year-old Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed repeatedly over the past few days that his forces are the only units on the ground in Soledar. He said on Tuesday night that his mercenaries had seized the town, only to be contradicted by Russia´s defence ministry the next morning. Daily updates from the Russian defence ministry have made no mention whatsoever of Wagner, and Friday´s briefing was no exception. The military said that paratroopers had played a key part in the capture of the town. Mr Prigozhin then released a statement saying he was ""surprised"" to read the defence ministry briefing. There ""wasn´t a single paratrooper"" in Soledar, he insisted, warning against ""insulting [his] fighters"" and ""stealing others´ achievements"".And on Friday evening, Mr Prigozhin accused ""officials who want to stay in their places"" of being the biggest threat to his group´s advance in Ukraine. In a later statement, the defence ministry praised the mercenaries´ ""courageous and selfless actions"" during the fighting, but again emphasised the leading role of regular Russian forces. Analysts have long spoken of tensions between the military and Mr Prigozhin´s Wagner group. The Russian oligarch has publicly criticised senior military leaders, including Gen Valery Gerasimov, appointed two days ago as overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. While Russia has mobilised some 300,000 reservists for the war since the end of September, Prigozhin has looked to recruit extra numbers from Russia´s prisons. Andriy Yermak told French daily Le Monde that Russian criminals had been sent straight to their deaths on the front line: ""Soledar is a scene of street battles, with neither side really in control of the town.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64263119,13,1,2023,"['soledar', 'russia', 'forces', 'ukraine', 'town', 'military', 'war', 'defence', 'battle', 'ukrainian', 'wagner', 'group', 'prigozhin', 'moscow', 'victory', 'salt', 'bakhmut', 'ministry', 'claims', 'mine']",0.3433434808434808,0.038272200772200754,13/1/2023

But what has emerged in recent days in Belgrade shows that the picture is not so black and white.Hinting at less-than-rosy relations with Moscow, President Vucic said that not only was Serbia ""neutral"" regarding the war in Ukraine, but that he had not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin for ""many months"".It is illegal for Serbs to take part in conflicts abroad. What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Tanzanian killed in Ukraine: We told him not to goRussia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarThe number of Serbian recruits involved does not appear be significant. Some did fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine in 2014, but not with any sort of official endorsement. In fact, Serbian courts convicted more than two dozen people for taking part in ""fighting on foreign battlefronts"".On Thursday, a Belgrade-based lawyer and anti-war groups filed criminal complaints against the Russian ambassador as well as the head of Serbia´s state security and information agency (BIA) for allegedly recruiting Serbs for the Wagner group.In Belgrade, where provocative murals are numbingly common, the Wagner death´s head emblem appeared on a city-centre wall last week. It was signed by the People´s Patrols, an extreme right-wing organisation which has previously staged sparsely attended pro-Russia rallies. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Serbia´s president Aleksandar Vucic made clear this week that his country´s trajectory was towards the WestNone of the mainstream political parties have even hinted at support for the invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, Serbia has consistently voted in favour of resolutions at the United Nations condemning Russia´s aggression. President Vucic this week made Belgrade´s position crystal clear: ""For us, Crimea is Ukraine, Donbas is Ukraine, and it will remain so."" The US expressed concerns to the Serbian leader last week about Wagner´s recruitment efforts, and US ambassador Christopher Hill said this week he was glad to hear that President Vucic could see ""the threat to peace and stability posed by Wagner potentially operating in Serbia"". But Mr Vucic´s stance has not been enough to impress the European Parliament, because Serbia has repeatedly refused to impose sanctions on Russia. For the second time, MEPs have passed a resolution calling for the suspension of membership negotiations until Serbia agrees to sanctions.For as long as the EU showed little enthusiasm for expanding the bloc to include the countries of the Western Balkans, it made sense for Serbia to maintain friendly ties with Moscow. It reminded Brussels that Belgrade had other options. Cheap gas supplies, Gazprom´s majority ownership of Serbia´s oil company NIS and Russia´s refusal to recognise Kosovo´s independence were practical reasons to stay on good terms.But the invasion of Ukraine has shifted perceptions. Belgrade was not impressed when President Putin referred to Kosovo´s unilateral declaration of independence as justification for recognising the independence of areas of occupied eastern Ukraine.Meanwhile, Brussels belatedly realised that its reticence towards the Western Balkans was leaving room for Moscow to meddle. Accession talks for Albania and North Macedonia were swiftly unblocked - and Bosnia received candidate status. So if Serbia´s president has been waiting for a moment to pivot decisively to the West, it might just have arrived. He has been warning of ""very difficult"" conversations with EU and US special envoys - and says he will address Serbs over the weekend to tell them ""what is required and expected from Serbia regarding Kosovo and sanctions against Russia"".Mr Vucic has made similar remarks before - without ever committing to a major policy change. But this week he once again reiterated that Serbia´s trajectory was towards the West.""I know that EU is our path,"" he told Bloomberg News.

During a regular call with journalists, Dmitry Peskov told the BBC it was a matter for the defence ministry, which is yet to comment.Moldova´s country´s defence ministry described the missile flyover as a ""violation"", and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation - having done the same following a similar incident in October.The incident occurred on a day of political turbulence in Chisinau, during which the whole government resigned.For its part, Romania insisted that Russian missiles had not strayed into its airspace ""at any time"".But Mr Zelensky doubled down on the Ukrainian military´s Romanian claim, writing that the Russian missiles posed questions for ""collective security"". In a post on the Telegram messaging app, he added there were ""victims"" of the assault, without specifying a number.The Ukrainian air force said 71 missiles were fired in Friday´s ""massive"" attack, of which it shot down 61.In the aftermath, an aide of Mr Zelensky reiterated a call for the West to donate fighter jets, and criticised ""political hesitation"" over the provision of new arms to his country.Mr Zelensky himself had spent the previous day meeting EU leaders and appealing for planes to be sent - following another visit to the UK for the same purpose.Ukraine is suffering blackouts after energy facilities were targeted in six regions.Some 150,000 homes were without electricity in the eastern Kharkiv region alone, and seven people were injured, officials said. Explosions were also heard in Kyiv, although the city´s mayor said nobody was hurt. Residents sheltered in the capital´s metro system, and school lessons were reportedly held in one station.Other regions, including Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, also came under fire, and the governor of Mykolaiv region described at least three ""waves"" of missiles.Moscow has repeatedly targeted Ukraine´s energy facilities over the winter, and Ukraine´s state energy firm described Friday´s assault as the fourteenth of its kind. Such attacks have been described by some analysts as war crimes, although Russia denies intentionally harming civilians. Energy workers in the country have increasingly dangerous jobs - and 98 of them lost their lives while performing their duties last year, an official recently told Latvian media.

Beneath his green helmet, dark shadows ringed his eyes. He had been on his feet all night fighting. Like many on Ukraine´s eastern front, he is both battle-hardened and war-weary.""It´s difficult. People don´t get enough sleep. They are standing for 20 hours. The fight goes on around the clock. I can´t say more, it´s secret. But, we can´t go back.""His unit, from the Ukraine´s 35th Brigade, is part of the defence of Vuhledar. The name means gift of coal, and this prosperous mining town was once home to 15,000 people. But now it´s a wasteland - one of many on Ukraine´s 1,300 kilometre (807 mile) front line.   Blackened apartment blocks tower over deserted streets. A church has been reduced to a shell - its roof peeled off and windows shattered. A cross still stands at the front, punctured by shrapnel. In the playground, there are bullet holes in the slide. Vuhledar´s children are long gone. The town sits on high ground in the heavily contested Donbas region in the east. From here Ukraine can target rail lines used by the Russians for resupply. It needs to hold this bastion. Moscow needs to take it. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent months has been here.""The front line is one kilometre away,"" said the commander, having to repeat himself over the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire, this time outgoing. ""They are pushing, and we lack armour. We are waiting for the Lend-Lease [the US programme that provides military equipment] and we will advance."" That´s a familiar refrain on front lines here as Ukraine awaits Western battle tanks promised by its allies.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, The commander, codenamed Beast, says Ukraine´s forces are waiting for Western weapons before advancingFor now, the defenders of Vuhledar use what they have got.A few troops dart into position, to target the enemy. They lob mortars - and obscenities - then make a quick getaway, to avoid being targeted themselves.We move forward carefully to within 500 metres of the front line. The Russians have no line of sight. We are shielded by buildings. But suddenly there´s a warning shout. We have to take cover at a wall. The troops have heard something overhead, possibly a Russian drone. That´s our cue to pull back.The Russians may have eyes in the sky here - and superior firepower - but critics back home are questioning their vision.A hapless Russian attempt to take the town earlier this month ended in heavy losses and humiliation. A column of tanks and armoured vehicles headed straight for Ukrainian positions - through minefields - in full view on a flat plain. Ukraine stopped them in their tracks, much as it stopped an armoured column approaching Kyiv last year. If the Russians learned anything from that, it didn´t show in Vuhledar.About 300 souls remain in this broken town without heat or light - frozen in place by age, clinging to their memories. Solace comes in the form of Oleh Tkachenko, a jovial evangelical pastor in combat gear, who brings aid here twice a week.  Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Pastor Oleh (right) gives out food and hugs on aid trips to VuhledarHe arrives in the early morning, before the shelling reaches its peak. Soon his armoured van attracts a queue of men and women bundled up in winter coats and hats. ""Hang on,"" he says, as hands reach out for freshly baked bread. ""It´s one loaf for each person.""Valentina, who is 73, quietly waits her turn. She´s a slight figure, bent low over a walking stick, with a head torch around her neck. She tells us she has nowhere else to go.""We are frightened, of course,"" she says. ""But what can we do? We live with it. You can´t say ´Don´t shoot!´ They have their job. We have our lives.""  She recalls life before the invasion. ""The town was quiet, calm, and clean. People worked and had money. What can I say? It was a good town."" Her voice cracks and she falls silent.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Valentina is one of just 300 residents remaining in the embattled townAt the van Pastor Oleh dispenses some advice, and a quick hug before hurrying people away. Crowds are a target.""There´s always shelling,"" he says. ""We try not to gather a lot of people. We park carefully, in the safest places, near the entrance to a building where people can take shelter. We help because it´s a matter of life or death. The risk is huge but so is the reward - saving people´s lives.""  He´s pained by the fate of Vuhledar, which was his home for three years. ""I think it´s completely obvious that Russia hates Ukraine,"" he says. ""It hates our cities and our people, and it is destroying everything it hates. No matter what Russia says, its action scream louder than its words.""The story of Vuhledar is replicated in many parts of the eastern front. Ukraine is resisting, straining every sinew. The Russians are not winning but they aren´t giving up either.There is a cold hard truth on the front lines here. One year after his invasion, President Putin stills holds almost a fifth of this vast country. Both sides have signalled that major offensives are coming. The coming months will be critical.

Anatoly Antonov, Russia´s ambassador to the US, said the vice-president´s claims were a cynical attempt to ""demonise Russia in the course of a hybrid war"".They were a way of ""justifying Washington´s own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis"", he added, referring to the US supply of arms to Kyiv.But Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, was adamant that ""in the case of Russia´s actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity"".She cited ""barbaric and inhumane"" atrocities committed during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found in Bucha shortly after the invasion and the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol.""Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,"" Ms Harris said.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Evidence grows of civilian killings in BuchaCrimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.Ukraine´s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had ""waged a genocidal war"" because it did not think Ukrainians ""deserve to exist as a sovereign nation"".Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin´s invasion.This conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders. It´s a chance for them to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and demonstrate their resolve. Rishi Sunak called for a new Nato charter to guarantee Ukraine´s long-term security. Kamala Harris formally accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity. But in the margins, there have been voices of doubt. Take the prime minister of Namibia, Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila. She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains. It´s opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds. There is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia´s invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.Russia was also on the agenda during a meeting on Saturday between the Antony Blinken and Wang Yi, the US and China´s top foreign policy officials.During talks at the conference in Munich, Mr Blinken warned of consequences if China were to provide material support to Russia´s invasion.Mr Blinken is expected to suggest China is ""at least contemplating providing"" lethal assistance to Russia in an interview to be aired on Sunday morning on NBC News.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaInternational Criminal CourtUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64691001,19,2,2023,"['ukraine', 'russia', 'humanity', 'harris', 'war', 'crimes', 'invasion', 'conference', 'support', 'committed', 'ms', 'vice', 'president', 'kamala', 'held', 'munich', 'security', 'accused', 'moscow', 'called']",0.3660304342122524,-0.07245998950544405,19/2/2023

It is the largest number of deaths Russia has acknowledged in the war. Russia said that at 00:01 Moscow time on New Year´s Day, six rockets were fired from a US-made Himars rocket system at a vocational college, two of which were shot down. Moments earlier President Vladimir Putin had given his annual new year address on Russian TV.The deputy commander of the regiment, Lt Col Bachurin, was among those killed, the ministry of defence said in a statement on Wednesday. A commission was investigating the circumstances of the incident, the statement said. But it was ""already obvious"" that the main cause of the attack was the use of mobile phones by troops in range of Ukrainian weapons, despite this being banned, it added.""This factor allowed the enemy to locate and determine the co-ordinates of the location of military personnel for a missile strike.""Lt Gen Sergei Sevryukov said officials found responsible by the investigation would be brought to justice and ""all the necessary measures are currently being adopted to prevent this kind of tragic incident in the future"".Russians point fingers after deadliest Ukraine attackNYE in Putin’s Russia - nothing is normal Five ways Ukraine war could go in 2023The defence ministry´s statement was striking for two reasons. The military´s official death toll is now 89. The previous figure of 63 dead already represented the highest single loss of life Moscow had admitted since the war began. The real death toll in Makiivka could be much higher, as is claimed by both Ukraine and by unofficial Russian sources. Second, the statement said that ""responsible officials"" would be brought to justice, suggesting that something went wrong. This is highly unusual behaviour for Moscow - very rarely do authorities admit that errors have been made. The vocational college was packed with soldiers at the time - men believed to have been among the 300,000 called up in President Vladimir Putin´s partial mobilisation in September. Ammunition was also being stored close to the site, which was reduced to rubble.The head of Russia´s proxy authority in the Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, praised the heroism of those caught up in the missile strike, who he said had tried to pull comrades out of the building. Some of those returning to the building had died in the process, he added.With such a high official death toll, one would think the Russian military´s latest update on the horrific events in Makiivka would be the top story on Russian state TV news today. Not so. There was almost no mention of the story on Rossiya-24´s main bulletins this morning. Over on Channel One, the main news programme did briefly mention the defence ministry statement, but chose to bury it at the end of a report about alleged victories on the front line and losses amongst Ukrainian, not Russian, forces. ""A whole series of Russian missile attacks was unleashed on the first days of the new year against Ukrainian nationalists and foreign accomplices of the Kyiv regime,"" said the Channel One correspondent triumphantly, using common false narratives to describe Ukrainian forces. Image source, ReutersImage caption, The building housing the conscripts was all but flattened in the Ukrainian attackBut if you switch off the TV and log on to vKontakte, Russia´s version of Facebook, you get a very different picture. Communities have sprung up where soldiers´ relatives are organising, appealing for information and crowdfunding for troops on the front line. Here there is anger. Many relatives of the Makiivka soldiers blame military officials for the incident, and are sceptical of reports that those guilty will be punished. Some question why Kremlin-controlled media are largely silent on the story. However, there is little direct criticism of President Putin or of the war in general. Pavel Gubarev, a former leading official in Russia´s proxy authority in Donetsk, said the decision to house a large number of soldiers in one building was ""criminal negligence"". ""If no-one is punished for this, then it will only get worse,"" he warned.The deputy speaker of Moscow´s local parliament, Andrei Medvedev, said it was predictable that the soldiers would be blamed rather than the commander who made the original decision to put so many of them in one place. The defence ministry´s claim that military officials who were allegedly responsible for this disaster will be punished will be seen as an attempt to defuse public anger over the disaster in Makiivka, but also to place the blame firmly on the military, and not President Putin. He has yet to respond to the disaster so far, Throughout this war, the Kremlin has been careful to distance Russia´s president from any bad news coming from the front line. In November, Russia withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, a major strategic defeat for Moscow. The announcement to retreat, though, was made by Gen Sergei Surovikin, commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. President Putin was meanwhile pictured touring a neurological facility, and did not make any comment on the situation in Kherson.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Tuesday night that Moscow was ""on the eve of new mobilisation processes"". Declaring that ""their new offensive must fail"", Mr Zelensky said Ukraine had no doubt Russia would throw everything they had left and everyone they could muster in a bid to turn the tide of the war.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64159045,4,1,2023,"['russia', 'soldiers', 'ukraine', 'moscow', 'president', 'ukrainian', 'makiivka', 'missile', 'war', 'putin', 'military', 'attack', 'statement', 'mobile', 'killed', 'made', 'ministry', 'defence', 'building', 'troops']",0.40919223288788503,-0.012349818056339796,4/1/2023

The Border Guard said it will be 3m (10ft) tall with barbed wire on top.Finland shares the longest European Union border with Russia, at 1,340km (832 miles). At present, Finland´s borders are secured primarily by light wooden fences.Finland decided to build the fence due to a rise in Russians seeking to escape conscription to fight in Ukraine.The Nordic country also moved closer to joining the Nato alliance on Tuesday. Its parliament started debating a bill to speed up the country´s bid, with a vote expected on Wednesday.Work on the fence at the Imatra border crossing started on Tuesday with forest clearance, while road construction and fence installation are planned to start in March. Night vision cameras, lights and loudspeakers will be installed in certain sections of the fence.A 3km pilot project at Imatra is expected to be completed by the end of June, the Border Guard said. Finland passed new amendments to its Border Guard Act in July to allow the building of stronger fences. The current wooden fences are mainly to prevent livestock crossing the border.Since Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Finland has sought to strengthen its eastern border. In September, large numbers of Russians started fleeing to Finland after President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilisation of reservists to fight in Ukraine.What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine?Following Russia´s invasion on 24 February last year, both Finland and Sweden decided they wanted to join Nato as soon as possible, after being neutral for years.But Helsinki faces fewer diplomatic hurdles than Stockholm, and the Finnish government wants to move forward even before Finland´s general elections in April.

""They said he died a hero,"" says Uliana of 23-year-old Vanya. ""I thought, ´What does it mean, like a hero?´ It´s absurd. I don´t want a dead hero for a brother.""But her father Boris, though also stricken with grief, is proud that his son Vanya died fighting for his country. His view is that the conflict is a battle against ""a government that preaches fascism"". This claim echoes the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who says he is helping to de-Nazify Ukraine and that its government has carried out genocide - a claim for which there is no evidence. ""Before this happened with Vanya, we didn´t discuss the war,"" says Uliana describing her relationship with her father. ""But after he died we had some awful fights about it.""Image source, Anastasia PopovaImage caption, Uliana at her brother Vanya´s funeralIn a new film for BBC Storyville, father and daughter debate the war - a conversation playing out within many families in Russia today.  It is hard to get an accurate picture of exactly how people in the country feel about Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, given legislation which outlaws any comments deemed to discredit the military, or which refer to the military action as a war rather than a ""special military operation"". But a survey published in November 2022 by an independent Russian research group suggests it is dividing generations - 75% of respondents aged 40 and over said they supported the war, compared with 62% of those aged 18-24.Russian filmmaker Anastasia Popova says this chimed with her own perception as she travelled round the country to shoot the documentary. ""I observed lots of different ruptures between families. Their children were mostly against the war, and their parents - the generation brought up during the Soviet Union, who watched [state-run] TV day and night  - supported the war. I have the same rupture within my family,"" she adds, saying her father supports the military action.Relying on state TV for news means absorbing the official narrative of the Russian government day after day. Uliana, and others of her age group, are more likely to get their news from other outlets, such as YouTube and social media. ""´Sorry´ can´t come close to expressing the grief I feel inside,"" says Uliana. She says the war has changed people.""I watch people on the metro [in Moscow]. They read the news, then look away. They´ve stopped looking each other in the eye."" Popova stresses that outside the big cities, support for the war is greater, regardless of the demographic. She says this became clear while she was filming Vanya´s funeral in their home village of Arkhangelskoe, 60 miles [97km] outside Moscow. Uliana speaks of this moment of recognition too. ""When I was watching those people, it came to me that they really believed the words that they were saying,"" she says, ""[which were] that Vanya died like a hero, a true patriot who defended his motherland.""I know that something is wrong. Who are we supposed to be saving there? What are our boys dying for? I never imagined in my life that my brother would be brought to me in a zinc coffin.""Vanya was the youngest of four siblings, and the only son. ""He was a golden boy,"" Uliana says.""He had a broad upbringing,"" Boris explains. ""Art school, music school, sport… I put everything I dreamed of into him.""After leaving home, Vanya joined a literary institute in Moscow to study creative writing and also acted in experimental productions, including at the Bolshoi Theatre. Boris says this led to heartbreak for Vanya, who fell in love with a girl who didn´t want to get married.""This is the theatre world. With its own views of life. Its own ethical and moral criteria. In place of family values, they have open relationships between men and women,"" says Boris.Image source, IvanImage caption, Vanya was heavily involved in the Moscow arts scene before joining the armyUliana says Vanya seemed extremely happy in the theatre, but his father suggests that it provoked some kind of crisis in his son.""He was not satisfied with their view of the world, that they are always negative about Russia; that Russians are nobody to them; that their ancestors, the whole history of Russia is full of nonsense. He understands that he´s not like that. We talked about it. What should he do?""So, Boris says, he and Vanya agreed that he should join the military.""For a life in the creative arts.. you need life experience,"" says Boris. ""Where can you find it? We decided he should follow in the footsteps of the great writers. That´s the army.""Vanya joined the army as a conscript - and then, wanting more interesting challenges, took a military contract. He was a marine based in the city of Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea when Russia launched its major assault on cities across Ukraine in February last year. He was told to call his family to say goodbye before being sent to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.""We talked for a long time, over an hour,"" says Uliana. ""He had tears in his eyes. I said: ´Vanya, show me what you have there.´ He showed me a machine gun. Like he used to show me toys as a kid.""Boris shows a clip of Vanya´s video message to him. ""Our cause is just,"" Vanya is saying. ""Hello to everyone. I´ll write when I get there. Hugs and kisses.""""Those were his last words,"" Boris says.Storyville - Inside Russia: Traitors and HeroesDespite the huge risks, two Russian filmmakers have been filming the impact of the invasion of Ukraine in their country. Many thousands have fled. Those that have stayed have had to make a choice - oppose the war, support it, or stay silent. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)Viewers outside the UK can watch now, on YouTube (short version)He was killed near the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol on 15 March.His death brought Uliana´s and Boris´s different views on the war into sharp focus. Boris tells Uliana that she is too young to remember what he refers to as the ""brotherhood"" of the Soviet Union republics. He argues that its fall ""broke the psyche of many generations to come, drumming into their heads that the Russians were their enemy"".His language is reminiscent of President Putin, who has called the fall of the Soviet empire the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] Century"". Ukraine declared independence shortly before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.The Russian president also puts blame for the war at the doorstep of Nato and the West, which he argues is trying to weaken and ultimately destroy Russia. Boris follows this narrative too.""In today´s context, ´No to war´ only means one thing,"" Boris tells Uliana. ""It means ´Death to the Russians´. This is a struggle for the Russian world, for the Russian soul, for our culture.""It is clearly not a view held by Uliana although she does, from time to time, waver. Popova captures a moment when Uliana is on holiday in Georgia - one of the few countries Russians can still visit because of sanctions - and she and her friends discuss the war over dinner. Uliana begins to question the facts.""I want to believe that my brother did not die in vain. You want to justify the loss. It´s so painful. You need to hold on to something,"" Uliana explains. A small shrine has been erected in Vanya´s memory in the family home. It includes soil gathered from Mariupol where he died. At times father and daughter have stood before it together.Uliana says that for all their differences she wants to maintain a relationship with her father.""I can´t go to war against my own father. I can´t say ´I hate you because we disagree.´ All I can say is ´Dad, I don´t agree. That´s all I can say.´""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published21 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished5 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published16 hours agoFeaturesHow a tummy-tuck kidnap ended in cartel confusion.
