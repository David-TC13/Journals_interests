With the advent of modern times, China was reduced to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, when bullying by foreign powers and frequent wars tore the country apart and plunged the Chinese people into an abyss of great suffering. Since its founding, the CPC has closely united and led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in working hard for a century to put an end to China´s national humiliation. The Chinese people have become the masters of their future, the Chinese nation has achieved the great transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong, and China´s national rejuvenation has become a historical inevitability.Xi stressed that, from now until the middle of the century, the central task of the Party and all Chinese people is to complete building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advance national rejuvenation on all fronts. And the baton of this central task has now been historically passed on to our generation. In accordance with the strategic plans made at the 20th CPC National Congress, we must implement the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy, speed up the Chinese modernization, strive in unity, and continue to break new ground, so as to make achievements on the new journey that answer the call of our times and history and meet the expectations of our people, and make due contributions of our generation to building a great country and achieving national rejuvenation.Xi pointed out that, on the new journey to build China into a great country and to achieve national rejuvenation, we must unswervingly promote high-quality development. We must fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts and accelerate the efforts to foster a new development pattern. We must fully implement the strategy for invigorating China through science and education, the workforce development strategy and the innovation-driven development strategy, and focus on achieving greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology. We must also promote transformation and upgrading of industries, promote coordinated urban-rural and regional development, make further efforts to build a green and low-carbon economy and society, and effectively upgrade the quality and appropriately expand the output of our economy, so as to constantly increase our economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities and composite national strength.Xi stressed that we must remain committed to putting the people first. The people are the decisive force for building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects. We must proactively develop whole-process people´s democracy, uphold the unity between the Party leadership, the running of the country by the people and law-based governance, improve the system of institutions through which the people run the country, fulfill the people´s will, protect their rights and interests and fully inspire their enthusiasm, initiative and creativity. We need to implement a people-centered philosophy of development, improve the system of income distribution, perfect the social security system, and enhance basic public services. We must ensure that the basic living needs of all our people are met, and work hard to resolve the pressing difficulties and problems that concern them most. We must do a better job of seeing to it that the gains of modernization benefit all our people fairly, and make more notable and substantive progress in promoting common prosperity for all. We must strengthen the great unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the great unity of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation at home and abroad, thus mobilizing all positive factors to give shape to a mighty joint force for building a great country and advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.Xi pointed out that security is the foundation of development and stability is the prerequisite for prosperity. We must resolutely pursue a holistic approach to national security, improve the national security system, strengthen our capacity for safeguarding national security, enhance public security governance, and improve the social governance system. With this new security architecture, we will be able to better safeguard China´s new pattern of development. We should comprehensively promote the modernization of our national defense and our armed forces, and build the people´s military into a great wall of steel that can effectively safeguard our nation´s sovereignty, security and the interests of our development.Xi stressed that the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions is indispensable to the building of a great China. We should fully, faithfully, and resolutely implement the policy of ""one country, two systems,"" under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong and the people of Macao administer Macao, both with a high degree of autonomy. We will remain committed to law-based governance in Hong Kong and Macao and will support Hong Kong and Macao in developing their economies and improving people´s livelihood, so that they can better integrate themselves into the overall development of the country. Realizing China´s complete reunification is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation as well as the essence of national rejuvenation. We should implement the Party´s overall policy for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era, uphold the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, actively promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, resolutely oppose foreign interference and separatist activities aimed at ""Taiwan independence,"" and unswervingly promote progress towards national reunification.Xi stressed that China´s development benefits the world, and China cannot develop itself in isolation from the world. We must solidly promote high-level opening up, not only making good use of the global market and resources to develop ourselves, but also promoting common development of the world. We must hold high the banner of peace, development, and cooperation and mutual benefit, always stand on the right side of history, practice true multilateralism and the common values of mankind, actively participate in the reform and development of the global governance system, and promote the development of an open world economy. We should promote the implementation of Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, so as to add more stability and positive energy to world peace and development, and create a favorable international environment for our country´s development.Xi pointed out that, to do a good job of governing the country, the Party should do a good job of governing itself; and to build a great country, the Party must be thriving. To promote the building of a great country, it is essential to uphold the leadership of the CPC and the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and to step up Party building in a solid manner. We must remain sober-minded and resolved about addressing the challenges unique to a big political party as ours, and have the courage to carry out self-reform. We must unceasingly exercise full and rigorous Party self-governance, unswervingly fight against corruption, and always maintain the unity and solidarity of the Party. By doing so, we will be able to ensure that the Party will never change its nature, its conviction, or its character, which will serve as a strong guarantee for building a great country and advancing national rejuvenation.Xi stressed that the grand goal of building a great country and achieving national rejuvenation is encouraging and motivating. We should seize the day, remain confident in our history, exhibit greater historical initiative, uphold fundamental principles and break new ground, maintain strategic resolve, carry forward the fighting spirit, and strive to overcome all difficulties, to contribute to the great cause of building China into a great country and achieving national rejuvenation.Xi received rounds of warm applause during his speech.Zhao Leji made a speech after Xi. He said that he approves of and supports Xi´s important speech, which reflects firm stance with the people and confidence in our history, demonstrates Xi´s great sense of responsibilities and commitments, and guides the way forward. The speech will inspire the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to forge ahead with enterprise and fortitude on the new journey of building a great country and national rejuvenation. We should earnestly study, comprehend and comprehensively implement Xi´s important speech to the letter, Zhao said. Comrade Xi was unanimously elected again the Chinese president and chairman of the CMC of the PRC, which reflects the common will and aspirations of the deputies to the NPC and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, Zhao said. The CPC´s decision to establish Comrade Xi Jinping´s core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and establish the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is of decisive significance for advancing the cause of the Party and the country in the new era and the historic process of national rejuvenation. We must firmly advocate the decision to establish Comrade Xi Jinping´s core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and establish the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, boost our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership, and stay confident in the path, the theory, the system, and the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and firmly uphold Comrade Xi Jinping´s core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and uphold the Party Central Committee´s authority and its centralized, unified leadership, Zhao said.Zhao said that the session fully implemented the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress and the first and second plenary sessions of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and successfully completed all the items on the agenda. The session is democratic, united, realistic and progressive. On behalf of the 14th NPC and its Standing Committee, he paid high tribute to the deputies to the 13th NPC, the members of the 13th NPC Standing Committee, and Comrade Li Zhanshu.Zhao said that the 14th NPC Standing Committee was elected at the session and he was elected as its chairman. We sincerely thank all deputies for their trust and are fully aware of our glorious mission and great responsibility. We will always uphold the Party´s overall leadership, rely closely on deputies to the NPC and the people, honor the Constitution, be committed and honest in our duties, have integrity and serve the public interest, accept the supervision of the people, devote ourselves wholeheartedly to the cause of the Party and the country, and never fail to live up to the great trust of deputies and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, Zhao said.He said that the 20th CPC National Congress has drawn a grand blueprint for building a great modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. The 14th NPC and its Standing Committee should fully implement the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress, earnestly fulfill the duties prescribed in the Constitution and laws, uphold the unity of the Party leadership, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance, and adhere to the system of the people´s congresses, improve it and ensure its effective operation, so as to promote the effective implementation of the objectives and tasks set at the 20th CPC National Congress, and contribute to the building of a modern socialist country in all respects.Zhao said that we must develop whole-process people´s democracy and ensure that the people engage in democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management and oversight in accordance with the law. We should improve the institutional system to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the Constitution, and continuously raise the level of such implementation and the oversight thereof. We should further promote the scientific, democratic and law-based legislation to make the legal system more sound, comprehensive, integrated and authoritative. We should carry out correct, effective and lawful supervision to ensure the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Constitution and laws. We should give full play to the characteristics and advantages of the deputies who come from the people and are rooted in the people, and enable them to serve as the bridge between the Party, the state and the people. We should comprehensively strengthen the building of the NPC and its Standing Committee, and earnestly shoulder the mission and responsibility entrusted by the new journey of the new era.At 9:57 a.m., Zhao announced that the first session of the 14th NPC of the PRC was closed.

The demonstrators waved banners ""Stop the war provoked by the United States and NATO"" and ""Freedom, Truth, Resistance.""Many French Internet users have posted photos and videos of this march on social media.

EU must take non-ideological stance with China: Hungarian FM - People's Daily Online,"EU must take non-ideological stance with China: Hungarian FM (Xinhua) 11:18, March 14, 2023BUDAPEST, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Relations between the European Union (EU) and China must be non-ideological and pragmatic, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said on Monday.Szijjarto told journalists in Paris: ""There will be an even deeper economic crisis if trade cooperation is cut off between the EU and China for ideological reasons, so it is crucial to maintain a mutually beneficial, pragmatic relationship.""Szijjarto was speaking after a meeting with the head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Mathias Cormann.""Whether Europe will be able to get out of the current, extremely challenging period, depends fundamentally on the approach of its decision-makers ... will they be able to act on the basis of common sense instead of an ideological approach?"" Szijjarto said.""In order to leave the world economic crisis behind us, common sense is needed.""The OECD is one of the few organizations globally that is not a ""prisoner of ideologies"" but "" pursues a ""rational, realistic, common sense economic policy,"" he said.The Hungarian diplomat maintained that if economic and commercial cooperation is severed due to ideologies, either at the initiative of Western Europe or the United States, the European economy will not be able to avoid a deep recession.It is in Europe´s fundamental interest to maintain pragmatic economic cooperation with China in the coming period, Szijjarto emphasized.Hungary could provide an example to other EU member states, he suggested, since it is an important hub for the German automotive industry, as well as Chinese electric battery manufacturers. With the EU set to ban the sale of new fossil-fueled vehicles in 2035, more EV batteries will be required.Most of the world´s top ten EV battery manufacturers are from China, Szijjarto underlined. Therefore, ""if Europe cuts the threads of European-Chinese cooperation, then the European automobile industry will fail to implement its electromobility strategy, and endanger millions of jobs,"" he warned.Hungary has smashed investment records in recent years, since the country is an excellent center point for Eastern and Western companies, Szijjarto added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0314/c90000-10222041.html,14,3,2023,usa,pdo

""The fallout from this highly preventable incident may continue for years to come,"" he said.WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. state of Ohio sued railroad Norfolk Southern on Tuesday over the train derailment in the state´s East Palestine last month.Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a 58-count civil lawsuit in federal court seeking to hold Norfolk Southern financially responsible for the Feb. 3 incident.Yost´s office said the train derailment caused the release of over 1 million gallons of hazardous chemicals, ""recklessly endangering"" both the health of area residents and Ohio´s natural resources.""The fallout from this highly preventable incident may continue for years to come,"" Yost said in a statement. ""There´s still so much we don't know about the long-term effects on our air, water, and soil.""The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Ohio, cited Norfolk Southern´s escalating accident rate, which has allegedly risen 80 percent in the past 10 years.At least 20 Norfolk Southern derailments since 2015 have involved chemical discharges, according to the lawsuit.The train derailment in East Palestine, a village located on Ohio´s border with Pennsylvania, involved 11 tank cars carrying hazardous materials.Emergency personnel later conducted a ""controlled venting"" of five tank cars carrying vinyl chloride, which discharged toxic and potentially deadly fumes into the air.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw (Front) testifies at a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on protecting public health and the environment in Washington, D.C., the United States, March 9, 2023, in the wake of the Norfolk Southern train derailment and chemical release in East Palestine, Ohio.

"SVB's downfall evokes unease in U.S. banking sector, global markets - People's Daily Online","SVB´s downfall evokes unease in U.S. banking sector, global markets (Xinhua) 15:34, March 15, 2023NEW YORK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has not only revealed billions of dollars in loss but also rattled the technology industry, which had been leading innovation in the past years but yet was disturbed by layoffs and bankruptcies for months.Small businesses and start-ups using the bank as their sole bank account were left in limbo. Investors were scrambling to guard against possible market downturns. And the U.S. government´s promise to let depositors access their money cannot stop worries about a systemic contagion.WORRYING REGULATIONExperts argued that signals of SVB´s failure could have been spotted in advance, had legislators not eased rules for some lenders in recent years, according to a Financial Times article.America´s Dodd-Frank Act had required banks with more than 50 billion U.S. dollars in assets to face intensive federal supervision, but the 2018 rollback lifted the threshold to 250 billion, leaving the act unable to protect consumers from actions by banks.Despite the fact that SVB´s asset size grew at boiling speed, from 45 billion dollars in 2016 to more than 200 billion dollars by the end of 2022, according to the New York Times, the bank was below the line of the stress tests as well as capital and liquidity requirements.Here is the reality: SVB was loaded with long-term bonds as it bets on interest rates staying low. However, the U.S. Fed hiked up rates by 450 basis points in a year to deal with inflation.Central banks and regulators are to blame for failing to inoculate better standards and paying inadequate attention to interest rate risks, FT wrote.There is an old adage that the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens until something breaks, said an investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders in her interview with Consumer News and Business Channel. ""I think this (SVB) is clearly an example of something breaking.""NERVOUS MARKETSThe collapse of SVB is the largest bank failure since the collapse of the U.S. savings and loan association Washington Mutual in 2008, sending ripples through the global financial systems.U.S. regulators on Sunday closed New York-based Signature Bank, a key lender in the crypto industry, citing systemic risk. The decision was made only 48 hours after the SVB collapse.According to media estimates, 291 billion euros (311 billion U.S. dollars) of value were lost on European stock exchanges in trading on Monday.The British pound rose to the strongest rate in weeks, trading at almost 1.22 U.S. dollars. The collapse ""has hurt the U.S. dollar as market pricing of interest rate expectations has massively shifted,"" said market analyst Kenny Fisher from online forex trading platform and broker OANDA.Asian markets, likewise, sank with banks ""bearing the brunt of the selling on fears of contagion in the sector,"" French medium Agence France-Presse reported, and according to Bloomberg News, an amount of 465 billion U.S. dollars had been shed in the SVB fallout in two days.The previously 16th largest bank in the United States was closed by regulators on March 10. SVB was the largest lender in Silicon Valley and had been a frequent underwriter for technology start-ups.The move came after the bank announced that it lost 1.8 billion dollars in the sale of U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it had invested in, owing to rising interest rates.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222796.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Iran, IAEA to enhance cooperation to resolve safeguards issues - People's Daily Online","Iran, IAEA to enhance cooperation to resolve safeguards issues (Xinhua) 08:50, March 05, 2023VIENNA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have pledged in a joint statement to step up cooperation to expedite the resolution of outstanding safeguards issues.Iran ""expressed its readiness to continue its cooperation and provide further information and access to address the outstanding safeguards issues,"" according to a joint statement by the IAEA and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), which was published on the IAEA website on Saturday.Iran´s outstanding safeguards issues are reportedly one of the sticking points in the Iran nuclear talks, which have been stalled since August last year. While the IAEA has accused Iran of failing to provide ""technically credible explanations"" for nuclear activities at three undeclared sites, Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected the claim and insisted on the transparency and peaceful nature of its nuclear program.The joint statement came after IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi´s visit to Tehran on Friday and Saturday, during which he met with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and AEOI President Mohammad Eslami.At a press conference held in Vienna on Saturday upon Grossi´s return from Tehran, the IAEA chief said surveillance cameras will be reconnected at several of Iran´s nuclear sites.Earlier on Saturday, Grossi said in Tehran that the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran and the ""good agreement"" the two sides are expected to reach will contribute to the revival of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on the country. The United States, however, pulled out of the deal in May 2018 and reimposed its unilateral sanctions on Tehran, prompting the latter to drop some of its nuclear commitments under the deal.The talks on the JCPOA´s revival began in April 2021 in Vienna. No breakthrough has been achieved after the latest round of talks in August last year. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0305/c90000-10216378.html,05,3,2023,usa,pdo

The report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang on March 5 emphasized high-quality and green development.Agshin Aliyev, an Azerbaijani Sinologist, said the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the expectation of ordinary people. The Chinese government is made up of experienced politicians and administrators who understand the feelings of the people and work for the benefit of the people.Bart Edes, distinguished fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said the Chinese government is trying to strike a balance between its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2060 and its need for stable and secure energy supplies.Edes said the optimization of COVID-19 policies has stimulated a surge in consumption and business activity in China that makes the government´s growth target of around 5 percent for 2023""look achievable — and perhaps even conservative"".""Last month, the purchasing managers index for the manufacturing industry reached its highest level in more than 10 years,"" he said.Budiman from Australia added that China´s success in dealing with COVID-19 prevents new suffering that could threaten the global health situation, and provides optimism for people worldwide that the pandemic may near its end this year.""We will enter a new phase of COVID-19 which is either endemic or small outbreaks, (but) under control,"" he said.'Pragmatic approach'Fu Xiaolan, fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences and director of the Technology and Management Center for Development at the University of Oxford, said China´s GDP growth target was ""slightly lower"" than what she had expected.""I think it´s an honest, pragmatic approach toward China´s growth,"" she said at a panel discussion during the 10th Oxford China Forum held at Oxford University on Sunday. The target suggests that authorities are aiming for high-quality development rather than pursuing pure high growth, she added.Tianchen Xu, an economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said achieving the 5 percent GDP growth target should not be difficult, ""given the low base of comparison last year and the robust recovery we're seeing now"".He said that he would not regard the relatively conservative GDP target as being an indication of government ""pessimism"", and suggested that the actual growth could come in far higher.Such growth of China will be conducive to global rebound with increasing international cooperation, not only in economic and trade fields, but also educational and cultural exchanges which bring tangible benefits to the people, Aliyev from Azerbaijan added.He Xiating in London contributed to this story.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219719.html,10,3,2023,usa,pdo

(Photo by Zeng Hui/Xinhua)The numbers follow years of surging firearm sales. Yet they also underscore a longstanding tension in the system.NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The FBI has been issuing more seizure orders for guns sold to suspected prohibited buyers than at any time in the history of the U.S. federal firearm background check system, USA Today reported on Sunday.More than 6,300 such referrals were transmitted to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives in 2020 to take back weapons from buyers when background checks later determined they may have been ineligible because of criminal records, mental health histories, disqualifying military service records and other bans, said the report, citing the most recent data compiled by the FBI.An additional 5,200 directives were issued in 2021, adding to the largest two-year total by far since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System began publishing data in 1998.The numbers follow years of surging firearm sales. Yet they also underscore a longstanding tension in the system: Federally licensed dealers are permitted to proceed with weapons sales in cases when background checks are not completed within the required three business days, according to the report.Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, was quoted as saying that the historic surge in firearm purchases in the United States was ""spurred by the combination of the onset of a scary pandemic, concerns about disruptions to the economy and social order, widespread protests against police violence, some violent and destructive, talks of defunding the police, historic increases in murders and one of the most hostile political environments in our nation´s history.""""The FBI likely did not have the human resources needed to keep up with the surge in background checks for firearm purchases. So it´s a lot more people buying guns and insufficient resources to complete the background checks and deny prohibited persons,"" he said.Seizure orders are issued when analysts later conclude that buyers likely should have been barred. The FBI noted that the retrieval orders represent a fraction of the millions of gun checks processed in 2020 and 2021. The 2022 data is not yet available, according to the report.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0307/c90000-10217920.html,07,3,2023,usa,pdo
Sanctions against Sudan outdated: Chinese envoy - People's Daily Online,"Sanctions against Sudan outdated: Chinese envoy (Xinhua) 16:45, March 09, 2023UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions by the United Nations Security Council against Sudan have been proved outdated and should be lifted, a Chinese envoy said on Wednesday.The 15-member Security Council Wednesday decided, with a vote of 13 in favor and two abstentions (China and Russia), to extend through March 12, 2024, the mandate of the Panel of Experts charged with assisting its Sudan sanctions committee.Adopting resolution 2676 (2023), the council also expressed its intention to review the sanctions in light of progress achieved by the government of Sudan on several key benchmarks. The United States is the penholder of the draft resolution.In an explanation of the vote, Dai Bing, charge d'affaires of China´s permanent mission to the United Nations, said that the Security Council sanctions on Darfur in Sudan, which began in 2004, are aimed at ending the armed conflict in Darfur and helping Sudan return to peace and stability.He noted that the Sudanese transitional government and the armed opposition signed the Juba Peace Agreement in 2020, and the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) completed its mandate and withdrew from Darfur at the end of the same year.""Those positive developments pointed to a fundamental shift for the better in the situation in Darfur, and the fact that the Security Council sanctions against Sudan are outdated and should be lifted in light of the improved circumstances on the ground,"" Dai said.He pointed out that keeping those sanctions in place is not only untenable in the context of the country´s political and security realities, but also limits the government´s security capacity, negatively impacting its ability to maintain stability in Darfur and protect civilians and combat crimes there.The draft resolution on Wednesday endorses two benchmarks for the adjustment of sanctions, which Dai said appears to be a roadmap for lifting sanctions, ""but in practice it is neither realistic nor feasible.""China and some members initially proposed discussing benchmarks aimed at creating the conditions for lifting sanctions as soon as possible.""But discussions in the Security Council over the past two years led us to believe that the members concerned have no intention of lifting the sanctions and instead want to make them permanent by setting benchmarks that can never be met,"" Dai said.""The draft resolution introduced by the penholder does not address our concerns in that regard,"" he added.The envoy also reiterated China´s call for a comprehensive assessment of the existing Security Council sanctions regime and the formulation of clear and feasible exit criteria.Sanctions are an important tool entrusted to the Security Council by the UN Charter, originally intended to create conditions for the political settlement of relevant issues, he said.But in practice, sanctions have increasingly become a substitute for diplomatic efforts and even a means of political pressurization for some countries, said Dai, noting that some individual member has abused its penholdership to impose its national position on the Security Council.""The Security Council should conduct periodic reviews of relevant sanctions, and once the criteria are met, sanctions should be adjusted or lifted timely,"" he said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219581.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo
China's economy resilient with potential and vitality - People's Daily Online,"China´s economy resilient with potential and vitalityBy Ding Shuang, Chetan Ahya, and Dan Steinbock (Chinadaily.com.cn) 14:52, March 06, 2023SHI YUMENG/FOR CHINA DAILYNation reaffirms pro-growth stanceThe annual session of the National People´s Congress, which started on Sunday, has reaffirmed Chinese policymakers' pro-growth stance set at the Central Economic Work Conference in December. In light of China´s disappointing economic performance due to the strict COVID-19 restrictions, the CEWC had called for an ""overall improvement"" of the economy, starting with making efforts to improve expectations and boost confidence. In this context, we (at Standard Chartered Bank) had expected the government to set reasonable as well as ambitious economic targets to stabilize market expectations.This year, the growth target is around 5 percent. Last year, China´s GDP grew by only 3 percent, undershooting the target of 5.5 percent by a big margin. That´s why local governments have adopted more ambitious growth targets for 2023, ranging from 4.0-9.5 percent and averaging 6 percent.The inflation target is around 3 percent (annual average). Consumer price index inflation averaged 2.0 percent in 2022, and we forecast a moderate rise to 2.3 percent this year, much below the target even after assuming a significant increase in service prices on reopening.The unemployment rate target is maintained at 5.5 percent. In addition, the government has pledged to create 12 million new jobs during the year. And if the recovery remains on track, these targets should be within reach, although lowering the youth unemployment rate (16.7 percent in December 2022) will be more challenging, in our view, given an increase in college graduates to about 11.5 million this year.In 2022, the government had to under-implement spending to meet the broad budget deficit target of 7.4 percent of GDP, because of revenue shortfalls. The combined total revenue from the general public budget and government funds budget dropped 6.3 percent (relative to a budgeted increase of 8.2 percent) because of a 23 percent plunge in land sales revenue, tax refunds and a slower economy.Spending increased by only 3.1 percent compared with the budgeted expansion of 15.6 percent, and the government appears to have deployed all available resources, according to our estimate, including general bond proceeds of 3.37 trillion yuan ($490.59 billion) and local special bond proceeds of 4.15 trillion yuan.This year the official budget deficit (covering only general public budget) is widened to 3 percent of GDP from 2.8 percent last year, but the broad deficit (also covering government funds budget) is likely to be scaled back. In December, the CEWC called on the government to ""maintain necessary spending intensity while making the fiscal position sustainable and local government debt controllable"". The 2023 budget points to the government intention to provide adequate support to boost growth while maintaining fiscal sustainability.Under the general public budget, the focus of fiscal support this year appears to have shifted to expanding spending, versus tax cuts in 2022. In addition, the central government may ramp up transfers to local governments to increase their spending capacity without adding to their debt burden.Under the government funds budget, the local special bond issuance quota is set at 3.8 trillion yuan (slightly below 3 percent of GDP), higher than the original 2022 quota of 3.65 trillion yuan but lower than the augmented quota of 4.15 trillion yuan.While the broad deficit is likely to be smaller than in 2022, we think fiscal policy will become more effective in supporting economic activity, and the expected revenue recovery would allow total spending to grow faster in 2023.Besides, quasi-fiscal operations by policy banks may be increased, if necessary, to finance key projects.The government is likely to tackle the problem of local hidden debt (including that of local government financing vehicles, LGFVs) by asset disposal and/or the issuance of refinancing bonds, with restructuring also likely.The monetary policy tone is consistent with the CEWC´s message, aimed at ""keeping money and credit growth in line with nominal GDP"". We expect monetary policy to remain accommodative in the first half of this year, with reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut likely in the second quarter of the year.However, policy may turn neutral in the second half of this year when the recovery gains traction. The People´s Bank of China may guide total social financing growth to slightly below 10 percent to stabilize the total debt-to-GDP ratio.The Government Work Report reiterated support for meeting the basic housing demand, and upgrading demand, as well as improving the balance-sheet position of high-quality large housing developers. Moreover, we expect the government to continue to prioritize job creation, including by normalizing the regulation of internet platforms, encouraging the expansion of private business, and attracting and retaining foreign direct investment.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0306/c90000-10217247.html,06,3,2023,usa,pdo

Yet in reality, its so-called 'competition' means to contain and suppress China in all respects, and get the two countries locked in a zero-sum game,"" Qin said.Comparing China and the U.S. to two athletes competing in an Olympic race, Qin said if one of the athletes, instead of focusing on giving one´s best, always tries to trip or even injure the other, that is not fair competition but malicious confrontation and a foul.Qin said the U.S. rhetoric of ""establishing guardrails"" and ""not seeking conflict"" simply means China should not respond in words or action when slandered or attacked. ""That is just impossible,"" he said.""If the U.S. does not hit the brake but continue to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,"" Qin said.China is firmly opposed to such competition, which is a reckless gamble with the stakes being the fundamental interests of the two peoples and even the future of humanity, he said.""If the U.S. has the ambition to make itself great again, it should also have a broad mind for the development of other countries,"" Qin said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0307/c90000-10217864.html,07,3,2023,usa,pdo

(Photo by Li Jianguo/Xinhua)Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics consultancy, argued on Monday that more than half the effects on the real economy of higher interest in developed markets have yet to be felt.LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The demise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is partly due to aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, experts have said.The collapse of SVB has spooked global markets, but ""it´s not really a surprise, given that the rate hike was quite substantial over such a short period of time,"" Charlie Cai, a professor of Finance at the University of Liverpool, told Xinhua on Tuesday.""Historically we have had such a low interest rate in the U.S. for a long period of time. There are a lot of business models built on the expectation that the rate hike will not be that fast and steep. Then COVID-19 also gave a lot of free cash during that period,"" said Cai.SVB was built on two key strengths: low interest rates and the tech sector, but these elements also eventually led to its collapse, said Cai.SVB was shut down by U.S. regulators on Friday after the tech-heavy lender reported massive losses from securities sales, triggering a run on the bank´s deposits. It was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, and was quickly followed by the closure of cryptocurrency sector lender Signature Bank on Sunday.A security guard is seen inside a Signature Bank branch in New York, the United States, on March 13, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhang Mocheng)""Despite SVB´s unique characteristics, its failure reminds us that the financial system is more fragile than we would like,"" read an article co-authored by the Systemic Risk Centre at the London School of Economics, and financial services company Lambodex.SVB appeared to play it safe by investing deposits into U.S. government bonds, a type of investment without much credit risk, said the article. However, the risk SVB faced was not default but rising interest rates, as it bought its bonds during a period when interest rates had been very low for quite some time.""The central banks did not sufficiently appreciate new types of risk created by the low interest policy,"" said the article published on Wednesday. As firms adapted to the low interest rates, they eventually came to depend on them, meaning that when rates increased they faced significant difficulties, the article added.Creon Butler, research director at the policy institute Chatham House, also said on Wednesday that the SVB collapse had raised questions about whether U.S. bank regulation and its tech industry funding model were fit for purpose.There should be a rethink of whether the extent and pace of monetary policy tightening is appropriate for the United States and other advanced economies, said Butler.""Central banks may need to be more sensitive to the risks of financial instability as they seek to control the global inflation shock. In these circumstances, it would be better to move more slowly than risk a major crisis,"" he added.Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics consultancy, argued on Monday that more than half the effects on the real economy of higher interest in developed markets have yet to be felt.The impact of higher rates on the financial sector also appears with a delay, Shearing said.

[Photo/Xinhua]Nearly 40 million entries and exits to and from the Chinese mainland were made in the past two months since China downgraded its COVID-19 management from Class A to Class B on Jan 8, as a number of countries are expected to relax their epidemic restrictions for travelers from China.The National Immigration Administration said on Wednesday that the numbers of people and vehicles entering and leaving the mainland increased significantly since the implementation of the optimized COVID-19 response measures.As of Tuesday, immigration authorities across the country had handled 39.72 million entry and exit trips, up 112.4 percent year-on-year, and the number of inbound and outbound vehicles, boats, planes and trains totaled nearly 2.5 million, up 59.3 percent year-on-year.The authorities issued about 3.36 million passports to Chinese citizens in the past two months, more than 13 times the number issued in the preceding two-month period before the optimized COVID-19 measures took effect. In addition, 12.67 million certificates were issued for travel to and from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, an increase of 837.7 percent, and 122,000 visas and residence permits were issued to foreigners, up 33.1 percent.Lin Yongsheng, a spokesman for the administration, said that since the implementation of the optimized measures, the entry-exit flow of people and applications for entry-exit documents have risen sharply, driven by the steady increase in international passenger flights and the resumption of personnel exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong as well as Macao.Immigration authorities will continue to improve the measures to meet the increased entry-exit needs and promote exchanges between Chinese and foreign personnel, Lin said.Meanwhile, United States media reports said that Washington is planning to ease COVID-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China ""as early as Friday"". Two months ago, it introduced targeted COVID-19 testing policies for passengers aged 2 and older from China, requiring them to offer a negative nucleic acid test result within two days before their flight.In response to the reported US act to ease the restrictions, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that China always believes that the epidemic control measures adopted by every country should be scientific and appropriate.""We hope relevant countries will work with China to provide more convenience for personnel exchanges between China and other countries,"" Mao said.Meanwhile, South Korea said on Wednesday it will lift COVID-19 control restrictions for travelers from China starting on Saturday, and people who want to enter South Korea from China will not need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours before departure.On March 1, South Korea lifted its policy requiring travelers from China to undergo nucleic acid testing after landing in the country and requiring all fights from China to land at the country´s Incheon International Airport.Dai Bin, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference and president of the China Tourism Academy, said on the sidelines of the ongoing two sessions that based on the current development of the tourism market and various factors, including policy, supply and tourists' assessment of destinations, it is expected that the inbound and outbound tourism market will recover this year to within 30 to 40 percent of its 2019 level.The factors affecting the recovery of the inbound and outbound tourism market are much more complex than those in the domestic tourism market, so it will be slower than the recovery of domestic tourism, Dai said.""I have full confidence in 2023, and I think as long as tourists, tourism operators, government regulators and industry promotion departments can think together and work together, we will soon return to our ideal goal,"" he said.With the intensive release of favorable inbound and outbound tourism policies, the trend for tourism recovery has gradually emerged. According to data released by Ctrip, an online travel platform, on Tuesday, the overall air ticket bookings on Ctrip´s international platform increased by more than 80 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2022.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219120.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo

Experts share views on China's institutional reform - People's Daily Online,"Experts share views on China´s institutional reform (China Daily) 15:59, March 13, 2023Photo taken on March 10, 2023 shows the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. [Photo/Xinhua]Reform key to high-quality developmentThe Party and State institutional reform is an important measure to implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a move to modernize and improve national governance and governance capacity, and a response to the new developments at home and abroad, in order to promote high-quality development.The 20th CPC National Congress held in October 2022 made important arrangements for deepening institutional reform, which are of far-reaching significance for building a modern socialist country and promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.The financial system reform is an important part of the Party and State institutional reform. With the 14th National People´s Congress passing the State Council´s institutional reform plan on Friday, the focus is now on optimizing and adjusting the institutional responsibilities in key areas such as science and technology, and strengthening financial regulation, and highlighting the crucial links of economic and social development.The authorities will set up the national financial regulatory administration to strengthen the country´s financial regulation system. The move comes after President Xi Jinping stressed the need for preventing major financial and ethical risks, and better protecting consumers' rights in the financial industry. The new administration will unify the regulatory responsibilities of all financial sectors except for securities, and enhance institutional, behavioral and functional supervision, and improve risk management. The administration will also oversee the supervision of financial holding companies by the People´s Bank of China and improve the management of State-owned financial capital.This reform is an important step toward building a modern financial system and optimizing regulatory mechanisms.Additionally, China will reorganize the Ministry of Science and Technology, attaching greater importance to innovations in the field of technology in China´s modernization process. The ministry will focus on strategic planning, system reform and macro-management, while optimizing the full chain management of innovations, promoting the economic application of scientific research and innovations, and integrating technology with economic and social development. The aim is to establish a new national system for technology development and further promote self-reliance in technology to strengthen strategic emerging industries and upgrade the economy.To consolidate the centralized and unified leadership of the Party, the CPC Central Committee will also establish a central science and technology commission, so as to strengthen the Party´s leadership over science and technology work.The CPC Central Committee may also strengthen the Party´s leadership in financial supervision and management, which will further strengthen the Party´s institutional supervision in key areas, and leverage the advantages of the Party leadership and the socialist advantages of appropriately utilizing and allocating resources to make remarkable achievements.The Party institutions have undergone five rounds of reform since 1982, with the theme of ""streamlining"" being a significant aspect of most of them, while the State Council, China´s Cabinet, has gone through eight rounds of reforms, with the most Party and State institutional reform being in 2018. Over this period, the number of State Council departments has decreased from 100 to 26, resulting in better resource allocation, improved work efficiency, and lower management costs.These reforms have not only brought economic benefits but also improved government services and administrative efficiency. They have laid a solid foundation for further modernizing the national governance system and governance capacity, and providing strong support for the historic achievements and changes in the country.The recent proposal of a 5 percent reduction in staff members across central government agencies shows the government´s modernization efforts are aimed at optimizing the organizational structure and functional allocation, transforming functions, and improving office efficiency. This will enhance the leadership of the Party in the modernization of socialism and help China use institutional advantages to improve national governance.This round of reform of the Party and State institutions focuses on key industries and fields, and on removing deeply-rooted vested interests from them. The reform will also address the difficult and major issues of significant social concern and will have a big impact on economic and social development.The State Council reform is a major decision made by the CPC Central Committee to oversee the development of the Party and State undertakings in a comprehensive manner, meet the requirements of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, further advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, and help develop a new development paradigm and promote high-quality development.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0313/c90000-10221615.html,13,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Interview: Silicon Valley Bank collapse shakes confidence in U.S. banking, says expert - People's Daily Online","Interview: Silicon Valley Bank collapse shakes confidence in U.S. banking, says expert (Xinhua) 13:21, March 17, 2023LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), once the 16th largest bank in the United States, has ""shaken confidence in U.S. banking"" as concerns have mounted over bank deposits, an expert has said.The tech-heavy SVB´s demise has ""made people far more likely to worry about their bank deposits, and any rumors will be acted upon ... faster. I think that´s a big risk,"" Charles Read, a scholar in economics and history at the University of Cambridge told Xinhua on Tuesday.Read said that since the 2008 global financial crisis, people were no longer as trusting of the banking sector, and bank runs would therefore happen more rapidly.Technology has also made it easier to take money out of banks online, and people will do this whenever they are worried, explained Read.SVB was shut down by U.S. regulators on Friday after the lender reported massive losses from securities sales, triggering a run on the bank´s deposits. It was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, and was quickly followed by the closure of cryptocurrency sector lender Signature Bank on Sunday.Read told Xinhua that the underlying reason for the collapse of SVB was rising interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve has aggressively raised rates in the past year, in a bid to curb rampant inflation.Rate hikes have put significant pressure on the global financial system, said Read.""Banks can struggle when interest rates go up,"" he explained. ""If interest rates go up, it becomes more expensive for them to attract deposits ... It also weakens the creditworthiness of the people they've lent money to. So they find it harder to service their debts when interest rates go up.""While this is usually quite a slow process, SVB was hit hard when short-term rates rose above long-term ones, according to Read. SVB found itself suddenly in trouble after borrowing in the short-term and lending in the long-term.The banks borrowed from depositors who tended to have their money in the bank on short-term deposit, and then invested the deposit in what they thought was a safe asset, mainly U.S. government bonds and mortgage assets, he said.In his new book about the relationship between monetary policy and financial crises in Britain over the past two centuries, Read writes that rapid rises in interest rates have historically led to bank failures.These days, policymakers mainly think of monetary policy in relation to inflation, without considering its impact on financial stability. This has contributed to crises in the West, and again central bankers are facing the same issues, said Read.The U.S. Federal Reserve should have started raising rates much earlier, and in much smaller steps, according to Read. ""Banks and businesses can get used to interest rates when they rise gently, but not if they rise too fast. And that is the lesson from British banking history over the past 200 years.""The main systemic risk currently facing the U.S. economy is ""still the impact ... of the rapid rise in interest rates over the past twelve months hitting the sector,"" he said.Many banks have not declared the losses they have made on bond portfolios, and the impact of the higher cost for banks to fund themselves has yet to fully filter through the system, said Read. ""So I think we will have more turbulence in banking and finance in America and beyond in the weeks and months to come.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0317/c90000-10223929.html,17,3,2023,usa,pdo

Other targets include about 12 million new urban jobs and a consumer price increase of about 3 percent.After the slower 3-percent economic growth recorded last year, the rebound envisioned in the report, along with a series of pro-growth measures from expanding domestic demand to modernizing the industrial system and attracting foreign investment, offered a fresh shot of confidence in the resilience and prospects of the Chinese economy.This photo taken on Feb. 17, 2023 shows robot arms working on a production line at a glass factory in Jiamusi, northeast China´s Heilongjiang Province. (Xinhua/Wang Jianwei)China has the ability to meet its growth target, said economist Yu Miaojie, president of Liaoning University and a national legislator, noting that business activities and people´s lives have been returning to normalcy swiftly and that domestic growth momentum has been gathering steam since the beginning of the year.""For a big developing country like China, high-quality development requires an adequate growth rate, and we need to promote a full economic recovery as quickly as possible,"" said Liu Shangxi, head of the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences and a national political advisor.In fact, there have been increasing signs that the economy is roaring back, as proved by humming machines in factories and the reappearing hustle and bustle at tourist attractions.The purchasing managers' index for China´s manufacturing sector came in at 52.6 in February, rising for two consecutive months and marking the strongest level since April 2012. As evidence of improving consumer sentiment, tourism revenues surged 30 percent year on year and cinemas nationwide reported the second-highest box office figure on record during the week-long Spring Festival holiday in January. More cities witnessed month-on-month increases in home prices in January, indicating a stabilizing property market.A CNN report quoted Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, as saying that China´s latest ""exceptionally strong"" data confirmed a ""very rapid rebound"" in economic activity.

(Photo by Zhang Xiaofeng/Xinhua)Reaching these goals is no easy task. Despite the upward trend, Sunday´s government work report warned of external challenges from lingering high inflation and weakening economic and trade growth globally, and said the foundation for stable growth at home also needs to be consolidated.To brave challenges, a spate of pro-growth policies were announced in the report, including a 3-percent deficit-to-GDP ratio, a priority given to the recovery and expansion of consumption, 3.8 trillion yuan (about 550 billion U.S. dollars) of special-purpose local government bonds, and continued tax and fee cuts to relieve the burdens for businesses.The new measures struck chords among lawmakers and political advisors participating in the ""two sessions.""Maintaining the necessary government spending intensity will help promote full economic recovery, said Zhang Lianqi, vice chairman of the Chinese Tax Institute and a national political advisor. Wang Changlin, president of the Academy of Macroeconomic Research and a national political advisor, stressed the need to let consumption recover and reemerge as the main economic driver.Li Xiehua, president of Chinalco Advanced Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and a national legislator, said his business has benefited greatly from favorable policies over the past years and after reading the new ones, he is reassured and more confident.A heavy truck is assembled on the production line at a factory of the Shaanxi Automobile Holding Group in Xi'an, northwest China´s Shaanxi Province, Sept. 27, 2022.

The bank´s operations will resume on Monday with the FDIC in charge.All insured depositors will have ""full access"" to ""insured"" deposits no later than Monday morning, and official checks ""will continue to clear,"" said the FDIC.Deposit insurance, as per the FDIC´s definition, means that deposits are insured up to 250,000 U.S. dollars per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.The move came after the Santa Clara-headquartered bank announced Wednesday that it lost 1.8 billion dollars in the sale of U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it had invested in, owing to rising interest rates. The bank was also facing shrinking deposits as the tech industry struggled.Panic ensued, leading the share price to tank sharply and triggering the run on the 40-year-old bank that holds 210 billion dollars in assets.The SVB´s failure is the largest bank failure since the collapse of U.S. savings and loan association Washington Mutual in 2008, The Associated Press reported.More than half of the bank´s current loans went to major venture capital and private equity firms, while another quarter went to tech and life sciences companies.The bank has an estimated 6,500 employees, according to U.S. online newspaper TechCrunch. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220581.html,11,3,2023,usa,pdo

[Photo/Xinhua]China´s planned defense spending for this year will reach 1.55 trillion yuan ($224 billion), a year-on-year increase of 7.2 percent, according to a draft budget report submitted to the annual session of China´s top legislature on Sunday morning.The draft budget report, which was prepared by the Ministry of Finance, was deliberated on at the opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress in Beijing.If approved by lawmakers, the proposed defense budget will maintain single-digit growth for the eighth consecutive year. At the NPC session last year, a defense budget of 1.45 trillion yuan was proposed, up 7.1 percent year-on-year. The figure for 2021 was 1.35 trillion yuan, up 6.8 percent year-on-year.The annual Government Work Report, delivered at Sunday´s opening meeting of the 14th NPC session, said that China´s national defense and military development have made remarkable achievements over the past year, and the military has effectively safeguarded national sovereignty, security and interests.The work report noted that the military will continue to make all-out efforts to implement Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Military and the Party´s military strategies in the new era, focus on the goals that the People´s Liberation Army needs to accomplish by its centenary in 2027 and fulfill tasks given by the Party and the people.Speaking at a news conference in Beijing on Saturday, Wang Chao, the spokesman for the first session of the 14th NPC, said that China´s defense budget increase is appropriate and reasonable.""The increase in defense spending is needed for meeting the complex security challenges, and for China to fulfill its responsibilities as a major country.China´s defense spending, as a share of GDP, has stayed basically stable for many years and is lower than the world average,"" he said.A country´s defense spending is determined based on the overall consideration of the need for its defense building and economic development levels, which is a common practice across the world, Wang added.""China´s future is closely intertwined with that of the entire world. China´s military modernization will not be a threat to any other country. On the contrary, it will only be positive for safeguarding regional stability and world peace,"" he said.Song Zhongping, a military affairs commentator and retired officer of the PLA, said that China has maintained a moderate increase in its defense expenditure for many years and the nation does not seek to get involved in arms races with other countries.""Despite the fact that the United States, some European countries and Japan have tremendously hiked their military budgets, China has refrained from sharply raising its own budget though it is fully capable of doing so,"" Song said. ""Our country is not like the US and Japan that keep going after military superiority. That is not what we want. China wants a balance in economic development and defense capabilities.""The world´s largest spender on military affairs is the US.

A large proportion in the military bill will go to Ukraine and China´s Taiwan region to strengthen their armed forces, US media reported.In Japan, a record defense budget of 6.8 trillion yen ($50 billion) for this year was recently approved by lawmakers, highlighting an astonishing 26 percent annual increase.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0306/c90000-10216949.html,06,3,2023,usa,pdo

We have established a whole set of mechanisms for high-level interactions and multi-faceted cooperation which provide important systemic and institutional safeguards for the growth of the bilateral ties. Over the years, I have maintained a close working relationship with President Putin. We have met 40 times on bilateral and international occasions. Together we have drawn the blueprint for the bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields, and have had timely communication on major international and regional issues of mutual interest, providing firm stewardship for the sustained, sound and stable growth of China-Russia relations.-- Our two sides have cemented political mutual trust and fostered a new model of major-country relations. Guided by a vision of lasting friendship and win-win cooperation, China and Russia are committed to no-alliance, no-confrontation and not targeting any third party in developing our ties. We firmly support each other in following a development path suited to our respective national realities and support each other´s development and rejuvenation. The bilateral relationship has grown more mature and resilient. It is brimming with new dynamism and vitality, setting a fine example for developing a new model of major-country relations featuring mutual trust, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.-- Our two sides have put in place an all-round and multi-tiered cooperation framework. Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, China-Russia trade exceeded 190 billion U.S. dollars last year, up by 116 percent from ten years ago. China has been Russia´s largest trading partner for 13 years running. We have seen steady increase in our two-way investment. Our cooperation on major projects in such fields as energy, aviation, space and connectivity is moving forward steadily. Our collaboration in scientific and technological innovation, cross-border e-commerce and other emerging areas is showing a strong momentum. Our cooperation at the sub-national level is also booming. All this has brought tangible benefits to both the Chinese and the Russian peoples and provided unceasing driving force for our respective development and rejuvenation.-- Our two sides have acted on the vision of lasting friendship and steadily strengthened our traditional friendship. On the occasion of commemorating the 20th anniversary of the China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, President Putin and I announced the extension of the Treaty and added new dimensions to it. Our two sides have held eight ""theme years"" at the national level and continued to write new chapters for China-Russia friendship and cooperation. Our two peoples have stood by and rooted for each other in the fight against COVID, which once again proves that ""a friend in need is a friend indeed.""-- Our two sides have had close coordination on the international stage and fulfilled our responsibilities as major countries. China and Russia are firmly committed to safeguarding the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We have stayed in close communication and coordination in the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, the G20 and other multilateral mechanisms, and worked together for a multi-polar world and greater democracy in international relations. We have been active in practicing true multilateralism, promoting the common values of humanity, and championing the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.Looking back on the extraordinary journey of China-Russia relations over the past 70 years and more, we feel strongly that our relationship has not reached easily where it is today, and that our friendship is growing steadily and must be cherished by us all. China and Russia have found a right path of state-to-state interactions. This is essential for the relationship to stand the test of changing international circumstances, a lesson borne out by both history and reality.My upcoming visit to Russia will be a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace. I look forward to working with President Putin to jointly adopt a new vision, a new blueprint and new measures for the growth of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in the years to come.To this end, our two sides need to enhance coordination and planning. As we focus on our respective cause of development and rejuvenation, we should get creative in our thinking, create new opportunities and inject new impetus. It is important that we increase mutual trust and bring out the potential of bilateral cooperation to keep China-Russia relations at a high level.Our two sides need to raise both the quality and quantity of investment and economic cooperation and step up policy coordination to create favorable conditions for the high-quality development of our investment cooperation. We need to boost two-way trade, foster more convergence of interests and areas of cooperation, and promote the complementary and synchronized development of traditional trade and emerging areas of cooperation. We need to make sustained efforts to synergize the Belt and Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union, so as to provide more institutional support for bilateral and regional cooperation.Our two sides need to step up people-to-people and cultural exchanges and ensure the success of China-Russia Years of Sports Exchange. We should make good use of the sub-national cooperation mechanisms to facilitate more interactions between sister provinces/states and cities. We should encourage personnel exchanges and push for the resumption of tourism cooperation. We should make available better summer camps, jointly-run schools and other programs to steadily enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between our peoples, especially between the youth.The world today is going through profound changes unseen in a century. The historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation is unstoppable. The prevailing trends of world multi-polarity, economic globalization and greater democracy in international relations are irreversible. On the other hand, our world is confronted with complex and intertwined traditional and non-traditional security challenges, damaging acts of hegemony, domination and bullying, and long and tortuous global economic recovery. Countries around the world are deeply concerned and eager to find a cooperative way out of the crisis.In March 2013, when speaking at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, I observed that countries are linked with and dependent on one another at a level never seen before, and that mankind, living in the same global village, have increasingly emerged as a community with a shared future in which everyone´s interests are closely entwined. Since then, I have proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative on different occasions. All these have enriched our vision for a community with a shared future for mankind and provided practical pathways toward it. They are part of China´s response to the changes of the world, of our times, and of the historic trajectory.Through these ten years, the common values of humanity -- peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom -- have taken deeper roots in the heart of the people. An open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world with lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity has become the shared aspiration of more and more countries. The international community has recognized that no country is superior to others, no model of governance is universal, and no single country should dictate the international order. The common interest of all humankind is in a world that is united and peaceful, rather than divided and volatile.Since last year, there has been an all-round escalation of the Ukraine crisis. China has all along upheld an objective and impartial position based on the merits of the issue, and actively promoted peace talks. I have put forth several proposals, i.e., observing the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect of the legitimate security concerns of all countries, supporting all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis, and ensuring the stability of global industrial and supply chains. They have become China´s fundamental principles for addressing the Ukraine crisis.Not long ago, we released China´s Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis, which takes into account the legitimate concerns of all parties and reflects the broadest common understanding of the international community on the crisis. It has been constructive in mitigating the spillovers of the crisis and facilitating its political settlement. There is no simple solution to a complex issue. We believe that as long as all parties embrace the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and pursue equal-footed, rational and results-oriented dialogue and consultation, they will find a reasonable way to resolve the crisis as well as a broad path toward a world of lasting peace and common security.To run the world´s affairs well, one must first and foremost run its own affairs well. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, are striving in unity to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization. Chinese modernization is characterized by the following features: it is the modernization of a huge population, the modernization of common prosperity for all, the modernization of material and cultural-ethical advancement, the modernization of harmony between humanity and nature, and the modernization of peaceful development. These distinctive Chinese features are the crystallization of our practices and explorations over the years, and reflect our profound understanding of international experience. Going forward, we will steadfastly advance the cause of Chinese modernization, strive to realize high-quality development, and expand high-standard opening up. I believe that this will bring new development opportunities to Russia and all countries in the world.Just as every new year starts with spring, every success starts with actions. We have every reason to expect that China and Russia, as fellow travelers on the journey of development and rejuvenation, will make new and greater contributions to human advancement.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224357.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo

(People´s Daily Online/Cheng Cong)The past five years since the 19th National Congress of the CPC have been truly momentous and remarkable, and the year 2022 was of great importance in the history of the CPC.China has won the critical battle against poverty as scheduled, finished building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and embarked on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects.Last year, China achieved stable and orderly policy adjustment and shifting of focus in COVID-19 control in a short period of time, maintained the world´s lowest fatality rate in the pandemic and declared a major and decisive victory in COVID-19 response.Besides, the country maintained stable commodity price in general while global inflation reached a 40-year high. Its GDP grew by 3 percent, which was considerably high among major economies in the world.Xi stressed that the CPC Central Committee always unswervingly consolidates and develops the public sector, and unswervingly encourages, supports and guides the development of the non-public sector.He also said the CPC Central Committee always believes that private enterprises and entrepreneurs ""belong to our own family.""Efforts should be made to put in place a cordial and clean relationship between government and business, Xi said.Chips are manufactured in a dust-free workshop of a semiconductor company in Suqian, east China´s Jiangsu province, Feb. 28, 2023.

The investment of private capital should be energized, and more private capital should be encouraged and attracted into major state projects and key industrial and supply chain projects, he noted.Noting that Chinese modernization is the modernization of common prosperity for all, Xi said both state-owned and private enterprises must shoulder the social responsibility of promoting common prosperity.Xi called on private enterprises to ensure that all employees share their development outcomes.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219331.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo

K. Singh has directed power sector companies to ensure there is no load-shedding during the period.""Power minister asked all stakeholders to closely monitor the situation and take proactive actions to meet the electricity demand during the coming months,"" the ministry of power said.In a recently held review meeting chaired by Singh and attended by various senior officers mainly from the power sector, the ministry of coal and the ministry of railways, detailed discussions were held on various aspects to meet the high electricity demand in the upcoming months, especially during April and May.""As part of the strategy, the power utilities have been directed to undertake maintenance for coal-based power plants well in advance so that no planned maintenance is required during the crunch period,"" a power ministry official said.The power ministry has already directed all imported coal-based plants to run at full capacity from March 16.Officials said adequate coal stocks would be made available at the coal-based power plants and the railway board has assured the availability of enough rakes for the transport of coal to these plants.The railways would be providing 418 rakes to different subsidiaries and also enhance the number of rakes in due course so that sufficient coal stock can be maintained at power plants.According to officials, the gas-based power would be used to meet any peak demand.

Chinese experts assess Ya Ya's health and breeding conditions in US’ Memphis Zoo - People's Daily Online,"Chinese experts assess Ya Ya´s health and breeding conditions in US’ Memphis Zoo (Global Times) 09:27, March 20, 2023Experts from China arrived in the US and visited the Memphis Zoo on Saturday, where giant panda Ya Ya lives, to carefully assess the living and breeding conditions of Ya Ya, following the giant panda´s health condition that has sparked concerns among Chinese netizens.A video taken by a Chinese netizen who visited Ya Ya at the Memphis Zoo shows a staff member from China carefully inspecting the quality of her living conditions and diet.A team of veterinarians and keepers was sent by the Beijing Zoo to the US to assess Ya Ya´s breeding condition and work with the Memphis Zoo to arrange the necessary breeding and nursing work for the giant panda, read a notice released by the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens on March 8.The relevant departments from China and the US have been actively discussing measures to speed up procedures for Ya Ya to return home, in an effort to bring her back home soon, and the Chinese side has already completed the approval procedures.Ya Ya will be quarantined in Shanghai for about a month after her return from the US and will reside in Beijing Zoo when her condition is qualified. Beijing Zoo has already made preparations to welcome Ya Ya home in terms of breeding grounds, feeding plans, medical care and feed supplies.A video taken by netizens in the US at the end of February showing Ya Ya´s living conditions at the Memphis Zoo has raised concerns among netizens about her health, and they have been calling for her to be brought home to China.In the video, the bamboo provided by the zoo looked difficult for Ya Ya to swallow, and the skinny panda is forced to beg for food from visitors. Ya Ya´s thin physique and dirty living conditions have caused concerns among netizens.Entries such as ""Ya Ya continues to beg for food"" and ""what can we do for the national treasure to return home"" continue to be top searches on Sina Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like social media platform.In April of 2003, Ya Ya from Beijing Zoo and Le Le from Shanghai Zoo arrived at the Memphis Zoo in the US state of Tennessee as part of a joint conservation and research project between the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens and the US zoo.

Chinese modernization sheds light on developing nations’ devt model - People's Daily Online,"Chinese modernization sheds light on developing nations’ devt model (Global Times) 08:57, March 09, 2023Path to modernization offers world an alternative to Western style featuring colonization, pillageDiscussion of Chinese modernization has culminated during this year´s ongoing two sessions, with foreign envoys and experts hailing that Chinese modernization has shed light on an alternative development path for nations. The Chinese path of realizing modernization, centering on independence, peace and the public good, provides the developing world an alternative to Western countries' road to modernization, which was achieved mainly via colonization and pillage, experts said.Moreover, those foreign envoys and experts see hope as China embarks on a new journey and a new stage for development, as the world´s second-biggest economy responded to global expectations and reiterated its pledge to work for global development and peace, which has injected much needed vitality to a global economy that is wrecked by COVID-19, unilateralism from certain Western countries and other factors.Each town has to make its way, but without doubt, the concept of ""Characteristics of the Chinese Path to Modernization"" helps many of us to clarify priorities and objectives. Modernization has to reach all social sectors, provide common prosperity, allow personal and collective development, and do so in harmony with humanity and the planet we live on, in a sustainable and peaceful manner. In this regard, I want to highlight the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, presented by China within the framework of the United Nations, Argentine Ambassador to China Sabino Vaca Narvaja told the Global Times.Former ambassador of Venezuela to Cuba Adan Chavez told media that his country needs to learn from China about how to achieve great victories like poverty alleviation, one of the greatest achievements China has made.Chinese modernization has spurred discussions at home and abroad since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in October 2022. During this year´s two sessions, the Chinese modernization blueprint will be fleshed out with specific targets to strive for. As this year marks the first year of this new journey, the new measures that will be unveiled at the two sessions not only matter to China, but to other countries as well.According to this year´s Government Work Report, China will make solid progress in advancing Chinese modernization. ""We should, with a focus on key industrial chains in the manufacturing sector, pool quality resources and make concerted efforts to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields,"" it said.In the eyes of Martin Jacques, a visiting professor at the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University and a senior fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, instead of advocating the jungle law of nation-states, where the writ of the strongest reigns supreme, ""China propounds new forms of global collaboration,"" as exemplified by the Belt and Road Initiative and the idea of a community with a shared future for mankind, as the way of the future.Achieving modernization in a country with a population of more than 1.4 billion will be an unprecedented feat in human history, and Chinese modernization offers solutions to many challenges facing human development, and dispels the myth that modernization is Westernization, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gangsaid during a press conference on Tuesday on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress.Qin detailed five features of Chinese modernization, which are independence, putting people first, peaceful development, openness and inclusiveness and working hard in unity.In contrast with Western-style modernization, which is driven by profits and capitalism, and as a result benefits only a small group of people, Chinese modernization is to let everyone usher in such process, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.Chinese modernization has broken a myth created by Western countries that wealth can only be created via colonization and pillage, said Li, noting that the Chinese path proves that modernization can be achieved via a peaceful model, and offers an alternative for other developing countries.Western modernization vs Chinese modernization. Graphic: GTEyeing China´s developmentThis year´s two sessions, which will lay out the roadmap for implementing the plans of the 20th National Congress of the CPC and the first since China triumphed over COVID-19, has attracted the world´s attention. People from many countries say China´s development is of great importance to the world and its development experience is worth learning. They believe this year´s two sessions herald China´s entry to a new development stage that will inject the world with much needed vitality for a global recovery.I attended the opening ceremonies of this year´s two sessions - the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC). This is my first time attending the meetings of such important and top-level legislature and advisory bodies of China respectively. They are decisive for the future political development of China, Nepali Ambassador to China Bishnu Pukar Shrestha told the Global Times.The ongoing sessions hold special importance to the Chinese and the world as they are being held for the first time after China´s decisive victory over COVID-19. Therefore, all eyes are now on the two sessions, with many expecting that the sessions will come up with good news for the pandemic and wars-stricken world, Musundali Bhuiyan, a Bangladeshi journalist told the Global Times.As a committed and responsible global partner, China has also responded to global expectations and reiterated its pledge to work for global development and peace. In the Government Work Report presented to the sessions, China announced its readiness to work with the international community to put into action the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative and promote the shared values of humanity, said Bhuiyan.More importantly, Bhuiyan said, the report mentioned that China will remain firm in pursuing a strategy of opening up for mutual benefits, making the world more optimistic about a better future. Bangladesh is not an exception in this case. As a strategic partner of China, Bangladesh can also benefit from the decisions to be taken in the sessions.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219150.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo
China confident of meeting 2023 economic growth target - People's Daily Online,"China confident of meeting 2023 economic growth target (Xinhua) 08:28, March 07, 2023BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China is confident of meeting its 2023 economic growth target through hard work, an official with the country´s top economic planner said Monday.The country aims to expand its economy by around 5 percent in 2023, according to a government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation.""China is still a developing country, and development is the top priority,"" Zhao Chenxin, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a press conference.The country needs to maintain reasonable economic growth to boost employment, improve people´s livelihoods, and prevent and defuse risks, Zhao said.The 5-percent growth target, which is conducive to accelerating the creation of a new development paradigm and promoting high-quality development, is in line with current economic momentum, and will guide all sectors to focus on improving the quality and efficiency of development, Zhao said.The growth target is underpinned by the quick recovery of China´s consumer market.

Wider opening-up drives foreign trade and FDI growth - People's Daily Online,"Wider opening-up drives foreign trade and FDI growthBy Liu Zhihua and Zhong Nan (China Daily) 08:31, March 07, 2023A total knee replacement system made by Johnson& Johnson, a multinational company based in the United States, is displayed at the fourth China International Import Expo in Shanghai in 2021. [Photo provided to China Daily]Businesses and analysts say China´s strong economic recovery will result in higher levels of investment from overseas. Liu Zhihua and Zhong Nan report.Michel Doukeris, CEO of AB InBev, the world´s largest brewer, recently visited a number of eateries and bars in Beijing.""We saw bars and restaurants with a lot of people, as well. I'm very pleased to see how consumption is quickly returning to the streets of Beijing,"" he said.""The key message is that everybody is fully committed to the development and growth of China, particularly quality growth,"" he said, adding that his company will keep increasing investment in the country, the world´s largest beer market.That is just one example of how foreign investors are finding the Chinese market endlessly attractive.Underpinned by its optimized COVID-19 response and steady economic recovery, experts and businesspeople believe that China will provide increasingly huge development opportunities for companies at home and abroad, especially as the ongoing two sessions are sending policy signals of strengthened efforts to expand high-standard opening-up and build an improved business climate.Experts and policy advisers said China will likely launch more policy measures this year to boost the confidence of foreign investors while improving the quality of overseas trade and foreign direct investment.That will enhance the positive interplay between domestic and international economic activity, and inject more growth impetus into the global economy against headwinds, they said.According to the Government Work Report submitted to the National People´s Congress for deliberation on Sunday, China will further its efforts to attract and utilize more foreign investment this year.The report outlined several measures to achieve this goal, including expanding market access, further opening-up of the modern services sector, ensuring national treatment and improving services for foreign-funded companies, and facilitating the launch of large foreign-funded projects.China also plans to take more action to join high-standard economic and trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The country will steadily expand institutional opening-up by proactively adopting relevant rules, regulations and standards, the report said.""The key for China to retain existing FDI is to strengthen efforts on tasks such as establishing a unified, fair and orderly national market, enhancing policy consistency and firmly safeguarding the legitimate interests of businesses,"" said Huo Jianguo, vice-chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies.""With that, we will not only stabilize FDI, but also offset disruption to China´s industrial and supply chains from factors such as the United States' attempts to decouple.""To spur a new influx of FDI, he said China is expected to increase the level of openness in the services sector, improve the implementation of laws and policy measures that enable foreign investors, and revise regulations and legal provisions that do not conform to the principle of national treatment of overseas investors.Huo also urged further expansion of market entry in China´s high-tech industries and improved regulations on cross-border travel for professionals working in the sector to expand FDI in related industries.Zhang Yuyan, director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the country is expected to focus on its own agendas, despite external challenges such as growing protectionism.Strengthening efforts to expand high-level opening-up will create a more enabling environment for trade and investment, said Zhang, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0307/c90000-10217510.html,07,3,2023,usa,pdo
Experts: US bank collapse result of failure to adhere to core activities - People's Daily Online,"Experts: US bank collapse result of failure to adhere to core activitiesBy JIANG XUEQING (China Daily) 09:46, March 14, 2023The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank will not affect China´s banking industry but has highlighted the importance for banks of adhering to their primary business, serving the real economy, balancing their asset-liability structure and steering clear of excessive liquidity risk, experts said.The bank failure has little to do with its sci-tech lending business. Instead, the biggest problem with SVB is its expansion in recent years. A considerable aspect of its business deviated from sci-tech finance, which led to liquidity issues, said Zeng Gang, director of the Shanghai Institution for Finance &Development.""If SVB remained focused on offering loans to sci-tech enterprises, it would not end up in its current situation. I think Chinese banks will have no trepidation about sci-tech finance but will be more aware of the importance of focusing on their primary business and serving the real economy,"" Zeng said.In the past few years, the proportion of SVB´s investments in financial markets increased rapidly. The main losses suffered by the lender came from such investments, he added.The tech startup-focused bank, the 16th biggest lender by assets in the United States at the end of last year, became the largest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis. California banking regulators closed the lender on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver for later disposition of its assets.US regulators said on Sunday that SVB depositors will have access to all their money starting Monday, and a new facility will be set up to give lenders access to emergency funds in order to shore up confidence in the banking system.Zhang Qiaoyun, head of the Yangtze River financial research institute at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, said SVB is a bank with obvious investment and investment banking characteristics.Apart from various bond investments, the bank adopted an investment and loan linkage mechanism to support tech startups. At the same time, its securities assets fluctuated greatly, which led to significant volatility, said Zhang in an article published on the financial research institute´s WeChat official account on Monday.In terms of utilization of funds, a bank´s top priority is to lend, followed by moderate investment activities, rather than investment banking. Typical investment banking activities are not the inherent strengths of banks, Zhang said.China´s commercial banks and financial regulators must learn from the failure of SVB during the Fed´s aggressive interest rate hike cycle, due to mismatches between long-term investments and short-term liabilities, Zhang added.""The demise of SVB tells us that once the macroeconomy enters an interest rate hike cycle, especially a prolonged and aggressive one, regulators should require lenders to take measures to optimize their asset structure in advance, particularly by closely monitoring banks' market and credit risks, which can be transformed into liquidity risk and ultimately lead to a crisis of trust and bank runs,"" said Zhang in the article.SPD Silicon Valley Bank, with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Silicon Valley Bank each holding a 50 percent stake in the joint venture, issued an announcement on Saturday, saying it is a legally registered corporate bank in China and has a standardized corporate governance structure and an independent balance sheet. ""As China´s first technology bank, SPD Silicon Valley Bank is committed to serving Chinese innovative companies and always operates in compliance with Chinese laws and regulations,"" said the bank, which was established in August 2012.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0314/c90000-10221959.html,14,3,2023,usa,pdo

[Photo/Xinhua]A low profile in mediation, great pragmatism and having no self-interests are some of the key factors behind Beijing´s successful facilitation of the landmark reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran last week, observers said.After severing ties in 2016 and a standoff lasting seven years, Saudi Arabia and Iran sent high-level delegations to Beijing for five days of talks last week, which started on March 6 and were mediated by China, the Foreign Ministry said.The talks were ""in response to the initiative of President Xi Jinping of China´s support for developing good neighborly relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran"", the ministry said.China, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached an agreement and issued a joint statement on Friday evening stating that Saudi Arabia and Iran had agreed to resume diplomatic relations and reopen their embassies and missions within two months.Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, held separate dialogues with the two delegations and chaired the talks' opening and closing ceremonies.No matter how complicated the issues are and how acute the challenges are, ""a mutually acceptable solution can surely be found"" as long as dialogue on an equal footing is conducted in a spirit of mutual respect, Wang told reporters after the talks.""China has no intention to and will not seek to fill so-called vacuums or put up exclusive blocs. China always believes that the future of the Middle East should always be in the hands of the countries in the region,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a written response to the media on Saturday.In a statement on Friday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his appreciation to China ""for hosting these recent talks and for promoting dialogue between the two countries"", saying that ""good neighborly relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia are essential for the stability of the Gulf region"".Also on Friday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said, ""What fantastic news today in a world where we are unfortunately no longer used to receiving good news.""The agreement also shows the leadership role that China is taking on the international stage, ""a leadership role that is focused on uniting rather than dividing"" and ""forming win-win cooperation and encouraging dispute resolution, rather than encouraging perpetual disputes"", he added.On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Qin Gang answered a question about the Middle East at a news conference on the sidelines of the two sessions in Beijing without mentioning the talks. He said that China ""will continue to uphold justice"" and support Middle Eastern countries in promoting political solutions to hot-spot issues.Li Shaoxian, director of Ningxia University´s China-Arab Research Institute, said behind China´s successful final push in the reconciliation are ""trust from both countries, Beijing´s patience, Chinese diplomatic wisdom and a great sense of duty"".""China honored its role as a responsible major country by showing the courage to undertake such a demanding task. This is a successful example of putting into practice the China-proposed Global Security Initiative and jointly building a community with a shared future for mankind,"" he said.Wu Sike, China´s former special envoy on Middle East affairs, said the resumption of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major players in the Middle East, will help facilitate the resolution of hotspot issues in the region, including those in Yemen and Syria as well as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.He said that while China´s philosophy advocates common and sustained security, there is another kind of outlook that seeks one country´s own security at the expense of others.""The world sees clearly which security outlook is better"" in having positive impacts on global security issues, Wu told the Beijing Daily newspaper.Factors behind the Saudi Arabia-Iran agreement also include the increased sense of strategic autonomy of Middle East countries, the continued de-escalation of tension between some countries and a decrease in interference and disruption from external major countries, experts said.The sanctions that the United States has imposed on Iran for over 40 years have not really solved any problems and have not brought peace to the Middle East, they added.John Kirby, a coordinator for strategic communications at the US National Security Council, said at a briefing on Friday that Washington welcomes the agreement ""if it can be sustained"". He added that the US ""has also worked on de-escalation through its own 'effective combination of deterrence and diplomacy'"".Niu Xinchun, director of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations' Institute of Middle East Studies, said that despite the US' great influence on Middle East affairs, it is common for the US to pull the strings behind turmoil, directly intervene in conflicts, attach political conditions to areas such as negotiations, and seek to gain benefits from the countries involved.""This makes the US unable to stand in an objective, neutral position to mediate conflicts and relations, and even has a negative impact on resolving regional conflicts,"" Niu said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0313/c90000-10221036.html,13,3,2023,usa,pdo

During the interview, Shan recounted how domestically made heavy machinery has gained presence at home and abroad over the years.At the deliberation with deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu province, Shan delivered more good news to Xi.""The 220-(metric) ton all-terrain crane, the model you rode in 2017 during your inspection tour of XCMG, can now be 100 percent domestically produced as compared to 71 percent in the past,"" Shan told Xi.""What about the chips in the cranes? Are they also homegrown?"" Xi inquired.Shan´s was an affirmative reply.XCMG´s progress on the chips front exemplifies China´s efforts to achieve proficiency in the sector that has become strategically important in terms of national security. China´s growing capabilities in chipmaking, experts said, are laying a strong foundation for the country´s sprawling digital economy.The latest Government Work Report, revealed during the two sessions, or the top legislative and political advisory meetings, stated that key priorities this year include pooling of quality resources and concerted efforts to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields.Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology, the nation´s top industry regulator, said, ""Persistent efforts are needed to tackle problems in crucial technologies.""One of the ministry´s top priorities during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period is to advance the modernization of industrial chains and encourage companies to develop core technologies, such as high-end semiconductor equipment.Reflecting the strong resolve is the significant rise in the number of senior executives and academicians involved in the semiconductor sector who are among this year´s deputies to the NPC and national political advisers.For instance, Zhang Suxin, chairman of chipmaker Huahong Group, was elected a deputy to the NPC for the first time. Chen Tianshi, chairman of Cambricon Technology, a Chinese AI chip company, was also elected a national political adviser for the first time.Other newly elected chip-related national legislators include Li Shushen, a renowned semiconductor expert and president of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Fu Zhiwei, chairman of Xuzhou B&C Chemical Co Ltd, a domestic company specializing in photoresist, a photosensitive material crucial for chipmaking.They have all called for more efforts to develop the strategically important sector, including drafting a chip law to pursue breakthroughs.Xie Shanghua, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the nation´s top political advisory body, said it is necessary to prioritize the development of chips as part of the national security strategy.In her proposal to the two sessions, Xie said the NPC should take the lead in formulating a chip law, among other measures, to ensure the sustainable, healthy and high-quality development of the semiconductor sector over the medium to long term.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224558.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo

""The expert´s view was echoed by Yasin Al-Tamimi, a political analyst and writer, who said ""the agreement, which marks a new chapter in the relationship between the two countries, is expected to have an impact on the conflict in Yemen and could give Riyadh the impetus it needs to end Yemen´s war.""Al-Tamimi said ""to achieve this goal, it is believed that a negotiated settlement will be necessary. Such an agreement would enable Saudi Arabia to maintain its influence over the political landscape of Yemen while at the same time providing a pathway towards peace and stability in the region.""The civil war erupted in Yemen in late 2014 when the Iran-backed Houthi militia seized control of some northern cities and forced the Saudi-backed Yemeni government out of the capital Sanaa.The war has killed tens of thousands of Yemenis, displaced 4 million people, and pushed the country to the brink of famine.In a statement released by the country´s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Yemeni government welcomed the recent agreement as a potential opportunity to improve relations and serve the region´s stability.Meanwhile, Houthi group spokesperson Mohammad Abdul-Salam wrote on Twitter that the group´s leaders welcome the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, believing it would promote stability in the region. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222935.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo

Human rights protection is a pretense of the U.S., which covers a ""black hole"" of the human rights situation in the U.S.The U.S. Department of Labor announced that it found that Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI), one of the nation’s largest food safety sanitation services providers, employed over 100 children in hazardous occupations, and had them working overnight shifts at meat processing facilities. The minors were working with hazardous chemicals and cleaning meat processing equipment, and suffered injuries while working for PSSI.Child labor is a chronic illness of U.S. society. The country has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child yet, and has been criticized by the International Labor Organization many times. The Guardian reported that child labor law violations have increased in the U.S., with a 37 percent increase in fiscal year 2022, including 688 children working in hazardous conditions. Estimates by the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs suggest that there are 500,000 to 800,000 child farmworkers in the U.S. These facts are a sharp reminder that the U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, can hardly protect the legitimate rights of children. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10220276.html,10,3,2023,usa,pdo

"Xi calls for guiding healthy, high-quality development of private sector - People's Daily Online","Xi calls for guiding healthy, high-quality development of private sector (Xinhua) 09:05, March 08, 2023BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited on Monday afternoon national political advisors from the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), who are attending the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).Xi participated in their joint panel discussion and heard their comments and suggestions. He stressed that the CPC Central Committee always stays committed to unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector of the economy, and at the same time unswervingly encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector of the economy. The non-public sector´s status and functions in the country´s economic and social development have not changed, the principle and policies to unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the sector have not changed, and the principle and policies to provide a sound environment and more opportunities to the sector have not changed. The CPC Central Committee has always considered private enterprises and private entrepreneurs as being in our ranks. Efforts should be made to guide private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to understand the principles and policies of the CPC Central Committee, and boost their confidence and unburden them of their worries, so that they can ambitiously pursue development, and therefore the healthy, high-quality development of the private sector can be achieved.Ahead of International Women´s Day, which is celebrated on March 8, Xi, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended holiday greetings and best wishes to female deputies to the National People´s Congress (NPC), female members of the CPPCC National Committee, and female staff of the two sessions. Greetings and best wishes were also extended to women from all ethnic groups and sectors of society on the Chinese mainland, to female compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas.Those who joined Xi in the visit and the discussion included Wang Huning, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and presides over the meetings of the presidium of the first session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, and Cai Qi and Ding Xuexiang, also members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.During the joint panel discussion, CPPCC members Zeng Yuqun, Xie Dong, Liu Zhendong, Chen Xiaoping, Xie Ru and Sun Dongsheng made remarks regarding topics on developing a globally competitive new energy industry, providing financial support for scientific and technological innovation, creating a better environment for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, promoting the high-quality development of platform economy, advancing the revitalization of rural industries, and how to give full play to the strengths and vitality of the private sector.Xi made an important speech after listening carefully to the members. He said he was pleased to visit and have discussions with national political advisors from the CNDCA and the ACFIC. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, he extended sincere greetings to those who were present, to members of the CNDCA and the ACFIC and individuals from the non-public sector of the economy, and to all CPPCC members.Xi stressed that the year 2022 was an extremely crucial year of great importance in the history of the CPC and the country. Faced with high winds and choppy waters in the international environment and multiple greater-than-expected factors at home, with all the Chinese people meeting difficulties head-on and striving in unity, we secured some accomplishments of major significance and far-reaching influence, resulting in substantial achievements in advancing the cause of the Party and the country.The CPC successfully convened its 20th National Congress, drawing an ambitious blueprint for building a modern socialist country in all respects. We overcame difficulties and challenges including the COVID-19 epidemic, and safely and successfully hosted the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics as scheduled. We dynamically optimized and adjusted the measures and policies for COVID-19 prevention and control, securing a smooth transition within a relatively short period of time. As a result, China´s mortality rate of COVID-19 has been kept at the lowest level globally. We have scored a major and decisive victory in our response to COVID-19. We fully and faithfully applied the new development philosophy on all fronts and focused on fostering a new development pattern and promoting high-quality development. While the global inflation reached a new high in over four decades, consumer prices in China remained stable in general. China´s economic growth for the whole year was 3 percent, which is quite high among major economies in the world. All these achievements did not come easily.Xi pointed out that the past five years since the 19th CPC National Congress have been truly momentous and extraordinary. The external environment for China´s development has changed drastically, with uncertainties and unexpected factors increasing remarkably. In particular, Western countries headed by the United States have contained, encircled and suppressed China in an all-round way, bringing unprecedentedly severe challenges to China´s development. At the same time, China has also faced various difficulties such as the resurging COVID-19 epidemic and the mounting downward pressure facing the domestic economy.Adhering to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, we have met obstacles and difficulties head on and responded to them calmly, remained unswayed by fallacies, not cowed by pressure or hardships. China´s GDP registered an annual growth rate of 5.2 percent over the past five years. We won the critical battle against poverty as scheduled and finished building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, thus attaining the First Centenary Goal, achieving impressive advances in the cause of the Party and the country, and taking China on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects. The achievements of the past five years should be attributed to the concerted efforts of the whole Party and the Chinese people, as well as to the contribution of the CPPCC members.Xi stressed that, in the face of profound and complex changes in the international and domestic environment, we must remain calm, maintain firm resolve, pursue progress while ensuring stability, demonstrate enterprise in our work, unite as one, and have the courage to carry on our fight. To remain calm and maintain firm resolve means to keep a cool head in observing the profound changes in the international landscape, and calmly respond to various risks and challenges. We should accurately identify, soundly respond to, and actively steer changes, and timely optimize and adjust our strategies and policies. At the same time, we should maintain firm strategic resolve, stay tenacious, never be afraid of any risks, and move forward firmly toward the established strategic plans. To sustain progress while ensuring stability and demonstrate enterprise in our work means to maintain stability in our general direction, principles and polices, as well as strategic plans. On the basis of securing our foundation and position, we must forge ahead vigorously, move forward as fast as possible and strive for the best possible results.We should unite as one and have the courage to carry on our fight as we draw our strengths from unity. Over the years, we have encountered various risks, challenges and battles one after another, and have overcome every one of them with all the people striving in unity and fighting tenaciously. In the near future, we will only face more and increasingly serious risks and challenges. Only when all the people work together with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and have the courage and ability to carry out our fight, will we continue to win new and greater victories.Xi pointed out that the private sector is an important force for our Party to maintain its long-term governance and to unite and lead the people of all ethnic groups to realize the Two Centenary Goals and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. We always regard private enterprises and private entrepreneurs as being in our ranks, giving them support when they are in difficulties and offering them guidance when they are uncertain about what to do. We should improve the development environment for private enterprises, remove the institutional obstacles that prevent them from fairly participating in market competition, and safeguard the property rights of private enterprises and the rights and the interests of private entrepreneurs according to law. We should substantiate the requirement that state-owned enterprises and their private counterparts should be treated equally through institutional arrangements and legal guarantee to encourage and support the development of the private sector and growth of private enterprises, and boost market expectations and confidence.It is necessary to give full play to the important role of private enterprises in stabilizing employment and boosting income, take more effective measures to support the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed individuals, and support the platform companies to play an active role in creating jobs, expanding consumption and competing in the global market. Work should be done to fully establish a cordial and clean relationship between government and businesses, and resolve concerns and difficulties for private companies and private entrepreneurs, so that they could be given a free hand and concentrate on development with no worries. It is also necessary to strengthen theoretical and political guidance, help private companies and private entrepreneurs properly perceive the Party Central Committee´s principles and policies of unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector, unswervingly encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector, as well as promoting the healthy growth of the non-public sector of the economy and encouraging those working in this sector to achieve success, so that they can let go of misgivings, be unburdened and develop with courage.Xi stressed that the pursuit of high-quality development places higher requirements on the private sector. Private enterprises should put into practice the new development philosophy, thoroughly understand the shortcomings existing in and challenges faced by the private sector, so that they can transform their growth model, adjust industrial structure and shift to new growth drivers, stick to the main business, strengthen their industries and consciously take the path of high-quality development. Those who have the ability and the conditions should strengthen self-dependent innovation to play a greater role in promoting sci-tech self-reliance and strength and the application of sci-tech achievements.Efforts should be made to unleash the vitality of private investment, and encourage and attract more private capital to take part in the development of major projects and programs in key industrial and supply chains, enabling such capital to make a greater contribution to fostering a new development pattern and promoting high-quality development. Work should be done to regulate and guide the sound development of all types of capital in accordance with law, and effectively prevent and defuse systematic financial risks, with the goal of creating an environment for enterprises under all forms of ownership to compete equally and grow together.Xi pointed out that Chinese modernization is meant to realize common prosperity for all Chinese people. Both state-owned enterprises and their private counterparts are important forces for promoting common prosperity. Both should take their social responsibilities in this regard. He called on private entrepreneurs to strengthen their sentiment and concern for the country and the people, and consciously apply people-centered development philosophy, and have a strong sense of responsibility and mission to help others get rich and promote common prosperity.Xi said that private enterprises should strive to build harmonious internal labor relations and foster an employees' community with shared interest, making sure that the achievements of private enterprises' development can equally benefit all staff members. He underlined the requirement that private enterprises and private entrepreneurs should adhere to the bottom line that their business operations must be in compliance with law and regulations, carry forward the fine spirit of entrepreneurship, and act as patriotic and dedicated role models who always abide by law in business operations, actively start up businesses while seeking innovation, and repay the society. Private enterprises and private entrepreneurs are called on to pass on and further develop traditional Chinese virtues, actively join in and initiate social charities, being responsible, righteous and benevolent while being wealthy.Shi Taifeng, He Lifeng, Hao Mingjin, Gao Yunlong and others were present.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218509.html,08,3,2023,usa,pdo

Yet in reality, its so-called competition means to contain and suppress China in all respects, and get the two countries locked in a zero-sum game,"" Qin said.He said the U.S. rhetoric of ""establishing guardrails"" and ""not seeking conflict"" simply means China should not respond in words or action when slandered or attacked. ""That is just impossible.""""If the U.S. does not hit the brake but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails could prevent derailing and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,"" Qin said.In response to a question about the Ukraine crisis, Qin said China chooses peace over war, dialogue over sanctions, and cooling down the situation over fueling the flames, calling for calm, reason and dialogue among the parties involved.China has not provided any weapons to either side of the Ukraine conflict and it always makes its judgments independently, based on the merits of the issue, he said.""There seems to be an invisible hand pushing for the protraction and escalation of the conflict,"" using the Ukraine crisis to serve certain geopolitical agenda, Qin said.Qin expressed China´s hope that Europe will achieve true strategic autonomy as well as lasting security and stability, saying China is willing to work with Europe to uphold ""true multilateralism"" and deepen their comprehensive strategic partnership.Concerning the United States' ""Indo-Pacific Strategy,"" Qin said its real purpose is to ""encircle China,"" warning that such an attempt will only disrupt the ASEAN-centered open and inclusive regional cooperation architecture, and undermine the overall and long-term interests of countries in the region.Qin said that China always treats Japan with goodwill and hopes for friendship and good-neighborliness. ""Yet, should some people from the Japanese side choose a beggar-thy-neighbor approach rather than pursue partnership, and even take part in a new Cold War to contain China, bilateral relations would only suffer new wounds when the old ones are yet to be healed,"" he said.Also during Tuesday´s press conference, Qin noted that developing countries account for more than 80 percent of the global population and more than 70 percent of global economic growth. ""People in developing countries are entitled to better lives, and developing countries are entitled to greater representation and a louder voice in international affairs,"" he said.Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang (2nd L, rear) attends a press conference on China´s foreign policy and foreign relations on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, capital of China, March 7, 2023. (Xinhua/Wang Yuguo)CHINESE PATH TO MODERNIZATIONAccording to Qin, Chinese modernization serves as an important source of inspiration for the rest of the world, particularly for developing countries.Qin said the Chinese path to modernization fits in well with China´s national conditions, and its success ""proves that every country has the right and ability to choose its own path and hold its future firmly in its own hands.""Chinese modernization is characterized by peaceful development and ""is not pursued through war, colonization or plunder,"" he said, calling it ""a new path different from Western modernization.""Qin said the right of every country to pursue a modernization path tailored to its national reality should be respected.The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a high-quality public good initiated by China, has benefited the world.Over the past decade, the BRI has brought nearly a trillion U.S. dollars of investment, established over 3,000 cooperation projects, created approximately 420,000 jobs in countries along the routes, and helped lift nearly 40 million people out of poverty.In response to allegations that the BRI can lead to debt traps, Qin said it is never China that should be accused of creating so-called debt traps, and that multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors account for over 80 percent of sovereign debt in developing countries.Qin expressed his belief that, as China accelerates high-quality development, promotes high-standard opening-up and fosters a new development paradigm, it will surely bring new opportunities to all countries in the world.CONFRONTING ""JACKALS, WOLVES"" HEAD ONAt the very heart of China´s core interests, the Taiwan question is the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and ""the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations,"" Qin said.Qin urged the United States to cease containing China by exploiting the Taiwan question, and to return to the fundamentals of the one-China principle.The real threats to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are the separatist forces seeking ""Taiwan independence,"" he said, noting that the one-China principle serves as a solid anchor and the three China-U.S. joint communiques serve as genuine guardrails.""Mishandling of the Taiwan question will shake the very foundation of China-U.S. relations,"" he warned.No country has the right to interfere in Taiwan affairs, as resolving the Taiwan question is China´s own business, he said, emphasizing that ""one should never underestimate the firm resolve, strong will and great capability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.""Responding to another question, Qin said that so-called ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy is just a narrative trap fabricated by those who either know little about China or its diplomacy, or have a hidden agenda that disregards the facts.""There is no shortage of kindness and goodwill in China´s diplomacy, but in the face of 'jackals or wolves,' Chinese diplomats have no choice but to confront them head on to protect the motherland,"" Qin said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218366.html,08,3,2023,usa,pdo

(Xinhua/Zhao Zishuo)STRONGER GLOBAL CONFIDENCEChina´s sound economic governance, modest growth target and promising development prospects have reassured the international community and injected elements of certainty into a world economy full of uncertainties, global observers have said.Ahead of the ""two sessions,"" such economic institutions as the International Monetary Fund raised their forecasts for China´s economic growth this year.China will better balance the relationship between quality and quantity of its economy and put quality first, said Australian economist Guo Shengxiang.""Global markets are taking China´s modest growth target in their stride, indicating that investors see merit in Beijing´s attempt to revive the world´s second-biggest economy without it overheating,"" said a report by Bloomberg.""Market watchers found elements that kept them upbeat, including China´s commitment to achieve high-quality growth without inflation-stoking stimulus,"" Bloomberg observed.Over the past three years, China has stepped up range-based, targeted and well-timed regulation, taking decisive measures to step up macro policy support while refraining from adopting a deluge of strong stimulus policies that would eat into the potential for future growth.Compared with some Western economies' U-turn in fiscal and monetary policies, China´s economic governance is more consistent and stable, Guo said, adding that China has helped stabilize market expectations.China´s rapid growth makes it not only one of the most influential countries in today´s international politics and economics but an inspiration to the developing world, said Anna Malindog-Uy, vice president of the Manila-based think tank Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute.Staff members work at a monocrystalline silicon solar cell factory of LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd. in Xi'an, northwest China´s Shaanxi Province, March 25, 2022. (Xinhua/Shao Rui)STRONG RESILIENCE WITH VIGOR""We continue to have high expectations for the Chinese market,"" Tetsuro Homma, executive vice president of Panasonic Corporation, told Xinhua.Despite the severe COVID-19 pandemic, Panasonic´s business in China achieved a double-digit growth consecutively in fiscal 2020 and 2021, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the group´s profits. ""It´s rare in other areas,"" Homma said.Over the past three years, China has managed to achieve an average annual growth of 4.5 percent, far exceeding the global average. During the ""two sessions,"" the Chinese government pledged to keep macro policy consistent and targeted, promote high-quality development and continue to advance win-win cooperation with other countries.Homma said Panasonic has a ""very solid growth plan"" for the Chinese market, and is expanding into new businesses in 14 cities, including building new factories, research and development (R&D) centers and marketing bases.The resilience of the Chinese economy is also reflected in the stability of prices. In 2022, global inflation reached its highest level in more than 40 years, while China´s consumer price index rose only 2 percent, much lower than that in the United States and major economies in Europe.Over the past five years, the added value of China´s high-tech and equipment manufacturing industries has grown at an average annual rate of 10.6 and 7.9 percent, respectively, and the digital economy is constantly growing.China´s innovation-driven development has not only promoted the transformation and upgrading of the Chinese economy, but also driven the localization and upgrading of foreign-invested enterprises.China´s economy is resilient and dynamic, said Jiang Ying, chair of Deloitte China, a well-known international accounting firm.""When foreign companies first came to China, they looked at China as a world manufacturing place and then set up R&D centers or put more value chains in China,"" Jiang said, adding that now comes the second wave of localization, with foreign companies bringing more advanced products or new products to meet the needs of Chinese consumers and stay competitive in the Chinese market.This photo taken on Nov. 5, 2022 shows a Tesla robot exhibited at the Automobile exhibition area of the fifth China International Import Expo (CIIE) at the National Exhibition and Convention Center (Shanghai) in east China´s Shanghai.

Last year alone, foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland, in actual use, reached a record high of more than 189 billion U.S. dollars.China has also established various platforms to share its development opportunities, such as the China International Import Expo, the China International Consumer Products Expo, and the China International Fair for Trade in Services.""We should, in accordance with the requirements of building a high-standard socialist market economy and promoting high-standard opening up, deepen reform in key areas, make coordinated efforts to put in place a modern infrastructure system and a high-standard market system, and steadily expand institutional opening up,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a deliberation with deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu Province at the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress.""China is promoting institutional opening up, which is very attractive to foreign-funded enterprises that are deeply engaged in Chinese market,"" said Liu Zhifei, president and general manager of Corning Greater China.Against the backdrop of rising protectionism, China has firmly supported multilateralism and promoted economic globalization.

Stop the war exercise.""They lay down on the street when a siren rang to do a ""die-in"" performance that was aimed at warning against the heightened war crisis on the peninsula ahead of the annual springtime war game, the demonstration organizer said.The protesters marched about 3.6 km in line to a plaza beside the Seoul metropolitan government building, where thousands more joined the protest rally.During the 11-day war game, the combined forces planned to stage a number of large-scale field training exercises, named Warrior Shield, that include a combined amphibious drill where as many as 13,000 soldiers would reportedly be mobilized.Seoul and Washington have insisted that the joint drill was defensive in nature, but the Democratic People´s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has denounced it as a dress rehearsal for northward invasion.""It raises tensions as the United States is carrying out the large-scale Korea-U.S. joint military exercise targeting the DPRK while mobilizing strategic weapons such as B-2 and B-52 (nuclear-capable bombers),"" Lee Jin-ho, one of the rally participants, told Xinhua.He noted that the war game involving the U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers will increase military tensions on the peninsula and in neighboring countries, warning that the South Korea-U.S.-Japan military alliance, which the United States was seeking to forge, could instigate war and encourage friction in East Asia.The peace rally and march were organized by Korea Peace Appeal, a campaign to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War by collecting 100 million signatures.The war between the two Koreas ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. Joining the campaign were over 370 South Korean civic and religious groups as well as over 70 international partner organizations.""The Korea-U.S. joint military exercise should be stopped immediately before it leads to a greater crisis. It is urgent to de-escalate military tensions and create dialogue conditions again,"" the organizer said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0313/c90000-10221376.html,13,3,2023,usa,pdo

Things to know about China´s role in the world (People´s Daily Online) 16:39, March 14, 2023The ""China threat"" idea has long been bandied about by US politicians trying to steal the spotlight from the media and the people. Will China become an actual threat to the world? Or by hyping up the ""China threat"", is the US simply finding an excuse to maintain its aggressive and hegemonic behavior? Here are facts that People´s Daily Online has collected.Foreign PolicyChina is the only country in the world that has pledged to ""keep to a path of peaceful development"" in its Constitution. The country pursues an independent foreign policy of peace. It does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs or export ideology, still less engage in long-arm jurisdiction, economic coercion or unilateral sanction. As a country that never engages in coercion or disinformation, China firmly opposes all forms of hegemony and power politics including attempts to blackmail, contain, blockade and exert maximum pressure. China has always been a force for world peace, a contributor to global development, a defender of the international order, a provider of public goods and part of the mediation efforts on hotspot issues.In contrast, the US, the world´s most powerful country after the two world wars and the Cold War, has acted repeatedly to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, pursue, maintain and abuse hegemony, advance subversion and infiltration, and willfully wage wars, bringing harm to the international community. US foreign policy has been built on one maxim：those who submit will prosper; those who resist shall perish. Instances of U.S. interference in other countries' internal affairs abound.

His proposal to the conference focuses on the better utilization of artificial intelligence in China´s research and education.""The next generation has to pick up emerging technological tools,"" Wai said.The 63-year-old has kept a forward-looking mindset not only in academic research but also when making life decisions.""I have always believed in the development of the nation and it turns out that I'm right,"" Wai said.Wai grew up as a child passionate about natural phenomena. In the late 1970s, when applying to university, Wai decided to study natural science while most of his peers with good grades would choose medicine.At the time, science and technology education was relatively undervalued in Hong Kong. According to Wai, there were just around 30 faculty positions in physics in the only two universities in Hong Kong then with around 5 million population. ""People said I wouldn't find a job after graduation,"" Wai recalled.In 1996, one year before Hong Kong´s return to the motherland, Wai came back from the United States after receiving a doctoral degree and working there for several years.""I thought the future lied in Hong Kong and I felt Chinese scientists would have better opportunities on our own land,"" Wai said.At the turn of the 21st century, higher education in Hong Kong developed rapidly and more universities came into being. Wai joined the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and spent 25 years there, teaching, conducting researching and later taking part in school management.Being the dean of the Faculty of Engineering and then vice president of the university, Wai worked to vigorously expand opportunities for scientific research at PolyU. He saw a future in tapping into the sci-tech development of the nation and helped researchers of PolyU build partnerships with various institutions in the Chinese mainland.Wai once played a leading role in facilitating the cooperation between a research team led by Yung Kai Leung, a PolyU professor in precision engineering, and the China Academy of Space Technology.Since 2010, PolyU has been contributing to the nation´s space projects and is by far the only tertiary education institution in Hong Kong with experience in international space missions.After more than two decades at PolyU, Wai transferred to HKBU, a university known for its humanities and fine arts education, and was appointed as the president.""Cultural soft power is just as important as hard science for national development,"" said Wai.The scientist said that stories about the deep and profound Chinese culture and the Chinese path to modernization are worth sharing with the world, noting that the humanities and arts disciplines have an edge in telling those stories.Working with his colleagues, Wai has been busy promoting the application of digital tools in humanities and arts education.From Wai´s perspective, Hong Kong is a highly international city, and young people in Hong Kong have an advantage in telling the China story to the world.""This is an opportunity that national development brings to Hong Kong´s youth,"" Wai said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0306/c90000-10217401.html,06,3,2023,usa,pdo

Since China is one of the largest economies in the world, this would have an important impact on the sectoral and geographical structure of global trade in the medium and long-term, the report said.China has seen a notable increase in demand for food manufacturing, as well as in the agriculture, textiles, health care and travel services sectors, the report said.Emerging Asian economies such as Cambodia and Vietnam, which export consumer goods to China, are therefore set to benefit the most in relative terms.Although the United States and the Euro area could see a moderate decline in their value-added exports to China, the U.S. agricultural and food manufacturing sectors are set to gain from the shift.Italy and France would gain from an increase in demand for food products, textiles, and leather products, as well as consumer chemicals. In addition, exports from Ireland and Spain to China could increase, boosted by demand for food products and other manufacturing and travel-related services, according to the report.The report was carried out by the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies, the Bank´s research institute specializing in emerging economies.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222675.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo

Commentary: Democracy shines through as China powers ahead on new journey - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: Democracy shines through as China powers ahead on new journey (Xinhua) 14:10, March 06, 2023BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- With a cabinet institutional reform plan, a new state leadership lineup, and policies concerning social fairness and justice for over 1.4 billion people on the agenda, all eyes are on China´s annual key political event, the ""two sessions.""The coming days will witness how these major decisions are made through a democratic process, ensuring transparency, accountability and representation for all.The annual meetings of the National People´s Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) bring together thousands of national legislators and political advisors.Their main objective is to align the interests and aspirations of the Chinese people with the development of the Party and the nation. With thousands of attendees, these meetings serve as a platform for meaningful discussion and collaboration, as participants work together to shape the future of China.Representing and addressing the diverse concerns of a country as large as China is no small feat. However, what is truly commendable is the country´s ability to foster consensus through effective communication and consultation.Unlike some Western countries where chaos and tensions caused by wrangling between political parties, polarization, or racial issues are common, the two sessions in China present a different picture.People attending this key political event witness a peaceful and unified gathering where diverse voices are heard and respected. Here, consensus is sought and common ground is reached through constructive dialogue, rather than being divided by partisan politics. The two sessions serve as a shining example of China´s commitment to promoting unity, harmony and progress for its people.As the Chinese leadership steers the nation through unforeseen circumstances and uncertainties in its development trajectory, the strength and vitality of China´s socialist democracy have become increasingly apparent.In the midst of current events and ongoing developments, this year´s two sessions hold particular significance.It is the first such event held since the Communist Party of China (CPC) unveiled its blueprint for building a modern socialist China in all respects for the following five years and beyond at its 20th National Congress last October.National legislators and political advisors will review the work of the central government, national legislature, supreme court, and top procuratorate. They will also deliberate on a draft amendment to the Legislation Law and engage in in-depth discussions to ensure that Chinese modernization sets sail with a detailed plan.DEMOCRACY FOR 1.4 BLN PEOPLEThe CPC has led the Chinese people in finding a new form of democracy that suits China´s national conditions, one that Chinese President Xi Jinping has described as ""the whole-process people´s democracy.""China´s whole-process people´s democracy includes election, consultation, decision-making, management and oversight. It distinguishes itself from the Western model of democracy which is often plagued by money politics, elite rule and political polarization.The newly elected 2,977 deputies to the 14th NPC, who serve a five-year term, come from diverse backgrounds. Nearly 17 percent are workers and farmers, including 56 migrant workers from rural areas; 15 percent are from ethnic minorities, representing all of China´s 55 ethnic minority groups; more than a quarter are women; and 21.3 percent are technical personnel.It is rare to see a high rate of representation of rural, blue-collar and ethnic minority individuals in the highest level of state power in Western countries such as the United States. This is because the democratic system in these countries tends to favor the elite capture of power rather than the well-being of the general population.Among the 2.62 million deputies to people´s congresses at the county and township levels, who were directly elected by over 1 billion voters on a one-person-one-vote basis, the proportion of workers, farmers, technicians and women is even higher.Deputies to the 13th NPC have voted on a range of crucial decisions and policies that have far-reaching significance: they have adopted constitutional amendments and the country´s first-ever Civil Code, and approved the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025).The CPPCC National Committee has held more than 70 consultative forums for specialists over the past five years, focusing on key issues including promoting the implementation of new childbirth policies. This has provided important references for the decision-making of the central authorities.TACKLING PRESSING PROBLEMSOver the past five years, the NPC deputies and national political advisors have filed over 70,000 suggestions and proposals covering various areas such as people´s livelihoods, social governance, modern economic systems, and green development.On the basis of their advice, China´s cabinet has introduced over 7,800 policy measures.For instance, Li Li, an NPC deputy who works in central China´s Hubei Province, put forth a suggestion for measures to resolve the difficulties faced by the elderly in going outside due to a lack of elevators in their apartment buildings. It has prompted the allocation of a huge amount of funds from the central budget to subsidize the renovation of old residential buildings nationwide, with 69,000 elevators newly installed.Democracy in China is an integration of the CPC leadership, the running of the country by the people and law-based governance, which is guaranteed by the effective implementation of democratic centralism, the fundamental organizational principle of the CPC and the principle of China´s state institutions as stipulated by the country´s Constitution.Under the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation led by the CPC, the CPC and non-communist parties work in cooperation with each other for the advancement of socialism, striving to improve people´s standard of living. The relationship maintains political stability and social harmony and ensures efficient policy-making and implementation.DELIVERING EFFECTIVE OUTCOMESThe ultimate goal of democracy is to ensure happiness for the people.In China, democracy is not reduced to empty slogans. Instead, it prioritizes addressing the most pressing issues faced by the people and meeting their aspirations for a happy life. These include better access to education, greater job security, more decent incomes, improved social security, enhanced medical and health services, more comfortable living conditions, and a cleaner and more beautiful environment.High-quality democracy in China has enabled the country to achieve rapid economic development and long-term social stability despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.China has remained the world´s second-largest economy with its GDP expanding at an average annual rate of 5.2 percent in the past five years, much higher than the global average.China´s life expectancy has reached 78.2 years and its per capita disposable annual income has more than doubled in the past decade. Over 13 million urban jobs have been created annually on average during the same period.There is no one-size-fits-all model of democracy, nor is there a single correct form for others to emulate. Democracy should not be privatized, labeled, or politicized.China´s socialist democracy is brimming with vitality as it reflects the will of the people, accords with the country´s realities, and enjoys the support of the Chinese people.China will never blindly copy other models of democracy, but rather make informed decisions based on its unique cultural, social and political context.Facts have demonstrated that preaching the idea of ""human rights above sovereignty"" and imposing democratic models on other nations have not yielded stability or prosperity. On the contrary, such approaches have led countries into chaos and disastrous crises.Now is perhaps the perfect time to champion an open and inclusive philosophy that puts people at the forefront, respects diverse models of democracy, and allows to live and let live.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0306/c90000-10217221.html,06,3,2023,usa,pdo
China's foreign ministry releases report on state of democracy in U.S. in 2022 - People's Daily Online,"China´s foreign ministry releases report on state of democracy in U.S. in 2022 (Xinhua) 13:02, March 20, 2023BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China´s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday released a report on its website titled ""The State of Democracy in the United States: 2022.""Based on facts, media comments and expert opinions, the report aims to present a real picture of American democracy over the past year.It reveals that American democracy was in chaos at home and that a trail of havoc and disasters were left behind as the United States peddled and imposed its democracy around the globe. It is hoped that the report will help remove the facade of American democracy for more people worldwide, the report says.In addition to the preamble and conclusion, the report has two parts titled ""American democracy in chronic ills"" and ""The United States' imposition of 'democracy' has caused chaos around the world.""In 2022, the vicious cycle of democratic pretensions, dysfunctional politics and a divided society continued in the United States, the report says, adding that problems such as money politics, identity politics, social rifts, and the gulf between the rich and the poor worsened.The maladies afflicting American democracy deeply infected the cells of U.S. politics and society, and further revealed U.S. governance failure and institutional defects, it says.However, the United States refuses to acknowledge the many problems and institutional crises confronting its democracy at home and stubbornly claims to be the template and beacon of democracy for the world. Such imperiousness perpetuates the ills of its democracy and causes dire consequences for other countries, says the report.Democracy is humanity´s common value. However, there is no single model of political system that is applicable to all countries in the world, says the report. It goes on to say that it should be up to the people of a country to judge whether the country is democratic or not and how to better promote democracy in their country. The few self-righteous countries have no right to point fingers.Those who have many flaws themselves have little credibility to lecture others, and attempts to undermine others for one´s own profit and destabilize the world must be unanimously opposed, says the report, adding that black-and-white division of countries as democratic or authoritarian is both anachronistic and arbitrary.What our world needs today is not to stoke division in the name of democracy and pursue de facto supremacy-oriented unilateralism, but to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and uphold true multilateralism on the basis of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, according to the report.It continues by saying that what our world needs today is not to interfere in other countries' internal affairs under the guise of democracy, but to advocate genuine democracy, reject pseudo-democracy and jointly promote greater democracy in international relations.What our world needs today is not a ""Summit for Democracy"" that hypes up confrontation and contributes nothing to the collective response to global challenges, but a conference of solidarity that focuses on taking real actions to solve prominent global challenges, the report says.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224703.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Chinese envoy refutes allegations of ""debt trap"" in Africa - People's Daily Online","Chinese envoy refutes allegations of ""debt trap"" in Africa (Xinhua) 19:35, March 15, 2023ADDIS ABABA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Xue Bing, Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Affairs of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Tuesday refuted the groundless cliche that China is creating a ""debt trap"" in Africa, calling it a narrative trap instead.Addressing media here in the Ethiopian capital, the special envoy said Africa´s debt burdens should not be blamed on China.Reports from international institutions and research show that African debt is mainly bonds held by Western private creditors. Xue said the distorted facts and truth prove that some countries are lying about the African debt issue.Data from the World Bank last year showed that among a total of 696 billion U.S. dollars in external debts in 49 African countries with accessible data, three-quarters are held by multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors, the lion´s share of Africa´s debts; while 35 percent are owed to Western private lenders, nearly three times of the total obligations to China, he said.While the cause of the debt crisis is multifaceted -- the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and excessive institutional lending -- Xue said the U.S. Federal Reserve´s rate hikes last year had harmed Africa.The special envoy said blaming China for the debt problems confuses the public and shirks responsibility.Since most debts of emerging and low-income countries are paid in a foreign currency, notably the U.S. dollar, irresponsible U.S. monetary policy escalated the debt problems of these countries, he said.While stressing the nexus between debt and economic and social development, Xue said if external debt contributes to a country´s economic and social development in the long term and can be adequately managed, it can be called good debt.Statistics showed that since the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was founded, he said, Chinese companies have built or upgraded more than 10,000 km of railways and nearly 100,000 km of roads and created more than 4.5 million jobs.In 2021, the trade volume between China and Africa surpassed 250 billion dollars. But according to official U.S. statistics, the value of U.S. exports to Africa was 26.7 billion dollars and 37.6 billion dollars for imports that year, both significantly lower than a decade earlier, Xue said.To help African countries reduce their debt burdens, China has actively participated in the Group of 20 (G20) Debt Service Suspension Initiative, signed debt suspension agreements or reached a consensus on debt relief with 19 African countries, and suspended the most debt service payments among G20 members, he said.China has also been actively engaged in the case-by-case debt treatment for Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia under the G20 Common Framework.In contrast, he said the largest creditors in Africa -- international private creditors and multilateral financial institutions -- are absent from the current debt relief actions.Xue noted that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once launched the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative to relieve the debts of heavily indebted poor countries, and the IMF provided 250 billion euros (268 billion dollars) to help respond to the European debt crisis.Xue stressed that they should be present in the debt relief actions in Africa. As the largest shareholder of the World Bank and the IMF, the United States should take responsibility and play a more prominent role. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222946.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo

Abbas, editor-in-chief of Arab News, in an article published on the website of the Saudi-based English language daily newspaper on Saturday, adding that it ""could be a true game-changer, heralding an era of regional peace and prosperity not seen in decades.""As Iran and Saudi Arabia are two powerful nations in the Middle East and the Muslim world, a peaceful and friendly relationship could bring more peace and stability to the region and the world, said Mohammad Reza Manafi, editor-in-chief for the Asia-Pacific news desk of Iran´s official news agency IRNA.""The move means a lot to both countries, as it will ease tensions between Shias and Sunnis,"" said Adnan Bourji, director of the Lebanese National Center for Studies.The reconciliation between the two regional rivals could set an example for other countries to follow in solving conflicts through dialogue, Bourji said.The ease of tensions will give Iran more room to handle repercussions of harsh sanctions imposed by the United States, while it will also calm the Saudi borders with Yemen, where Saudi-led coalition is engaged in a military conflict with Iran-backed Houthi militia, analysts say.Khaled Hamade, a Lebanese military analyst and retired brigadier general, told Xinhua that the China-brokered Saudi-Iran deal includes points related directly to the Yemeni crisis, such as the respect of other countries' sovereignty, and non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs.GOODWILL TO PROMOTE GLOBAL SECURITYWang Yi, who chaired both the opening and closing ceremonies of the Saudi-Iranian talks in Beijing, said the dialogue between the two countries in Beijing has ""become a successful practice for the strong implementation of the Global Security Initiative (GSI).""Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, presides over the closing meeting of the talks between a Saudi delegation and an Iranian delegation in Beijing, capital of China, March 10, 2023. (Xinhua/Luo Xiaoguang)The initiative, which was proposed by China in 2022, seeks to address the complex and intertwined security challenges with a win-win mindset.""We will continue to play a constructive role in properly handling hotspot issues in today´s world in accordance with the wishes of all countries and demonstrate our responsibility as a major country,"" Wang said.Analysts believe China´s successful hosting of the talks, which led to the breakthrough, highlights Beijing´s goodwill and endeavor to promote peace in the Middle East through political dialogue, as well as its efforts to advance the implementation of the GSI that seeks to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts and promote durable peace and development in the world.China´s successful mediation in the Saudi-Iranian deal proves that the world is open to an order characterized by multilateralism championed by China, instead of an order characterized by unilateralism the United States has enforced over the past decades, said Bourji.The Saudi-Iranian deal´s success has reflected the different approaches adopted by the United States and China in the Middle East, he added.""China handles (its diplomatic relations) in a spirit of friendship, persuasion, and the realization of mutual interests, while the United States handles (its diplomatic relations) in a spirit of imposition, hegemony, and ensuring American and Israeli interests at the expense of Arab dignity and interests,"" he added.The solutions proposed by China, which seek to solve international problems through mutual benefit, peaceful consultation, non-violent and non-military means, have gained more and more recognition around the world, said Dai Xiaoqi, professor at the School of Middle Eastern Studies of Beijing International Studies University.China´s ""balanced relations"" with both Saudi Arabia and Iran allowed it to accomplish the significant achievement, said Osama Danura, a political expert based in the Syrian capital Damascus.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0314/c90000-10221827.html,14,3,2023,usa,pdo

China's economic rebound sparks renewed spirit of confidence and hope - People's Daily Online,"China´s economic rebound sparks renewed spirit of confidence and hope (Xinhua) 08:35, March 07, 2023BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- As the wheels of life and labor spin back into motion at an accelerated pace, China´s economy is experiencing a splendid resurgence at the outset of the year.This year, in particular, is of immense significance for the world´s second-largest economy as it lays the groundwork for its future trajectory after the country achieved a decisive victory over COVID-19.Consequently, the annual ""two sessions"" -- or Lianghui -- which commenced over the weekend, ignited a palpable sense of excitement and optimism for the country´s future, as a series of development targets for 2023 were announced in a government work report.In a flourish of economic vitality, China has set an impressive gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of around 5 percent in 2023, and vowed to create around 12 million urban jobs and keep inflation at around 3 percent.HUMAN STORIES BEHIND ECONOMIC RESURGENCEFrom the captivating visuals on its streets to the promising financial projections and growth outlook, China has undergone a remarkable transformation since the country optimized its COVID-19 response. In fact, I had already sensed the rapid recovery of China´s economy in advance.The memories of December 2022 are still vivid in my mind as I made my way toward the Beijing Capital International Airport. I couldn't help but notice that the streets were almost vacant. The country was experiencing a sudden and massive spike in COVID-19 infections, and it seemed as though people had voluntarily chosen to remain indoors, despite the removal of most COVID-19 control measures.Fast-forward to February 2023, as I returned to Beijing after a blissful holiday, the roads were now bustling with the sounds and sights of people going about their daily lives, and the air was thick with the heady scent of possibility.This is the Beijing I am familiar with!China´s proposed annual growth target is more than just a figure; it encompasses heartfelt human stories. The owner of an eatery situated close to my home expressed her enthusiasm about reopening under optimized COVID-19 control.""I had been eagerly looking forward to welcoming my customers again,"" she exclaimed. ""I've missed them so much!""Another entrepreneur friend of mine, a young man who runs his own tech company, was thrilled at the prospect of being able to resume in-person meetings with clients and investors. ""It´s so much easier to build relationships when you can meet face-to-face,"" he told me when we recently met over coffee. ""I'm excited to be able to get back out there and make things happen.""Global institutions have heightened their projections for China´s economic revival. In January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) increased its estimate for China´s economic growth this year to 5.2 percent, up 0.8 percentage points from last October. The IMF cited China and India as the main drivers of global economic growth this year, a prospect that brings me great joy. Meanwhile, Moody´s, an international credit rating agency, anticipates that China´s economic resurgence may exceed expectations in the near term.Across China, small businesses and entrepreneurs are reporting a surge in demand for their products and services, as consumers eager to make up for lost time are once again venturing out into the streets.China holds a prominent position in the global economy as a major manufacturing hub and a vast consumer market. With a population of 1.4 billion, the country boasts over 400 million middle-income earners. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, consumption had been a significant contributor to the country´s GDP.The government work report emphasized the need to give priority to the recovery and expansion of consumption. Other key priorities include accelerating the modernization of the industrial system, deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises while giving the private sector and private businesses support, and intensifying efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment.DETERMINATION TO BOLSTER EMPLOYMENTChina´s economic recovery has continued to gather momentum, with its growth-focused policy pragmatism reviving job confidence.Due to various factors such as the severe impact of the pandemic, high unemployment rates have emerged as one of the most pressing issues in numerous countries, including my home country of India.However, it is quite evident that China has remained committed to generating employment opportunities despite the headwinds.As the country emerges from the pandemic, it will implement the employment-first policy and place a higher priority on the employment of young people, particularly college graduates, according to the government work report.China´s job seekers are reveling in the country´s economic resurgence and reopening. With a visible smile on her face and a glimmer in her eyes, a recent graduate described how she secured a highly sought-after job at a multinational corporation.""The past year has been challenging, with uncertainty and anxiety looming over our heads,"" she said. ""But with the country´s remarkable handling of the pandemic and the swift economic recovery, things are looking up. Companies are hiring again, and the competition is fierce, but I remained hopeful.""Her story is not unique. As one strolls through the bustling streets of Beijing, it´s impossible to miss the billboards that boldly advertise job vacancies and the recruitment booths that dot public places, reigniting hope and optimism among job seekers.China´s economic growth rate dropped to 3 percent last year, showing a slight deceleration, but the country´s underlying economic health remains robust. Notably, one of the highlights is stable prices. While global inflation has surged to its highest level in over 40 years, China´s Consumer Price Index (CPI) only rose by 2 percent in the context of 8 percent and above in the United States and the eurozone.This year, China´s CPI increase target is 3 percent. This goal reflects the country´s commitment to maintaining low inflation, fostering a stable environment for economic growth, and safeguarding the well-being of its people.High inflation has adversely affected the purchasing power of ordinary people in several countries, such as the United States, and in Europe. Nonetheless, in Beijing, the cost of my daily expenses has remained relatively stable over the past few years. For instance, the sandwich I have for breakfast every day still costs around 4 U.S. dollars, excluding delivery.CHINA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHIPS UP HOPE GLOBALLYMeanwhile, foreign businesses are setting their sights on China once again. Confidence is high and expansion plans are being made.The resurgence of the Chinese economy has garnered widespread global attention, igniting a fervor among international investors. The foreign direct investment, in actual use, expanded 14.5 percent year on year to 127.69 billion yuan in January, according to the Ministry of Commerce.Anecdotal evidence abounds of companies eager to take advantage of China´s vast and growing economy.An article on the website of the British ""Daily Telegraph"" stated that the Chinese market is ""one of the most attractive investment opportunities this year.""According to Yin Zheng, executive vice president of Schneider Electric´s China &East Asia Operations, China is not only a huge market but also a driving force for development and a source of innovation.Personal sentiments are similarly positive. Many executives and business owners express a sense of optimism, knowing that they can now move forward with their plans in China.One executive spoke of his excitement at the prospect of reopening the company´s office in Shanghai. ""We've been waiting for this moment for a long time,"" he told me. ""We're ready to hit the ground running.""Whether it´s a renewed focus on expanding into new markets, or simply the joy of being able to reconnect with colleagues and partners, there is a feeling that a new era of growth and opportunity has arisen.As an expat who has made China my home for several years, I'm breathing a sigh of relief and beaming with happiness, wishing to continue the life I have cherished in the country.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0307/c90000-10217517.html,07,3,2023,usa,pdo

(Xinhua/Chen Yichen)BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In 2017, Jilie Ziri, the first college student from the mountainous Abuluoha Village in southwest China´s Sichuan Province, decided to give up his job and return to his hometown.Serving as the secretary of the Communist Party of China´s (CPC´s) village branch, Jilie Ziri has led local residents in combatting poverty and pursuing a prosperous life. After years of efforts by Jilie Ziri and his fellow villagers, the once isolated town has been linked to the outside world with a paved road, and the people´s living standard has been greatly improved.Now, the young man, born in 1995 and from the Yi ethnic group, is in Beijing for the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC), where he and other deputies to the 14th NPC will discuss and decide how to bring a better life to the Chinese people.As global observers are closely watching the NPC and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), known as the ""two sessions,"" Jilie Ziri´s experience provides a personal perspective for them to better understand China´s whole-process people´s democracy.Deputies attend the opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 5, 2023. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu)POWER IN HANDS OF PEOPLE""I was following the two sessions last year. There was a driver who was one of the deputies appointed to sit in that body. There were delivery riders, farmers, teachers, cooks, doctors, journalists, who ordinarily will not make it to an institution where laws are made,"" said Eric Biegon, a journalist at Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. He was deeply impressed by the wide representation of the deputies.""What captures my attention when it comes to China and (its) politics is that (the Chinese) have chosen a path that tends to bring people at the center of decision-making,"" he said.When talking about China´s ""two sessions,"" many overseas observers like Biegon spontaneously mention broad representation, which features prominently in China´s whole-process people´s democracy. In their eyes, broad representation is a necessary requirement for ensuring that the people are the masters of the country.The 2,977 deputies to the 14th NPC make up a broad cross-section of people, with every region, ethnic group and sector of society having an appropriate number of representatives.In the new lineup, 497 deputies are workers and farmers, 634 technical personnel, accounting for 16.69 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively.The 2,172 members of the 14th CPPCC National Committee are from all of China´s 56 ethnic groups, and 60.8 percent of them are not CPC members.Zia Banday, senior research fellow at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, said deputies and members of the ""two sessions"" in China represent the interests of the people.They prepare for a long time each year, put forward opinions and suggestions, conduct deliberations and discussions, and provide ideas for national and people´s livelihoods. This unique model ensures that the ""two sessions"" can fully reflect the voice of the Chinese people, he said.The decision-making in the ""two sessions"" is open to all Chinese and friends who are interested in the overall development of the country, said Ronnie Lins, director of the China-Brazil Center for Research and Business and a senior expert on China´s decision-making mechanism.""I think the outcomes that China has achieved in recent years show that the process is broad in opinion and effective in results. The country´s economic and social achievements speak for themselves.""The opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC) is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 5, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhai Jianlan)FROM THE PEOPLE &FOR THE PEOPLEEvery year, topics discussed at China´s ""two sessions"" are always the focus of international attention.Development and people´s livelihood have always been important issues in China´s ""two sessions,"" fully reflecting the importance of ""the people"" in China´s socialist democracy, Patricio Giusto, director of the Sino-Argentine Observatory, told Xinhua.Last year, 92 changes were made to The Report on the Work of the Government based on the suggestions put forward by the NPC deputies and CPPCC members. Offices and departments under the State Council handled 8,721 suggestions from NPC deputies and 5,865 proposals submitted by CPPCC National Committee members, accounting for 94.8 percent and 95 percent of the total number of suggestions and proposals, respectively.Sommad Pholsena, vice president of the Lao National Assembly, pointed out that Chinese leaders not only communicate with the NPC deputies and CPPCC members during the ""two sessions,"" but also often conduct research at the grassroots level, which reflects that the thoughts and concerns of the Chinese people are at the heart of the CPC at all times.The CPC and the government have always given thoughtful and scientific policy responses to the people´s needs and appeals through collective thinking, he noted, saying that China´s whole-process people´s democracy integrates process-oriented democracy with results-oriented democracy, procedural democracy with substantive democracy, direct democracy with indirect democracy, and people´s democracy with the will of the state.Jean Christophe Iseux von Pfetten, president of the Institute for East-West Strategic Studies in Britain, was invited by the then mayor of Changchun to be a specially invited member of the CPPCC.As a long-time observer of China, Pfetten told Xinhua that through his personal experience, he found that China´s democratic practice is devoted to solving practical problems, as he witnessed how the local two sessions focused on addressing issues related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers. The China hand also participated in the discussion with his experience of working for the World Trade Organization.The NPC deputies and CPPCC members will review the government work report delivered at the beginning of the annual session of the NPC, and make amendments and put forward new proposals and new suggestions and make it a very useful document, said Muhammad Asghar, special correspondent of Associated Press of Pakistan in China.So, the ""two sessions"" are very important as they make policies and plans for the next year, said Asghar, noting that they implement all of the plans which are always very beneficial for the people.Pooling wisdom and seeking benefits for all, China´s rapid economic and social development and effective governance cannot be separated from the whole-process people´s democracy.The truth is that with this political system, China has done very well in terms of economic development and social welfare in general, and became the second-largest economy in the world, said Giusto, the Argentina expert.Aerial photo taken on April 28, 2020 shows a view of a poverty-relief relocation site in Nandan County, south China´s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

This is due to the unity of the Chinese people, together with the vision of the leadership of the Communist Party of China,"" said Chea Munyrith, president of the Cambodian Chinese Evolution Researcher Association.Recalling his visit to Xishuangbanna in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan, Munyrith said that ""I saw the spirit of development under the image of a united people force, which is a form of democracy with the Chinese characteristic. The development of villages is the decision of the people in the village and with the consultation and guidance of local CPC members.""""I have always admired and shared this picture with the villagers in Cambodia, and I have always talked with my government officials and friends in Cambodia about this good form of democracy,"" he added.The Chinese style democratic model adopts an approach featuring consultative democracy under the CPC leadership. Such a system, seeking to bring its people together for a common goal, proves to be a story of success and serves as an inspiring paradigm for other developing countries.The Chinese democracy has pulled 800 million people out of poverty and contributed to establishing infrastructure and health systems that benefit the Chinese people, said Asghar, the Pakistani journalist.""I think that the Chinese democratic system is becoming a model for so many countries,"" Asghar added.For Munyrith, who was once the head of the translation team for the Cambodian version of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China,"" what impressed him most about China´s democratic system is that the CPC has always put the people first.""As the ruling party, the Communist Party of China represents the interests of the people, and all policies put the interests of the people first,"" he added.Pointing out that there are various types of democratic system models, Pfetten emphasized that the Chinese socialist consultative democracy provides an elegant way of solving the antithesis between equality and liberty.The British scholar is writing a book on Chinese democracy, elaborating on the achievements of the Chinese democracy to readers based on his individual experience in China.Sommad Pholsena, vice president of the Lao National Assembly, said that the innovative proposal of whole-process people´s democracy demonstrates the self-confidence of the CPC, and offers fresh insights into the democratic building in other countries.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0306/c90000-10216893.html,06,3,2023,usa,pdo

However, we already have the commercial model ready to do so,"" said developer Leodanis Bernal, who works in Picta´s data architecture department.Both toDus and Picta are available from Apklis, Cuba´s app store, for Android mobile phones.The leader of the Apklis project, 31-year-old Yaiselis Ramirez told Xinhua they hope to make a significant leap in the coming years in terms of implementing new business models that favor both developers and the app store itself.Traditional ""app stores present some restrictions for Cuba for various reasons. Sometimes you have to use bank cards that are not issued by Cuban banks, which makes it impossible to distribute national apps,"" Ramirez said.In Cuba, more than 7.5 million people are connected to the Internet, and more than 80 percent of them connect via their mobile phones, according to data from Etecsa.Etecsa´s director of digital services, Hector Luis Mora, said that as part of the company´s alliance with UCI and the Havana Science and Technology Park, it will continue to supply the infrastructure needs of the data center and connectivity for different projects.""We want to achieve technological independence and contribute to the development of electronic government on the island,"" said Mora.""There will be no way to block Cuba´s digital development.

This has been proven by the world´s research progress in quantum physics and DNA at the start of the 20th century,"" he said.Wang noted that in order to pave the way for breakthroughs in developing 193-nanometer chips, leading US companies including Intel, Motorola and major labs joined forces to set up an alliance that provided funding and organized hundreds of scientists for feasibility research.""Then lithography machine giant ASML in the Netherlands succeeded in converting research and studies into products. So we can see that behind the breakthrough of developing the lithography machine is the major breakthrough in basic science research and specific areas such as mechanics, optics, electronics, automation and software,"" he added.Wang Guilin, deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of Jiusan Society and director of Guangzhou Science and Technology Bureau, noted that Xi said high-quality development is the primary task of building a modern socialist country in an all-around way, when delivering the report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last year.""High-quality development should be supported and led by science and technology,"" he said.As a developing country, to achieve its economic takeoff over the more than 40 years of its reform and opening-up the nation has adopted a typical path — achieving breakthroughs at three levels one after another: In production, technologies and science, he noted.By taking this path, China has grown to be a major player in manufacturing in the world, but this path is not enough to help the country become a major pioneering country in manufacturing ""because its basic science, which lags behind the existing pioneering countries, constitutes the bottleneck for achieving this major breakthrough"", he said.""To deal with this bottleneck, achieve high-quality development and become a real pioneering country in manufacturing, China has to take a reverse path: Effectively develop its scientific research, then give a push to its technology research and development, and then its high-end production sections,"" he added.Zhang Fulin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of Jiusan Society and director of the Political Participation Department of the Jiusan Society´s Central Committee, said that China, as a responsible major country, will surely reinforce basic science research to contribute Chinese wisdom for resolving the shared challenges and problems facing humanity.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0314/c90000-10221877.html,14,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Big data reveals differences of topics in China's local ""two sessions"" and U.S. Congress - People's Daily Online","Big data reveals differences of topics in China´s local ""two sessions"" and U.S. Congress (Xinhua) 15:50, March 06, 2023BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Big Data analysis by Xinhua News Agency of high-frequency words mentioned by legislatures and media since January 2023 has indicated the vastly different focuses of U.S. and Chinese lawmakers.Half a month in, the 118th U.S. Congress, convened on Jan. 3, was off to a sluggish start, with lawmakers dwelling on such topics as ""Biden,"" ""Trump,"" ""party,"" ""election,"" ""Russia,"" ""China,"" ""military"" and ""national security.""Data captured from more than 6,350 pieces of information, including reports from media outlets such as The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Guardian, as well as official releases, showed that ""Biden"" and ""Trump"" were almost equally important as hot topics, mainly due to a debate over an alleged voter fraud during the 2020 American presidential election.In comparison, Chinese local ""two sessions,"" which include meetings of its legislature and political advisory body at the local level at same period, discussed intensively ""development."" Other hot words also included ""economy,"" ""people,"" ""health care,"" ""green environment,"" ""education,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""democratic consultation,"" ""rural affairs"" and ""innovation,"" according to data captured from 3,170 related media reports in the first half of January.The tag cloud analysis above has indeed shed some light on what lawmakers in the two countries really care about.A clear difference is: throughout its lengthy meetings, the U.S. Congress did not mention ""people"" as much as a key topic, but spent much time on ""Russia,"" ""China,"" ""military"" and ""national security."" This stands as another example of Washington´s interests in war and inciting conflicts as opposed to China´s governing philosophy of prioritizing the people´s interests.Taking another close look at the U.S. Congressional sessions, the survey also finds that those lawmakers hardly stopped attacking each other or seizing each and every opportunity to shift blame. Discussions on issues such as ""health care,"" ""education,"" ""green,"" ""tax,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""climate,"" as well as ""Ukraine,"" ""technology,"" ""trade,"" ""energy"" and ""immigration"" all ended with partisan battles.Though both sides highlighted ""economy,"" U.S. lawmakers seem to concentrate on ""energy,"" ""trade"" and ""tax"" more specifically, while Chinese legislators tend to focus more on ""innovation,"" ""modernization,"" ""talent and education,"" ""technology,"" ""tourism"" and ""openness.""U.S. politicians have been using the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a bonanza for hegemonic pursuit when its own people are suffering the burden of high inflation. And in the trade war Washington waged against Beijing, it was the American people that paid for the additional tariffs imposed on the Chinese goods.Moreover, the tax cuts put in place by the previous U.S. administration have in fact allowed billionaires in the United States to pay less, which has further widened the wealth gap in the country. And the Democratic administration that tended to tax the wealthiest and the biggest corporations, has also failed to fulfill campaign promises.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0306/c90000-10217364.html,06,3,2023,usa,pdo

(Photo by Li Jianguo/Xinhua)Wilfred Daye, a veteran investor, expected the Federal Reserve to delay the hike of interest rates by one to two quarters as the banking sector is weak. He warned that a hike of 50 basis points by the Fed in its upcoming meeting in March would cause systematic shock to the economy and the unrealized losses in the U.S. banking sector would go higher.NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The recent fall of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank would have impacts on U.S. regulation, monetary policy, venture capital firms and start-up companies as well as foreign investors, according to a veteran U.S. investor.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could raise the ceiling of 250,000 U.S. dollars coverage for each account in case of a bank failure, said Wilfred Daye, chief executive officer and co-founder of Samara Alpha Management, LLC., a New York-based multi-strategy fund of funds and seeding platform.The limit of 250,000 U.S. dollars coverage per account has been in place for a long time, noted Daye.Daye expected the Federal Reserve to delay the hike of interest rates by one to two quarters as the banking sector is weak.Still, the Fed will continue to lift the terminal interest rate to around 5.25 percent as inflation is stubborn, said Daye in a recent interview with Xinhua.Daye warned that a hike of 50 basis points by the Fed in its upcoming meeting in March would cause systematic shock to the economy in the United States and the unrealized losses in the U.S. banking sector would go higher.U.S. banks were sitting on 620 billion U.S. dollars of unrealized losses in securities and other assets at the end of 2022 due to the rise of interest rates, according to the FDIC.The fall of SVB would have some spill-over effects with a few billion U.S. dollars of risk exposure with foreign investors, according to Daye.European banks could have the same problems facing U.S. counterparts as the European central bank needs to hike rates to tame inflation, said Daye.Customers wait inside a Signature Bank branch in New York, the United States, March 13, 2023. (Photo by Michael Nagle/Xinhua)U.S. venture capital firms and start-up companies would suffer from the collapse of SVB as it could take over one month for them to handle their banking account issue, according to Daye.The fall of SVB and Signature Bank also means opportunities for some investors as the share prices of some banks plunged earlier this week.A few hedge funds were looking to buy assets of regional banks with strong balance sheets and sound liquidity, according to Daye.Meanwhile, the money that had been invested in SVB and Signature Bank flowed into Bitcoin and Ethereum and drove up prices.Signature Bank was taken control by New York State Department of Financial Services on Sunday as a kind of preventive measure, said Daye.U.S. regulators' actions in regard to SVB and Signature Bank were decisive and right, helping build confidence, said Daye.If the U.S. federal government doesn't take action, more banks would face troubles, Daye added.SVB was shut down by U.S. regulators last Friday after the tech-focused lender reported massive losses from securities sales, which triggered a run on the bank´s deposits. It marked the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history and was quickly followed by the closure of cryptocurrency sector lender Signature Bank on Sunday.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0316/c90000-10223199.html,16,3,2023,usa,pdo
Experts slam US attempts to politicize origins of COVID-19 - People's Daily Online,"Experts slam US attempts to politicize origins of COVID-19By ZHANG ZHIHAO (China Daily) 08:33, March 15, 2023The United States' politicizing of efforts to trace the origins of COVID-19 will lead to more confusion and a protracted blame game, which will ultimately undermine the scientific process of discovering the cause of the worst pandemic in a century, experts said.Saturday marked the third anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a global pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter that understanding the origins of COVID-19 remains a scientific and moral imperative to help the world prevent future outbreaks.Last week, the journal Science published an article lamenting that science had taken a back seat at the first US congressional hearing on the origins of the novel coronavirus as US Democrats and Republicans engaged in a sparring match that shed no new light on the issue.""It was very disappointing, and almost unbelievably divorced from the science,"" Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Arizona, told Science. His published research in the journal, supporting natural ""zoonotic"" origins of the virus, has been attacked by proponents of the ""lab-leak theory"".Last month, the US Department of Energy changed its view about the likely cause of COVID-19 from ""undecided"" about its origins to suspecting a ""lab leak"" behind the pandemic. The view was based on a new classified intelligence report provided to the White House and key members of the US Congress.Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO´s technical lead on COVID-19, said on Twitter that she was frustrated that the US did not share additional information with WHO on its latest assessment of the virus' origins.""We don't completely have the answers to how this pandemic began, and it remains absolutely critical that we continue to focus on this,"" she said.Despite the Department of Energy claiming it had reached the new conclusion in ""low confidence"", the shift has reignited speculation and conspiracy theories regarding the origins of COVID-19.Since the start of the pandemic, some US politicians have frequently alleged that the virus was manufactured and escaped from a lab in Wuhan, Hubei province. China firmly opposed such speculations.Last week, the US Senate passed a bill requiring the declassification of information related to COVID-19 origins. However, the bill stated the reason for the disclosure as US politicians' belief that the virus had leaked from a Chinese lab.Despite investigations by WHO, global scientific communities haven't reached a definite conclusion on the virus' origins. But they generally lean toward favoring the spillover hypothesis, which says that the virus jumped from bats to humans.US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last week that the intelligence community has reached a broad consensus that the pandemic was not the result of a bioweapon or genetic engineering, though it is still undecided on the virus' origins.Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said the US has been ""politicizing, weaponizing and manipulating"" the efforts to trace the virus' origins to smear and attack China without providing evidence.China has always supported and participated in global science-based origins tracing of the virus, while firmly opposing political manipulation of the issue in any form, she said.Chinese scientists have shared vital data and made insightful discoveries with international peers on the origins of COVID-19.One example is a recent study by Mang Shi from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong province and Edward Holmes from the University of Sydney, Australia. They identified a bat virus, BtSY2, that is closely related to SARS-CoV, which caused a global outbreak in 2003, and SARS-CoV-2, the original COVID-19 strain, suggesting a history of recombination events that had taken place.The study, published on the preprint repository bioRxiv in November, revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of co-infection of viruses in bats.Recombination is a mechanism of coronaviruses that allows them to exchange genetic materials, leading to new genetic variants and traits. This study adds to the mounting evidence that the virus had originated from nature.On March 1, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao said the US putting its intelligence community in charge of a matter of science is a clear sign that the issue has been politicized. She said the US will not succeed in maligning China by rehashing its ""lab-leak theory"".""We urge the US to respect science and facts, stop politicizing the issue, stop its intelligence-led and politics-driven origins tracing, and stop undermining … global cooperation on science-based origins tracing,"" she added.In another media briefing on March 6, Mao said that China had contributed the most to the global COVID-19 origins-tracing efforts, and called on the US to be more transparent about its suspected early cases and the situations regarding its biolabs worldwide.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222403.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo
Commentary: Why Washington does not support ceasefire in Ukraine - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: Why Washington does not support ceasefire in Ukraine (Xinhua) 10:45, March 20, 2023BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Russia from March 20 to 22 at the invitation of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.Xi´s visit to Russia will be a trip of friendship, cooperation and peace, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Friday in a daily news briefing.He also reiterated China´s position on the ongoing Ukraine crisis, saying that ""China will continue to uphold its objective and just position on the Ukraine crisis and play a constructive role in promoting peace talks.""Surprisingly, or not, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded by saying that Washington opposed a possible call by China for a ceasefire in Ukraine because it would allow Russia to ""restart attacks.""No matter what the United States will do to defend its position, the international community can now easily see that Washington does not want to see an end to the conflict it has done so much to foster and escalate all along.Moreover, the United States is apparently not willing to see a political solution to the crisis, nor does it want to see that both sides can settle for peace.Although Washington always tries to portray itself as a sympathizer with the weak, that is certainly not who it is. The fact is that the United States, together with its allies, are piling up military assistance to Ukraine, and would rather let the conflict-torn Ukrainians continue to suffer from the bloody crisis until their last drop of blood is spilled than put a stop to the conflict.It might seem cold-blooded and even self-contradictory. Yet if take a deeper look into why it is so, you can find that the United States as a matter of fact takes the crisis as a business in which it can make a big fortune.To be more specific, Washington, by prolonging the conflict, can weaken Russia and force Europe to further rely on the United States in security matters so that it can consolidate its hegemony. Plus, it can also profit enormously from the crisis. The recent news claiming that the United States was responsible for explosions of the Nord Stream pipelines can tell so much.According to the latest data from market research firm Kepler, in the context of the escalating crisis in Ukraine, natural gas transmission channels of Russia-Europe pipelines have been restricted, and the demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the EU has surged.Specifically, the EU´s LNG imports from the United States increased by 23.59 million tons compared with 2021, a year-on-year rise of 154 percent.The world has suffered terribly because of an egoistic and self-serving United States. Because of the conflict, the Ukrainians have lost hugely; the Europeans are dragged into a quagmire, and the world is being forced to be separated along an ideological divide. Moreover, the food, energy and financial crises the conflict has triggered continue to wreak havoc.Now it is increasingly clear that to pursue its self-interests, Washington can do anything, like stalling peace efforts and opposing a ceasefire. To be a responsible major country, the United States should stop being the destroyer of peace and creator of crises, shift to the right side of history, and help bring this disaster to an end.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224663.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo

Bush and his top officials publicly uttered at least 935 lies about the threat that then Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein posed to the United States, the article said on Tuesday, citing the Center for Public Integrity.The U.S.-led invasion not only destroyed Iraq, but it displaced some 9 million people, killed at least 300,000 civilians by direct violence, and devastated Iraq´s already precarious environment, it said.The invasion also destabilized the region and is a leading cause for today´s global migration crisis, it said.The number of people displaced by all post-9/11 U.S. wars, at least 38 million people, exceeds the total displaced by every war since 1900, except World War II, it said, citing Brown University´s Costs of War project notes.The Iraq war ushered in a style of politics where truth is, at best, an inconvenience, it said.The world is still reeling from the consequences of these lies and the institutions built on them, it added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0317/c90000-10223920.html,17,3,2023,usa,pdo
UN watchdog chief's visit raises hopes of reviving Iran nuclear deal - People's Daily Online,"UN watchdog chief´s visit raises hopes of reviving Iran nuclear deal (Xinhua) 09:47, March 10, 2023TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The visit to Iran last week by the UN nuclear watchdog chief following weeks of high tension between the two sides seemed to have witnessed the calm after the storm, reflecting a bilateral willingness to resolve issues and raising hopes of reviving a 2015 nuclear deal, Iranian analysts said.Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, the capital of Iran, during March 3-4 and discussed issues of contention with senior Iranian officials.The outcome of the trip was a joint statement by the two sides, the main features of which were their pledge to continue interactions ""in a spirit of collaboration"" and Iran´s greater openness to the agency´s inspections.""NEW CHAPTER OPENED""""A new chapter was opened in the cooperation between Iran and the agency,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Monday, two days after Grossi finished his visit.Describing Grossi´s visit as part of the efforts to pave the way for all parties' return to the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Kanaani expressed hope that the ""good agreements"" reached during Grossi´s trip would prepare the ground for the resolution of technical differences.The visit came amid the differences between Iran and the IAEA that had peaked in previous weeks, mainly over claims that Iran ""enriched uranium to a level close to 84 percent"" and its ""noncooperation"" with the agency with regard to the ""three undeclared sites"" where ""traces of uranium"" had allegedly been found. Iran rejected the first claim as ""inaccurate"" and the second as ""baseless.""It is worth noting that Grossi´s visit came after months of criticisms by the agency of ""Iran´s lack of cooperation"" and a few days ahead of a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, where in November last year, a resolution proposed by the United States, Britain, France and Germany had been passed calling on Iran to collaborate with the agency´s investigators regarding ""uranium traces,"" all said to be among the outstanding issues causing a standstill in the nuclear negotiations that started in Vienna in April 2021.Despite some skepticism voiced domestically of the trip and the intentions behind it, the visit drew upbeat responses from Iranian officials, media, analysts and especially the country´s forex market where the national currency, the rial, started gaining against the U.S. dollar after days of unprecedented depreciation.RESOLVING DIFFERENCESIn remarks to the official news agency IRNA, Jalil Rahimi Jahanabadi, a member of the Iranian Parliament´s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said Grossi´s visit was mainly a ""political"" one aimed at alleviating the agency´s concerns about Iran´s nuclear activities and reassure the West that Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon.He expressed optimism that the visit would prepare the ground for the closure of the case about Iran´s nuclear activities for good.Remarks by Grossi on the sidelines of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting on Monday seemed to support the optimism, as he said no ""production"" or ""accumulation"" of highly enriched uranium has been found by the agency´s inspectors in Iran.When the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors came to an end on Wednesday, no anti-Iran resolution was issued despite the hue and cry by the E3 group of France, Britain and Germany as well as Israel over the past weeks.During his meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on Saturday, Grossi described as ""very constructive and positive"" his meetings with Iranian officials during the visit, saying they will prepare the ground favorably for future interaction and expanded cooperation between the two sides.At a joint press conference earlier in the day with President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Mohammad Eslami, Grossi stressed that the cooperation between the agency and Iran and the ""good agreement"" the two sides were expected to reach would be of contribution to the JCPOA´s revival.RESUMING NEGOTIATIONS?Reza Nasri, an international affairs analyst, told the semi-official ILNA news agency that the differences between Iran and IAEA were cited as the main obstacle to the continuation of the negotiations.At present, Iran has proved that it is not the side to blame for the failure to resume the nuclear talks, he said, noting Tehran can use the ""technical agreements"" with the agency as important political leverage in the process of reviving the JCPOA, waiting for the other parties to keep their side of the bargain.On the possibility of Grossi´s visit resulting in the JCPOA´s revival, Javid Qorban-Oghli, former Iranian ambassador to South Africa, told Iranian Ham-Mihan newspaper that unless Iran and the IAEA resolve their differences, it will not be possible to restore the nuclear agreement.""I do not seek to say (the visit) will lead to the JCPOA´s revival, but when Grossi points to such a possibility, it is a positive sign,"" the former diplomat said.An analysis by the official Iranian newspaper Jomhouri-e Eslami (Islamic Republic) was another upbeat voice heard following Grossi´s visit, as it said what took place during the IAEA chief´s trip has increased the likelihood of the JCPOA´s revival.""It appears that the recent agreements reached between AEOI and IAEA would be enough to help resolve the disputes between the two sides for the time being, ... thus smoothing the path for the resumption of the nuclear talks,"" the newspaper said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219803.html,10,3,2023,usa,pdo
UN chief proposes Emergency Platform to help tackle global shocks - People's Daily Online,"UN chief proposes Emergency Platform to help tackle global shocks (Xinhua) 08:49, March 10, 2023UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday proposed strengthening the international response to complex global shocks through an ""Emergency Platform.""The global response to such shocks is often ad hoc, fragmented, and improvised. There is a need for a mechanism to tackle multidimensional threats with a multidimensional response, he said in his presentation of a policy brief for the Summit of the Future scheduled for 2024.""Our global interconnectedness means that shocks that occur in one country or sector can quickly have cascading consequences elsewhere, often in unforeseen ways. Those shocks are coming at us with greater strength and frequency, with serious implications for peace and security, economic stability, and environmental sustainability,"" he said.Those shocks can have a disproportionate impact in some areas. Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the global cost-of-living crisis hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest, throwing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) progress and Agenda 2030 further off-track, he added.For the sake of a more formal, predictable, and structured approach, the Emergency Platform would leverage the United Nations' convening power and capacities in a timely and predictable way. It would identify and bring together actors at the appropriate level to respond. It would be flexible and agile, responding to different types of shocks. Crucially, it would promote a global response based on solidarity and equity, and the key principle of leaving no one behind. All people and countries hit by a shock must have access to the support they need, said Guterres.Accountability would be built into the Emergency Platform, in order to hold all parties to their concrete commitments, he said.While decisions would continue to lie with member states, the Emergency Platform would also include the private sector, civil society, and other non-state partners with an ability to contribute to the global response.But he clarified that the Emergency Platform would not be a standing entity or body. It would, instead, consist of a set of protocols around convening key actors in the event of complex, global shocks, and operationalizing their coordinated response.The Emergency Platform would not displace or duplicate the work of intergovernmental bodies, including the Security Council. Nor would it interfere with the mandate of specialized agencies or existing mechanisms. It would be a tool for the multilateral system to support intergovernmental decisions and complement existing mechanisms, he said.The United Nations is the only organization that can bring together all stakeholders in the event of complex global shocks, and has them work together to the best effect. It is time to take decisions that enable it to do so, said the UN chief.Another policy brief presented to UN member states by Guterres concerns how to take the future into account in decision-making and deliver on responsibilities to generations yet to be born.""Achieving the SDGs, upholding the rights and meeting the needs of people alive today are clearly preconditions for a better future. At the same time, we must make those decisions with an eye on the future, recognizing the rights and interests of people who are not yet born,"" he said.Most members of future generations will be born in countries that are currently low- and middle-income ones. They are likely to live in places that are already suffering the effects of poverty, hunger, the climate crisis, crippling debt, discrimination and inequality. The policy brief makes it clear that a secure and equitable future starts now, he said. ""Considering the future pays off in the present.""The policy brief proposes three concrete steps at the global level.First, it proposes the appointment of an envoy who will be the global voice for future generations, raising awareness about the impacts on them of the decisions that are taken today.Second, it proposes ideas to inform a political declaration defining duties to the future. This would be an opportunity to consolidate the commitments already made to future generations and to adapt these commitments to new challenges.Third, it proposes a dedicated intergovernmental forum, where member states could advance the commitments in the declaration and share experiences and innovations. The brief, therefore, recommends the establishment of a Commission on Future Generations as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly.""These first two policy briefs start our contribution to the consideration by member states of the decisions and changes needed to equip the multilateral system for the challenges of today and the future,"" said Guterres.Nine more policy briefs for the Summit of the Future will be published by July.The goal is simple: to breathe new life into the multilateral system so that it can deliver on the promises of the UN Charter and the 2030 Agenda, he said. ""As our world becomes more complex, more uncertain, and more dangerous, we have an even greater responsibility to strengthen the multilateral system.

China urges Japan not to arbitrarily discharge nuclear-contaminated water - People's Daily Online,"China urges Japan not to arbitrarily discharge nuclear-contaminated water (Xinhua) 13:55, March 07, 2023VIENNA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese officials on Monday urged Japan not to arbitrarily start discharging nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station into the Pacific Ocean.Liu Jing, deputy director of the China Atomic Energy Authority, told a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors that Japan´s nuclear-contaminated water discharge plan is not the country´s private matter, but concerns the global marine environment and public health.Liu said the IAEA has neither completed its assessment of Japan´s disposal plan nor drawn specific conclusions, and all its three reports published so far pointed out the plan´s non-compliance with the agency´s safety standards and suggested improvement.However, Japan has arbitrarily approved its own plan and expedited the construction of discharge facilities, ignoring the authoritative advice from the IAEA and the opposition from both home and abroad, Liu said, calling Japan´s move ""an extremely irresponsible act that has drawn grave concerns from the international community and relevant countries.""Noting that China supports the IAEA´s work on Japan´s discharge plan, the Chinese nuclear official said he hopes the agency will continue to perform its duties in an objective and impartial manner, listen to the opinions of stakeholders, strictly implement the agency´s safety standards and international good practices, and help the international community ensure absolute safety.Liu stressed that Japan´s plan to dump contaminated water into the ocean is not the only feasible way of disposal, and Japan should not use the assessment from the IAEA technical task force as a free pass on its discharge plan.He urged Japan not to distort the reports of the IAEA task force to justify its discharge plan, nor ignore the authoritative suggestion from the task force, nor set a deadline for the release of the task force´s final assessment report.Noting that the disposal of the contaminated water will span a long time and involve many uncertainties, he said that Japan should allow effective international supervision on the water disposal, address the legitimate concerns of its neighbors and Pacific island countries, and hold meaningful consultations with stakeholders.Li Song, China´s permanent representative to the United Nations in Vienna, also decried Japan´s ""extremely irresponsible act"" of pushing ahead with its discharge plan despite international opposition.Li urged Japan to respond to the concerns of the international community and refrain from arbitrarily discharging contaminated water into the ocean.Such water disposal is a highly controversial issue that needs to be seriously and prudently addressed by the international community and IAEA member states, the Chinese envoy said.Instead of endorsing Japan´s discharge plan, the IAEA should maintain its scientific, impartial and transparent approach and lead the establishment of a long-term international monitoring system that involves laboratories and experts from China and other stakeholders, he said.China will participate in the relevant work of the IAEA with a strong sense of responsibility, Li said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0307/c90000-10218018.html,07,3,2023,usa,pdo

In 2015, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission appointed by the Canadian government concluded that children were physically and sexually abused and died in the schools in numbers that may never be fully known.Tzay said the Commission´s Calls to Action should be fully implemented.

Despite comprising 7.7% of the Canadian population, over 53% of children in care are indigenous, up to 90% in some provinces,"" he said.Tzay said intergenerational trauma caused by residential schools and structural racial discrimination has led to a number of present-day human rights violations and abuses, including the current crisis concerning missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. It is estimated that Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women in Canada.""The number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to increase,"" the expert said.

He called on the Canadian government to prevent and combat such violence as a matter of priority, by addressing the root causes of the MMIWG ""epidemic"", including systemic racism and discrimination against Indigenous women and girls.The special rapporteur also expressed concern that Indigenous Peoples have continued to be overrepresented in the criminal justice system.""The situation of Indigenous women and gender diverse peoples is even more devastating as they represent half of the federal prison population,"" Tzay said. ""Indigenous Peoples are often victims of racial profiling, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, and disproportionate use of force by law enforcement personnel.""People visit a memorial at the site of the former St. Paul Indian Residential School in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on Aug. 10, 2021.

US urged to stop slandering TikTok - People's Daily Online,"US urged to stop slandering TikTokBy FAN FEIFEI (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:45, March 17, 2023China urged the United States on Thursday to stop spreading false information on data security issues and unreasonably suppressing related companies, as Washington had yet to provide evidence that Chinese-owned short video platform TikTok threatened US national security.The US government should provide an open, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for companies from all countries to invest and operate in the US, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a daily news briefing.Wang made the remark after The Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources as saying that the administration of US President Joe Biden has demanded that TikTok´s Chinese parent company ByteDance sell its stakes in the popular video-sharing app or face a possible US ban on the app.China always holds that the data security issue shouldn't be a tool that some countries leverage to generalize the concept of national security and abuse state power to suppress companies from other countries, Wang said.""We remain confident that the best path forward to addressing concerns about national security is transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting and verification, which we are already implementing,"" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday.""If protecting national security is the objective, a ban or divestment doesn't solve the problem, as neither option solves the issues of data access or transfer,"" the company said, adding that a forced sale won't resolve national security issues.Bai Ming, deputy director of international market research at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said the US uses the ""national security threat"" as an excuse to contain the rise of Chinese companies, which completely deviates from the principle of fair competition in a free market.""Such practices will not only affect the normal business activities of Chinese companies in the US and violate their legitimate interests, but also harm the rights of US consumers, given that TikTok has gained wide popularity among the country´s younger generation,"" Bai said.Late last month, the White House required all US federal agencies to remove TikTok from their phones and systems within 30 days, and Canada announced that it is banning TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices.Li Yong, deputy head of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, said that the US government uses political measures to crack down on Chinese companies operating in the US, which is a kind of hegemony that severely damages TikTok´s corporate image and reputation, and also violates international economic and trade rules.TikTok has announced it will spend $1.5 billion on a plan known as ""Project Texas"", in a bid to bolster data security through storing US-based user data in the servers of US tech company Oracle.It also announced a series of new measures last week to strengthen the protection of user data in Europe. These measures include further enhancing controls on access to user data by introducing security gateways that will determine employee access to European TikTok user data and data transfers outside of Europe.The company also plans to build its second data center in Ireland, and another in Norway. Last year, TikTok established its first European data center in Dublin, Ireland. All of these data centers will be co-location sites operated by third-party service providers, the company said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0317/c90000-10223653.html,17,3,2023,usa,pdo

""With its imagination and stunning visual effects, it displays the infinite charm of sci-fi movies and conceptions to the fullest.""Gao Ang, art director of ""The Wandering Earth II,"" said that the film used many more scenes and props than ""The Wandering Earth.""""We hope to complete the task of 'depicting the future world' in the framework of 'historical documentary' through greater information density,"" Gao said of the team´s purpose in making the movie.The preparation, shooting and post-production lasted more than 1,400 days. It involved 5,310 conceptual-design drawings, more than 950,000 prop and costume items, and over 4,000 visual-effects shots.After watching the movie, some audiences said they were impressed by those elements featuring science and technology, including space elevators and quantum computers. However, they said they sometimes mistook sci-tech props for visual effects.The Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd. (XCMG), a leading Chinese heavy machinery manufacturer, is among the providers of the movie´s props.Feng Ruoyu, director of the company´s ""The Wandering Earth II"" project, said the filming is a process that the directors imagine and the people from XCMG implement. To facilitate the filming, the XCMG has provided 61 sets of equipment, such as the ET120 walking excavator, and more than 400 sets of parts, all free of charge, Feng added.""When we see the equipment, we think our imagination cannot keep pace with reality,"" said Guo, the series director. ""The reason we have such confidence in making science fiction films is that there are already such technologies in real life.""He said that people often see news on such things as Chinese astronauts conducting extravehicular activities and probes landing on the moon, and so they can be convinced of the scenes presented in sci-fi movies.Guo added that scientific and technological progress has provided a realistic basis for sci-fi literature and art, while economic development has provided a sizeable cultural consumption market for sci-fi creation.In February, the 2022 China sci-fi industry report was launched, jointly developed by the Beijing-based China Science Fiction Research Center and the Research Center for Science and Human Imagination under the Southern University of Science and Technology in south China´s Guangdong Province.According to the report, in 2021, the total revenue of China´s sci-fi industry was 82.96 billion yuan (about 12 billion U.S. dollars), up 50.5 percent year on year, maintaining steady growth.Wu Yan, a professor at the university, said the sci-fi-related policies and awards have been introduced and implemented, and various films and videos have been launched, bringing opportunities and confidence for the development of China´s sci-fi industry.""The Wandering Earth II"" has earned over 4 billion yuan at the box office, according to box office tracker Maoyan.

Yet hardly any media reported the incident until 10 days later, on which day the scene of a journalist being taken away by the police on site was shown to the public.It is such selective reporting that makes people wonder whether there is really any freedom of the press in the West.Similarly, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, in which the US plays a major role, published a report on its official website criticizing China for ""travel restrictions"".The FCCC´s complaint about ""travel restrictions"" during the COVID-19 pandemic is risible. It is common sense that when a major public health threat emerges, every member in a society contributes to the fight against it by sacrificing some convenience to travel. These restrictions in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic applied to everyone. There is no reason for foreign correspondents to expect any exemption.

According to official data, about 3,000 journalists have registered to attend this year´s two sessions, of which over 1,000 come from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and foreign countries.The fact that foreign reporters can freely do interviews at the sessions of China´s top legislative body and top political advisory body is best evidence against the FCCC report. The FCCC said they want to ""tell the China story well"", and China welcomes foreign journalists who do that.

And the ongoing ""two sessions"" provide a window.Observers in many countries said that with an independent foreign policy of peace and a mutually beneficial strategy of opening-up, China has always contributed to world peace and development.FOR WORLD PEACE""Peaceful development as emblematic of China´s international cooperation has seen Beijing welcomed in many countries around the world,"" said Cavince Adhere, a Kenya-based international relations scholar.Currently, a myriad of factors, including geopolitical conflicts, bloc confrontation and terrorism, are posing challenges to global peace and stability. The world pays more attention to China´s insights into how to stave off security dilemmas and achieve lasting peace.""China´s commitment to peace is historic since the appearance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,"" said Eduardo Regalado, senior researcher at the International Policy Research Center of Cuba.China has always been for peace and dialogue.

"""Two sessions"" muster consensus, strength for China's modernization drive - People's Daily Online","""Two sessions"" muster consensus, strength for China´s modernization drive (Xinhua) 08:09, March 13, 2023BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- For any China observer, the ""two sessions"" provide a chance not to be missed to get a glimpse of how its grand blueprint for modernization turns into policies and actions.With development and reform priorities reviewed and discussed by over 5,000 national lawmakers and political advisors ranging from farmers to state leaders, the annual meetings of China´s top legislature and political advisory body serve to build up consensus and pool strength for the country´s modernization drive.An all-important political event, this year´s ""two sessions"" took place after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) last October, which has laid out major policies and strategic plans for building a modern socialist country in all respects.From common prosperity to high-quality development, the vision of the CPC and the will of the people converge at the Great Hall of the People on the action plan for modernization.Employees work at an intelligent truck plant in Changchun, northeast China´s Jilin Province, Jan. 31, 2023. (Xinhua/Xu Chang)PROSPERITY FOR ALLAn array of development tasks for 2023 were mapped out in a government work report that was submitted to the national legislature for deliberation, focusing on steady and quality growth for the Chinese economy.The report unveiled a target for the Chinese economy to expand by around 5 percent this year, faster than the 3-percent growth recorded in 2022. Other objectives include creating around 12 million urban jobs, consumer price index increasing around 3 percent, and personal income rising generally in step with economic growth.The national legislature on Friday approved a plan for reforming the institutions of the State Council, which focuses on optimizing and adjusting the responsibilities of institutions to enhance the capacity and efficiency of governance.While these moves will all make a difference in advancing China´s modernization, the most challenging tasks remain in rural areas, which are generally less developed than the cities.Dong Jianxin, Party secretary of Yuangudui Village in Dingxi, Gansu Province, said an affluent life, prosperous industries, an environment desirable to live in, and a stable and safe society full of goodwill were his vision of modernity.Yuangudui was one of the 128,000 villages nationwide that had been removed from China´s poverty list since 2012 thanks to its vigorous fight against poverty.Contributing his wisdom to China´s bid to revitalize the countryside, Dong, also a national lawmaker, put forward suggestions at the ""two sessions"" on attracting talent to rural regions and boosting rural tourism.This aerial photo shows workers conducting routine cleaning along a river in Dongheng Village of Deqing County in Huzhou, east China´s Zhejiang Province, April 12, 2022. (Photo by Wang Zheng/Xinhua)China should foster rural industries with local features to create more channels for increasing rural incomes and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation to prevent large-scale relapse into poverty, according to the government work report.Chinese modernization is the modernization of common prosperity for all, said President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, when participating in a joint group meeting of national political advisors on Monday.In the eastern province of Zhejiang, a demonstration zone aiming to basically achieve common prosperity by 2035, local authorities are trying out various programs to narrow urban-rural income gap and ensure that no one will be left behind amid China´s modernization drive.Zhang Tianren, Party secretary of Xinchuan Village in Changxing County of Zhejiang, is leading villagers to develop rural tourism, leisure agriculture, and a homestay economy, shifting from a reliance on resource-intensive industries that brought about environmental damages.To achieve common prosperity, targeted efforts must be made to foster industry clusters and chains, said Zhang, also a national lawmaker.

One eye-catching move in the country´s reform of State Council institutions is to restructure its Ministry of Science and Technology to better allocate resources to overcome challenges in key and core technologies.The reform also includes setting up a national data bureau to coordinate the integration, sharing, development and application of data resources, a key asset in a modern economy.Building self-reliance and strength in science and technology is key to building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects within the set time frame, Xi said when attending a deliberation with lawmakers from Jiangsu Province during the ""two sessions.""In its pursuit of high-quality development, China is trailblazing a new path of seeking harmony between humanity and nature.To embrace green development, China´s top political advisory body set up a new sector on the environment and resources this year to pool wisdom for the country´s transition to a more eco-friendly and sustainable path.This photo taken on March 1, 2023 shows black-necked cranes in Lhunzhub County of Lhasa, southwest China´s Tibet Autonomous Region.

""I look forward to working with my fellow advisors to contribute to promoting harmony between humanity and nature,"" he said.The role of the private sector in pursuing high-quality development is highlighted. The government work report pledges ""encouraging and supporting the private sector and private businesses in growing and expanding.""Private firms should take the initiative to pursue high-quality development, Xi said while attending Monday´s joint group meeting of national political advisors, stressing that private enterprises and entrepreneurs ""belong to our own family.""""The Party and the government remain committed to supporting the private sector. Neither the direction nor intensity of supportive policies has changed,"" said Liu Yonghao, chairman of China´s agricultural conglomerate New Hope Group and a national political advisor.Private enterprises can contribute largely to the development of Chinese modernization, said Wang Yu, board chairman of Spring Airlines and a national political advisor.""With strong confidence in the overall stable business environment, companies will expand investment and explore new markets, and entrepreneurship will be effectively stimulated, fully unleashing market vitality and driving forces for development,"" said Wang.Deputies to the national legislature make up a broad cross-section of people, with every region, ethnic group and sector of society having an appropriate number of representatives. The national political advisors also come from diverse backgrounds. They all have one common aspiration: to bring the largest-scale modernization in human history into reality.This year, Chinese lawmakers submitted over 8,000 suggestions to the legislative session, while some 5,400 proposals had been put forward by national political advisors to the advisory session as of March 5. The suggestions and proposals covered a wide range of issues such as development of the real economy, pollution control, and accessibility to high-quality medical resources.Xi has urged solidarity in the face of profound and complex changes in both international and domestic landscapes, noting that it is the source of strength.""Only when all the people work together with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and have the courage and ability to carry out our fight, will we continue to win new and greater victories,"" said Xi.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0313/c90000-10221010.html,13,3,2023,usa,pdo

All options are served with a mushroom soup base.The chain plans to expand further by opening a total of six overseas stores this year in Singapore and Malaysia.Chinese restaurant businesses are accelerating their expansion plans in foreign markets. Large chains and smaller-sized brands are targeting Southeast Asia — particularly Singapore — as well as North America.Such expansion has shifted from targeting overseas Chinese to attracting local customers. It has also transitioned from small-scale fragmented operations to specialized and network-based businesses with local supply chains, reflecting the growing popularity of Chinese cuisine and the global appeal of the nation´s culture.Coucou, another Xiabuxiabu hotpot brand, launched in Singapore a year ago. For many Chinese restaurant businesses, Singapore is their first choice for overseas expansion, as the city state has a sizable Chinese population and a multicultural society that enjoys different types of cuisine.Taier Chinese Sauerkraut Fish opened its first overseas store at Changi Airport in Singapore in August 2021, while Meow Barbecue launched its first store on foreign soil in Singapore in September.Tanyu, a restaurant chain focusing on roasted fish, has opened five stores in Singapore. Li Xiaoshuai, a spokesman for Tanyu´s franchise expansion, told Chuhaitimes, a news website covering Chinese companies exploring foreign markets, that when choosing a location. The main consideration is whether it fits the company´s customer base of overseas Chinese, including students.Dishes offered by Tanyu feature flavors popular in China, giving overseas Chinese a taste of home.Li said that for financial reasons, more than half the materials used by Tanyu´s Singaporean outlets are imported from China through third-party channels, including kitchen utensils. Fish, the core ingredient, is sourced from Vietnam.Tanyu´s stores in Singapore operate in a franchise system and are managed by local teams. Li said the company´s headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, arranges online training to maintain consistency with its food produced in China.Annual revenue from a single Tanyu outlet is about 19 million yuan ($2.74 million), and Li said the business plans to expand to 10 to 20 overseas destinations in the next two to three years.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0316/c90000-10223233.html,16,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Xi's Russia visit to navigate bilateral ties, boost global stability - People's Daily Online","Xi´s Russia visit to navigate bilateral ties, boost global stability (Xinhua) 09:29, March 20, 2023BEIJING/MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping´s upcoming state visit to Russia, his first foreign trip since being re-elected as Chinese president, will be a trip of friendship, cooperation and peace.The visit, scheduled for March 20-22, is set to map out the blueprint for the development of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era. It will also push ahead with the practical cooperation between the two countries, and inject strong impetus into the endeavor to maintain peace and prosperity so as to jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind.MODEL FOR MAJOR-COUNTRY RELATIONSHIPEarlier this month, footage of Chinese panda named Ruyi went viral online, which showed him playing and gorging himself on fresh bamboos in Moscow Zoo. Ruyi and his buddy Dingding officially moved to their new home in Moscow during a grand ceremony attended by Xi and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in June 2019.During that visit, the two leaders signed and issued a joint statement raising bilateral ties to the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, opening up a new chapter in China-Russia relations featuring higher level and greater development.Visitors look at giant panda Ruyi at the Moscow Zoo in Moscow, capital of Russia, July 31, 2022. (Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)Now Xi is about to set foot on Russian soil for the ninth time as Chinese president. Over the past decade, the two heads of state have met with each other on some 40 occasions. Their frequent and high-quality exchanges have always been guiding the development of China-Russia relations.The past years have witnessed the steady growth of China-Russia ties with the inking of a host of important documents such as a joint statement on win-win cooperation and deepening their comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in 2013, the China-Russia Joint Statement on a New Stage of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2014, a 2015 joint statement on deepening comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination and advocating win-win cooperation, and the China-Russia Joint Statement on Further Deepening the China-Russia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2017.In 2021, the two presidents commemorated the 20th anniversary of the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between China and Russia and made the decision to extend the pact.As the world is facing profound changes unseen in a century and the unprecedented pandemic, Xi and Putin have maintained close contact through various means, including a meeting during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, traditional year-end online talks, calls and messages, and participating via video link in the ground-breaking ceremony of a bilateral nuclear energy cooperation project and other major events held in their respective countries.Under the joint leadership of the two heads of state, the bilateral partnership has grown more mature and resilient.This photo taken on Dec. 2, 2019 shows the joining part of the first highway bridge connecting China and Russia across the Heilongjiang River. The bridge across the Heilongjiang River stretches from Heihe, a border city in Heilongjiang Province, to the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk. (Xinhua/Wang Jianwei)As an ancient Chinese saying goes, ""True partnership defies geographical distance."" China and Russia have blazed a trail in the growth of major-country relations featuring strategic trust and good neighborliness, setting a good example for a new type of international relations.Meanwhile, China-Russia ties are based on non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party. The relations pose no threat to any other country in the world, nor are they subject to interference or provocation by any third party.Russia and China have set an example for relationship between major countries, said Vasily Kashin, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of Russia´s National Research University-Higher School of Economics.""Russia-China relations, which are efficient, responsible and future-oriented, have played a stabilizing role in international affairs,"" he said.NEW CHAPTER IN COOPERATION, FRIENDSHIPIn June last year, the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge over Heilongjiang River opened to traffic. The new channel, a milestone in infrastructure connectivity, has connected China´s northeast and Russia´s far east amid booming economic and trade cooperation between the neighbors.Two-way trade has been growing over the past decade, surging from less than 90 billion U.S. dollars in 2013 to more than 190 billion dollars last year and approaching the target of 200 billion dollars set by the two heads of state.Exports of automobiles and spare parts from China to Russia have increased rapidly in recent years. By the end of last year, the number of automobile dealers of Chinese brands in Russia had climbed to 1,041.Meanwhile, chocolates, honey, flour, and alcohol -- quality Russian products as such have become more widely available for Chinese customers. The Russian Export Center, the country´s state institution for export support, has announced an increase in the number of online shops in a bid to let Chinese customers have easier access to quality Russian products.While the all-round bilateral practical cooperation is flourishing, people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries are also thriving, which have built up popular support for China-Russia friendship.Currently, the two peoples are marking the 2022-2023 years of sports exchanges after the youth friendly exchange year, media exchange year, subnational cooperation and exchange year, and scientific and technological innovation year.Russia and China have carried out cooperation actively under the guidance of the two heads of state in the past 10 years, said Yuri Tavrovsky, a professor of the Russian University of Peoples' Friendship, who expects that the leaders of the two countries will open up more new areas for bilateral cooperation in the future.FOR EQUITY AND JUSTICEBack in 2013, Xi chose Russia as the destination of his first overseas trip after becoming president. In his speech at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations during that visit, Xi called for building a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation at the core, stressing the mankind ""has increasingly emerged as a community of shared future in which everyone has in himself a little bit of others.""The vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind not only reflects the common voice of all peoples and gathers the broad consensus of the international community, but also leads the trend of the times and the way forward for mankind. Since it was proposed, the notion has been enshrined repeatedly in important documents of the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and other multilateral mechanisms.""Ten years have passed, and we understand that the notion´s relevance has not decreased but is becoming more and more important,"" said Anatoly Torkunov, president of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, who applauded Xi´s speech at the scene in 2013.The world has now come to another historical crossroads.To revert to a Cold War mentality, provoke division and antagonism, and stoke confrontation between blocs, or to act out of the common good of humanity to promote equality, mutual respect and win-win cooperation -- the tug of war between these two trends is testing the wisdom of statesmen in major countries as well as the reason of the entire humanity. Facts have repeatedly proven that containment and suppression is unpopular, and sanction and interference is doomed to fail.At the critical moment in human history, Xi has made the important judgment that ""the world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century,"" while Putin has also made similar assessment at the Valdai Discussion Club.The more turbulent the world is, the more steadily China-Russia relations should forge ahead.As the founding countries of the SCO, both sides have pushed forward multilateral cooperation, and extended the organization´s focus from security to politics, economy as well as people-to-people and cultural exchanges. They have made joint contributions to a better world order, global and regional development, as well as the security of the SCO members.A China-Europe freight train heading for Moscow departs from Mafang railway station in Pinggu District of Beijing, capital of China, March 16, 2023. (Xinhua/Ren Chao)Under the BRICS mechanism, Beijing and Moscow, together with other members, have played an active role in advancing the reforms of the global economic governance, and jointly created a stronger voice on major international and regional issues. Those efforts have enabled the emerging economies and developing nations to have more of a say on the world stage. And the developing economies, represented by the BRICS countries, have become the new engine of economic globalization in today´s world afflicted by rising populism and protectionism.China and Russia, as permanent members of the UN Security Council as well as important parties of the Group of 20, APEC and other key global and regional groups, have also worked closely on issues related to the situation in the Korean Peninsula, Afghanistan, as well as the Iran nuclear issue. They have played a leading role in promoting multipolarity and greater democracy in international relations and safeguarding global strategic balance and stability.Ten years on, China will continue to work together with Russia to follow the trend of the times, drive global unity and cooperation and contain division and confrontation so as to make new and greater contribution to peace and development of humanity.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224550.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo
Unresolved issues haunt Japan-S. Korea rapprochement - People's Daily Online,"Unresolved issues haunt Japan-S. Korea rapprochement (Xinhua) 09:09, March 20, 2023TOKYO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol here on Thursday. The two leaders agreed to normalize bilateral relations that had been strained over the wartime labor and other historical issues, and resume the shuttle diplomacy of regular leader visits.Yoon´s visit came just 10 days after South Korea unveiled a proposal to compensate the victims of Japan´s forced wartime labor through a government-backed foundation funded by private-sector donations, which has triggered strong backlash at home.Analysts believe that the Japan-South Korea rapprochement is largely manipulated by the United States to serve its strategic interests, adding that it is difficult to bridge the huge gap between the two countries as there are still many unresolved issues.The relationship between Japan and South Korea in recent years has been considered the worst since the end of World War II, with the biggest thorn being the wartime labor issue.The Yoon government announced its plan on March 6 to compensate the victims, who were forced by the Imperial Japan into heavy labor without pay during World War II, through a foundation funded by voluntary donations from the South Korean private sector, rather than direct payment by Japanese companies held accountable.On March 16, Kishida and Yoon reached consensus on restarting the bilateral summit meeting and the dialogue on security and economy.However, in South Korea anger has flared up over the government´s ""humiliating"" compensation plan. According to a recent poll conducted by Gallup Korea, nearly 60 percent of South Koreans oppose the so-called third-party reimbursement plan as it contains no apology and reparations from Japan.South Korea´s opposition political parties and civic groups have raised their voice against the government´s solution to Japan´s wartime forced labor issue. Lee Jae-myung, chief of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, lambasted Yoon´s proposal, calling the deal ""secondary harm to the victims"" and ""a humiliation and stain in diplomatic history"".On the day Yoon left for Japan, university students held a rally in front of the presidential office in Seoul, calling the government´s proposal ""an insult to the youth"".Apart from Japan´s wartime forced labor issue, there are a series of other pending problems between the two countries such as the issue of ""comfort women"" and territorial disputes.In December 2015, the South Korean and Japanese governments reached an agreement to settle the issue over Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery under the 1910-45 Japanese colonization of the Korean Peninsula. The Japanese side decided to offer 1 billion yen (8.9 million U.S. dollars) to a foundation to help the former ""comfort women"" and their families.However, the foundation was dissolved in July 2019 under harsh criticism from the victims and civic activists who demanded sincere apology and legal responsibility of the Japanese government.The then Japanese government under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had refused to do it.Analysts said that the U.S. has played an important role in the process of repairing ties between Japan and South Korea, hoping to draw in its two allies and strengthen trilateral cooperation in military, economy and other fields to serve its ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"".Japanese scholars pointed out that the ""closer ties"" between Tokyo and Seoul under the manipulation of the U.S. will not gain public support, and the differences between the two countries can not be bridged easily, noting that the development of bilateral relations is not an easy road.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224518.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo
There is no shortage of kindness and goodwill in China's diplomacy - People's Daily Online,"There is no shortage of kindness and goodwill in China´s diplomacyBy He Yin (People´s Daily) 08:47, March 16, 2023In response to the initiative of President Xi Jinping of China´s support for developing good neighborly relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, delegations of the two countries recently held talks in Beijing.In a joint statement released with China, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to reopen their embassies and diplomatic missions within two months, hold talks between their foreign ministers on the arrangement of ambassadors' exchange, and explore ways to improve bilateral ties.The Saudi-Iranian agreement to restore diplomatic relation was hailed by Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, as ""a victory for dialogue and peace"" and has been widely welcomed worldwide.The kindness and goodwill in China´s diplomacy are reflected in the country´s efforts to expand all-round diplomacy in a coordinated manner and to build a new type of international relations. China has had a growing network of friends, made more and more new friends, and strengthened ties with old ones.China has never and will never invade or bully others, or seek hegemony. The country will take it as its mission to defend its core interests. It firmly opposes any form of hegemonism and power politics, and firmly opposes the Cold War mentality, camp-based confrontation, and acts to contain and hold back other countries' development. It will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests.The kindness and goodwill in China´s diplomacy are reflected in the country´s efforts to promote common prosperity of the world with its own high-quality development.Recently, the Chinese path to modernization has become a hot topic around the world. Chinese modernization offers solutions to many challenges facing human development. It busts the myth that modernization is westernization; it creates a new form of human advancement; and it provides an important source of inspiration for the world, especially developing countries.China hopes and believes that as more and more countries begin their own journey of modernization, the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind will become true.China´s development benefits the world and China cannot develop in isolation from the rest of the world. Amid rising unilateralism and protectionism, China will solidly promote high-level opening up, not only making good use of the global market and resources to develop itself, but also promoting common development of the world.The kindness and goodwill in China´s diplomacy are reflected in the country´s efforts to firmly uphold and practice multilateralism and actively improve global governance.Through the past ten years, Xi has put forward a host of major initiatives and proposals, including building a community with a shared future for mankind, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the common values of humanity, the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative. The core message of these initiatives is that countries are interdependent, mankind have a shared future, and the international community must get united for cooperation.China believes that global governance should be promoted in accordance with the law and the principles of international law enshrined in the UN Charter; equity and justice must be upheld while hegemonism and selfish interests must be rejected; solidarity must be defended while division and confrontation must be abandoned.People in developing countries are entitled to a better life, and developing countries are entitled to greater representation and a louder voice in international affairs.China will take multilateralism as the way forward. It will promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, promote greater democracy in international relations, and make global governance more just and equitable. It will offer more, better Chinese insight and solutions to help meet humanity´s common challenges.This year, China will follow the guidance of head-of-state diplomacy. It will ensure the success of the two major diplomatic events that the country will host at home- the first China-Central Asia Summit and the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which will be the showcase of the distinctive character of China´s diplomacy.The first China-Central Asia Summit is expected to mark the latest practice of China to build an even closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future.Ten years after its inception, the BRI has laid down a pathway toward common development, and created an array of national landmarks, livelihood projects, and milestones of cooperation. It has brought nearly $1 trillion of investment, established over 3,000 cooperation projects, created some 420,000 jobs in countries along the routes and helped lift nearly 40 million people out of poverty.As global development faces severe challenges, the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will promote high-quality development of Belt and Road cooperation and inject new impetus into building a community with a shared future for mankind.The new journey of China´s diplomacy will be an expedition with glories and dreams, and it will also be a long voyage through stormy seas. China will continue to pursue the independent foreign policy of peace, and will continue to implement the mutually beneficial strategy of opening up. China will always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. It will keep writing new chapters in its distinctive major-country diplomacy in the new era. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0316/c90000-10223123.html,16,3,2023,usa,pdo

Bamboo export paves road to wealth for mountainous village - People's Daily Online,"Bamboo export paves road to wealth for mountainous village (Xinhua) 10:11, March 17, 2023A visitor tries a bamboo bicycle at the environmental services exhibition during the 2022 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 3, 2022. (Xinhua/Li Xin)GUANGZHOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The sight of clusters of tall bamboo drying in the sun serve as an inspiration for 48-year-old Tan Futing´s pursuit of prosperity.Tan hails from Manchang Village, Hedong Town, located in Lianshan Zhuang and Yao Autonomous County in south China´s Guangdong Province. The village is known for its abundant production of Lizhu, a type of slender bamboo ideal for making fishing rods, ski poles, fences, and other products due to its straightness and sturdiness.The bamboo goes through a process that involves washing, drying, screening, grading, cutting, lashing, and packing. After that, it is boxed and shipped to overseas markets, where bamboo culture is appreciated for its humble, firm and indomitable spiritual connotation.As early as a decade ago, Huang Changkuan, the Party secretary of Manchang Village, led the villagers to start a bamboo business using the Lizhu variety. The business mainly involves processing the cut bamboo and shipping them to export companies for sale in overseas markets.""Our bamboo sticks are thinner and harder with better elasticity than those in other regions, making them a preferred choice of export companies,"" Huang said.Every year, during the winter thaw and the slack farming season, it is the felling period of Lizhu bamboo. The processing factory´s small warehouse quickly fills up with hundreds of tonnes of bamboo freshly cut and processed by villagers.""I've worked here for three years. The timing of farming and bamboo processing is just staggered, so I can earn two shares of money a year. Thanks to this additional income, I was able to add a new floor to my building last year,"" said Tan Futing, adding that he can earn more than 200 yuan (about 28.9 U.S. dollars) a day by cleaning bamboo, which amounts to more than 5,000 yuan a month, resulting in a net increase in income of 20,000 yuan annually.It is recorded in the local county annals that Hedong Town is known for its abundance of bamboo. In 1931, Li Yongsheng, a businessman, came to Hedong to establish the Nanhai Yongsheng Bamboo Factory. He purchased a large quantity of bamboo and sold it abroad, which led the locals to realize the value of the bamboo growing in the mountains. As a result, almost every family began to venture into the mountains to gather bamboo, resulting in the growth and prosperity of the bamboo business.Today, Hedong exports thousands of tonnes of bamboo to the United States, the Netherlands, Japan and other countries every year. As a commodity, there is a growing international demand for bamboo, leading to an increase in its price.""Last year, our village sold 1,300 tonnes of raw bamboo to export companies, and the price of bamboo rose from 25 yuan per 100 kilograms a decade ago to 50 yuan now. The villagers have become rich with bamboo,"" Huang said.Although the villagers rely on bamboo to boost their income, they exercise moderation in its use.The frequency and timing of cutting bamboo matter. The old bamboo can regenerate new shoots and even grow more lush than before, as long as its roots are not damaged, Tan explained, adding that the sustainability of the villagers' income is contingent on the preservation of the green hills.""Going ahead, our village should accelerate the industrialization of bamboo, expand the scale of the factory, and strive to make villagers earn more for better life,"" Huang said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0317/c90000-10223805.html,17,3,2023,usa,pdo

Director of the U.S. National Intelligence Avril Haines on Wednesday noted that there is not a consensus among the U.S. intelligence community on whether or not the outbreak is a result of a lab leak or natural exposure to an infected animal. Besides, Polish virologist Agnieszka Szuster-Ciesielska recently said in an interview that the COVID ""lab leak"" theory rehashed by the U.S. Department of Energy and FBI is sensation-seeking and has no factual or scientific basis.For some time now, the United States has been politicizing, weaponizing and instrumentalizing COVID origins-tracing for many months, Mao said, adding it has let a matter of science be dominated by lawmakers and the intelligence community and spread myths such as the ""lab leak"" theory without any evidence to discredit and attack China.""This has seriously poisoned the atmosphere for science-based global origins-tracing and been perceived by people in the rest of the world,"" she said.Noting China´s position on the origins-tracing is consistent, Mao said China has supported and participated in global science-based origins-tracing since day one.""In the meantime, we have been firmly opposed to all forms of political manipulation on this issue,"" Mao said, adding the political manipulation by the United States is the main stumbling block to the science-based research on COVID origins.Mao said the United States has been pointing fingers at WHO´s origins-tracing process, politically punishing scientists with conscience and attacking countries with lies that make no scientific sense.Pointing out that the United States has done nothing responsible on origins-tracing, Mao said it has never invited WHO expert groups to the United States for joint research or shared any early data on COVID origins and it has turned a deaf ear to the world´s concerns about U.S. bio-military bases at Fort Detrick and around the world.Politicizing origins-tracing would only hamper science-based cooperation on the issue, disrupt solidarity against the virus, and undermine global health governance mechanisms, Mao said.""We once again urge the U.S. side to immediately stop political manipulation on this issue, respond to the world´s legitimate concerns, voluntarily share the data of suspected early cases in the United States with the WHO, disclose information about its bio-labs at Fort Detrick and around the world, and give the rest of the world the truth it deserves,"" she added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219633.html,10,3,2023,usa,pdo

Major events can promote global prosperity - People's Daily Online,"Major events can promote global prosperityBy Zhang Yunbi (China Daily) 08:48, March 08, 2023[Photo/Xinhua]Experts say forums on BRI and other issues will promote stable and safe interaction. A series of planned major events high on the schedule of China´s diplomacy at home — especially one to celebrate the Belt and Road Initiative´s 10th anniversary — will further convince the world of the country´s sincerity and policy consistency in terms of opening-up to the outside world and bolstering global prosperity, veteran officials and scholars told China Daily.These policy insiders are attending the annual two sessions in Beijing as members of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the country´s top political advisory body.In recent months, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have confirmed that China will work with various parties to host a major diplomatic event this year — the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.They said China is willing to take the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative as an opportunity to look back and build on the BRI´s achievements, draw up a blueprint and further advance its high-quality development with the attendees.President Xi Jinping first proposed the two most important components of the Belt and Road Initiative — the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road — in 2013.The first and second Belt and Road Forums for International Cooperation were held in Beijing in 2017 and 2019, respectively, bringing together dozens of foreign heads of state, government leaders and chiefs of key international organizations, such as the United Nations.Some countries have already responded positively to news of this year´s Belt and Road forum.During a meeting last month, Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron, told Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, that France is willing to earnestly participate in the forum.China has already signed more than 200 cooperation documents with 151 countries and 32 international organizations to build the BRI, doubled its trade in goods and increased its direct investment in countries along the initiative´s routes by 80 percent.ZHANG YUJUN/FOR CHINA DAILYPoverty alleviationAccording to a 2019 World Bank report, ""BRI transportation projects could help lift 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty"" (those earning less than $1.90 a day), and ""32 million people from moderate poverty"" (less than $3.20 a day).Gu Xueming, president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing and a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, said, ""The Belt and Road Initiative originated in China, but the opportunities and results it has brought belong to the whole world.""He added that looking back on the past 10 years, BRI construction has maintained great vitality, and the initiative has responded to the needs of the times via China´s role and contribution.Gu cited the example of a Chinese company that invested in a pharmaceutical factory in the West African country of Mali under the China-Africa Public Health Plan. With the start of mass production at the factory, Mali not only ended its history of reliance on imported drugs but also significantly reduced the price of medication in its home market. At the same time, the factory gave rise to the development of upstream and downstream industries, Gu said.""When we are looking ahead, the prospects are bright and the tasks are mounting. This requires substantial efforts in BRI construction, more Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions, and a high level of China´s opening-up in order to build a community with a shared future and improve global governance,"" he added.Hu Sishe, former vice-president of the Chinese People´s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, said it is necessary to further improve person-to-person contacts between China and countries along BRI routes.He called for full play to be given to the role of existing friendships between Chinese and foreign sister cities, along with more sister city exchanges and cooperation under the context of the BRI to build a solid foundation for exchanges at the local level between China and participating countries.""I recommend piloting more dialogue and exchanges with historic and cultural cities along BRI routes, in particular dialogue and exchanges with those in Europe and in West Asian and North African countries, thus boosting the resonance and common language with countries along the routes,"" he said.Prospering togetherWhen he met with a South Korean entrepreneur in Beijing last month, Liu Jinsong, director of the Foreign Ministry´s Department of Asian Affairs, said that in addition to the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, China will host the annual Boao Forum for Asia and the China-ASEAN Expo this year.""These major events will provide important platforms for China to deepen exchanges and cooperation with other countries"", and ""businesses from Asian countries are enjoying multiple enabling factors in their cooperation with China"", Liu was quoted as saying in a news release on the Foreign Ministry´s website.Chinese officials and scholars said opening to the outside world is a win-win situation for both China and its foreign partners, and by China spreading its arms and reach to the world, both sides enjoy many mutual benefits.From 2001 to 2021, the first 20 years after China´s accession to the World Trade Organization, the country´s total economic output rose from sixth largest in the world to second largest, and it has become a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, according to the Ministry of Commerce. Between 2013 and 2021, China´s annual contribution to global economic growth averaged 38.6 percent, larger than the combined contribution of the Group of Seven countries.Although the global economy has continued to suffer from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the past year, major international exhibitions such as the Canton Fair and the China International Import Expo were held as scheduled, providing highlights amid the global economic downturn, experts said.Yang Guangbin, a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and dean of the School of International Relations at the Renmin University of China, said, ""Instead of taking a winner-takes-all approach, China is sincerely committed to building the Belt and Road together in order to promote the common development of countries along the routes.""China has proved its ability by co-founding the buildup of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the community with a shared future for humanity it advocates is also an approach to adjusting the established world order that features some inequalities. China has become an important player in perfecting the established order.""Observers have noted that the international situation has become increasingly complex at a time when global peace and development are facing serious challenges, including the spillover effect of the lingering Ukraine crisis and US coercion and verbal attacks on China.Zhao Mei, a senior research fellow with the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, said, ""The external environment for China´s economic development is facing dire challenges, and world peace and development are undergoing the most severe tests since the end of the Cold War.""She pointed out that ""the changes in China-US relations are the most prominent part of the changing global landscape not seen in a century. At present, China-US ties are faced with serious challenges, and the international community also has many misunderstandings about China´s development and China´s path for development.""The National Security Strategy Report released by the Biden administration last year claimed that China ""harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit"", Zhao noted.""There´s still a long way to go in telling the Chinese story to the world in an effective manner,"" she said.Path to modernizationIn October, the report to the CPC´s 20th National Congress made it clear that the Chinese path to modernization is one that ""follows the path of peaceful development"".Scholars said this viewpoint is conducive to convincing the international community of China´s consistent dedication to global stability and prosperity.China is the only country in the world that has enshrined its adherence to the path of peaceful development in its constitution, and it is the only one of the ""five nuclear-weapon states"" that has pledged not to be the first to use such weapons.China has never taken the initiative to provoke conflict or war, let alone resort to force or the threat of force, Chinese diplomats said in recent public speeches, adding that the country´s development has always represented a growing force for peace in the world.Jia Qingguo, a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and director of the Institute for Global Cooperation and Understanding at Peking University, said that this method of achieving modernization via the path of peaceful development is ""based on history and reality"" and it contributes Chinese wisdom to the solution of human problems. It rebuts the Clash of Civilizations theory and the stereotypical belief that ""a powerful nation will surely become a hegemony"", Jia said.""More than 70 years after the founding of the People´s Republic of China, the CPC and the Chinese people, who have endured major sufferings, know well the rarity of peace and the value of development, and they take it as their lofty duty to promote world peace and development,"" he said.He added that in the face of the challenge of a growing deficit in global peace, development, security and governance, President Xi proposed the Global Development Initiative in 2021 and the Global Security Initiative last year.These ""provide a Chinese solution for the common development and progress of all countries in the world"", Jia said.Improving world governanceExperts said China´s participation in the reform and strengthening of the global governance system and its commitment to genuine multilateralism — as manifested by the fresh initiatives and road maps for coordinated global efforts — are helping to advance global governance and making it more fair, just and reasonable.""The established global governance model is currently challenged and seems unsustainable, and a new global governance model needs to be explored in a coordinated approach,"" said Liu Xianzhong, a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and director of the Department of Russian History and Culture at the Institute of Russian, East European and Central Asian Studies with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.""Countries should resort to reconciliation and resolve global governance issues in the spirit of building a community with a shared future. Only when the world is a success can China be successful. A better China also contributes to a better world.""Liu said China´s economy is deeply integrated with the global economy, having a high degree of interconnectivity and interdependence in industries with many countries around the world.""China´s unswerving pursuit of a mutually beneficial, win-win opening-up strategy will enable the country to benefit from driving forces worldwide for its development, and the pursuit also allows China´s development to better benefit the world,"" he said.In the field of politics and security, Liu stressed that countries should not engage in cliques and group confrontation, and they should mobilize global resources to address global challenges and promote greater global development.""The success of one country does not necessarily mean the failure of another. Flexing military muscle frequently is a hegemonic approach that can only lift stones and hit one´s own feet,"" he said. ""No country can seek its own absolute security on its own. No country can achieve its own security without the security of the world.""Yang, from the Renmin University of China, noted that the Chinese path to modernization, ""bearing the genes of Chinese civilization, has brought new values and elements to the new international order"".He noted that the socialist system with Chinese characteristics has learned from some of the successful economic management experiences of developed countries, and it has stood out in globalization.""The Chinese experience provides a Chinese solution and Chinese inspiration for developing countries that want to develop while maintaining their independence,"" he said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218462.html,08,3,2023,usa,pdo
How is China's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind viewed? - People's Daily Online,"How is China´s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind viewed? (Xinhua) 09:33, March 09, 2023BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- About 10 years ago, while expounding on China´s views on international affairs at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for forging a community with a shared future for mankind, where each person has a stake in the other.Since then, the concept has evolved into a vision with global significance, and been recognized by more and more countries and international organizations.China will promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, promote greater democracy in international relations, and make global governance more just and equitable, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said Tuesday at a press conference held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People´s Congress.China will offer more, better Chinese insight and solutions to help meet humanity´s common challenges, he added.AN INSPIRING IDEAAs Xi once elaborated, ""to build a community with a shared future for mankind is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and levels of development coming together for shared interests, shared rights and shared responsibilities in global affairs, and creating the greatest synergy for building a better world.""There is a ""very fundamental difference"" between Xi´s vision of a shared future, which emphasizes understanding and shared institution-building, and the prevailing U.S. idea of building a future through competition, Jack Midgley, principal of the global consultancy Midgley &Company, told media.""When Xi says shared future, that´s a future that includes everybody and where everyone´s interests have to be taken into account. We have to find a way to build a shared future together, or there won't be a future at all,"" said Midgley, who is also an adjunct associate professor on security studies at Georgetown University.In September last year, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda published his new book Collected Works of Yasuo Fukuda: Pursuing World Peace, the keyword of which, Fukuda told Xinhua, is a community with a shared future for mankind.Fukuda said he fully agrees with China´s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, arguing that if one country is doing well only by itself when its neighbors are not, the imbalance will lead to conflicts that will then backfire on itself.For B. R. Deepak, chairperson of the Center of Chinese and Southeast Asian Studies at the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University, the vision largely reflects the core values of China´s traditional culture such as harmony and equality.It could be considered as an outcome of China´s dialogue and mutual learning with other civilizations in the course of history, he said.WALK THE TALKChina has not only been advocating a community with a shared future for mankind, but also put it into practice. The burgeoning Belt and Road cooperation shows how China translates its words into deeds, and how the concept helps change the world.Since its operation in December 2021, the China-Laos Railway, a flagship Belt and Road cooperation project, has brought great benefits to the Lao people and opened up a new path for Laos' development and prosperity.""Laos and China joined hands to build the railway, develop and deepen our friendship, and also developed our economy in Laos, especially cargo transportation,"" said Pansay Yiayengva, a conductor at Vientiane Station of the railway.Sharing her working experience, she mentioned that her career has changed her life and made her a mature and responsible person. ""I am very satisfied and proud to work here.""In addition to providing jobs for local residents, the construction and operation of the China-Laos Railway has also increased the fiscal and tax revenue of the Lao government.Meanwhile, thanks to railway transportation, such sectors as mining, agriculture, tourism, logistics, commerce, hotels and real estate in Laos have bloomed.Over the past decade, the Belt and Road has galvanized nearly 1 trillion U.S. dollars of investment, established more than 3,000 cooperation projects, created 420,000 local jobs, and helped lift almost 40 million people out of poverty, said the Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday.Belt and Road projects have demonstrated how effective cooperation can transform the concept of ""building a community with a shared future for mankind"" into practical reality, said Almas Chukin, a prominent Kazakh economist.When it comes to safeguarding global peace, China has also upheld the spirit of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Committed to promoting a new type of international relations, China has been deepening and expanding global partnerships based on equality, openness, and cooperation.China is a major troop contributor and the second-largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, and has set up an 8,000-strong peacekeeping standby force.Last year, China proposed the Global Security Initiative, which advocates a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, follows the philosophy that humanity is an indivisible security community, and aims to create a new path to security that features dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliance and win-win over zero-sum.WAY OUT OF THE MIREWith the world beset with such grave challenges as a sluggish economic recovery, surging isolationism, rising hegemonism and flare-ups of geopolitical conflicts, the international community is eagerly exploring the way forward.""Humanity should overcome difficulties in solidarity and pursue common development in harmony,"" Xi offered China´s solution to the problems at a conference marking the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People´s Republic of China in the United Nations.Bearing in mind that ""no person or country can thrive in isolation,"" China has been championing an open economy and promoting a more balanced, inclusive and sustainable growth, thus enabling the world to share in its development opportunities. It has rolled out such cooperation platforms as the China International Import Expo (CIIE) and put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI).At the fifth edition of the CIIE, tentative deals worth a total of 73.52 billion dollars were reached for one-year purchases of goods and services. Drawing a blueprint for a more inclusive development of the world, the GDI has won international recognition. More than 100 countries and a number of international organizations, including the United Nations, have committed support to the GDI, and close to 70 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI.Meanwhile, China has delivered global public goods where needed. To narrow the ""immunization gap"" exposed in the pandemic, China and other BRICS countries inaugurated a vaccine research and development center to make vaccines accessible and affordable for developing countries.In particular, China actively responds to the calls and concerns of the poverty-stricken countries which bear the brunt in the aftershock of the global pandemic and economic downturn. For example, China is helping many African countries, such as Mozambique, develop modern agriculture with the help of the China-developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and unmanned equipment.Building a sense of a shared future is important for the world to avoid fragmentation and address challenges, former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said.The Belt and Road is an important path toward materializing this vision, Hatoyama said, adding that the initiative will help promote regional economic development and exchanges between countries, thereby preventing disputes effectively.""The global future of the human species ... is an issue which commands the attention of people everywhere in the world. There are so many things that need to be done. So China can take the lead on that,"" Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219225.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Mexican president slams ""hypocrisy"" and ""yellow journalism"" of U.S. media outlets - People's Daily Online","Mexican president slams ""hypocrisy"" and ""yellow journalism"" of U.S. media outlets (Xinhua) 11:05, March 08, 2023MEXICO CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday accused U.S. media outlets of ""hypocrisy"" and ""yellow journalism"" in their coverage of four American kidnap victims in north Mexico, two of whom were found dead.""It is very striking that these unfortunate events happen and all the media in the United States handle the news in a sensationalist manner, not like when they murder Mexicans in the United States, (then) they are as quiet as mummies,"" the president said during his daily press conference.At the press conference, Lopez Obrador received a call from the governor of northern Tamaulipas state, Americo Villarreal, who said the four Americans who disappeared on March 3 were located, though only two had survived.Lopez Obrador noted that U.S. media failed to cover a violent incident a month ago in which the victims were two Mexican day laborers, one of whom was killed and the other injured by American farmers on the outskirts of the city of San Francisco.""They hypocritically clutch their pearls,"" said Lopez Obrador, referring to the way the media cherrypicks which cases to spotlight.The four Americans had reportedly driven across the border into north Mexico for medical tourism when their vehicle with U.S. license plates was fired on and then surrounded by armed men who carted them away in a pickup truck, according to local media citing reports from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218706.html,08,3,2023,usa,pdo
Successful COVID fight sets example - People's Daily Online,"Successful COVID fight sets exampleBy LI LEI (China Daily) 09:45, March 08, 2023A medical worker administers a dose of COVID-19 vaccine to a senior resident in Hufeng village of Wenchang, South China´s Hainan province, Dec 22, 2022. [Photo/Xinhua]Populous nations can learn from China´s experience during pandemicChina, with one-fifth of the global population, triumphantly exited the three-year COVID-19 pandemic with the lowest cost in terms of human life, setting a good example for other populous countries, experts said.Based on the success, Chinese policymakers, in retrospect, are proposing wide-ranging reforms aimed at consolidating the country´s public health system.Legislative suggestions on that front have become trending topics during the annual two sessions — the meetings of the National People´s Congress and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference National Committee.The top legislature and the political advisory body are currently meeting in Beijing.The spread of the disease has ""basically ended"" among the country´s 1.4 billion people, with only smaller, sporadic infections still occurring, Liang Wannian, head of the National Health Commission´s expert panel on the response to COVID-19, said at a closely watched news conference last month.He said China has blazed a trail showing how countries with a sizable population can evade a major pandemic.The comments came after a ""major, decisive victory"" in the fight against the disease was declared on Feb 16 at a key meeting of the Communist Party of China.Presided over by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, the meeting agreed that China has created a miracle in the history of human civilization for a country with a vast population to successfully prevail over a pandemic.Speaking at the news conference held by the State Council´s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism, the country´s COVID-19 task force, NHC spokesman Mi Feng said the Omicron-fueled outbreak — which had led to a spike in locally transmitted cases nationwide from November — has subsided and turned out for the better.He said the past three years have witnessed the constant fine-tuning of China´s COVID strategy, including the downgrading of the management of the disease in January in light of the virus' decreasing virulence.The dynamic adjustment has helped strike a balance between disease control and economic growth, and worked to check the spread of the more lethal lineages of the novel coronavirus earlier.""It effectively protected people´s lives and health,"" Mi said.Official figures showed that since November, China has treated 200 million infected patients, including nearly 800,000 critically ill patients, and that the death rate from COVID-19 has remained at the lowest level in the world.According to the National Health Commission in July, China´s average life expectancy continued to rise amid the pandemic, from 77.93 years in 2020 to 78.2 years in 2021.Meanwhile, average life expectancy in the United States — home to an advanced health system — fell over the same period from 77 years in 2020 to 76.1 years in 2021, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the country´s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The total number of COVID-related deaths in the US had reached 1.1 million by January, according to the CDC.China´s regularly modified COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plans, which offer guidance to front-line medics, were the secret to underpinning China´s success in saving lives, experts said.China has introduced 10 such plans and four plans for treating COVID patients in critical condition over the course of three years.Speaking at a news conference on Feb 27, Guo Yanhong, director of the NHC´s health emergency division, said the evolving plans informed doctors of what parameters to track in patients so that doctors can intervene earlier and prevent them from descending into life-threatening conditions.She said the plans represented increasing understanding of the virus, including its symptoms, virulence and modes of transmission. More recent plans have advocated a number of effective treatments, such as blood plasma taken from patients that have recovered, and newly approved antiviral drugs.""The plans were adjusted according to increasing knowledge of the virus,"" Guo said.China kept its border controls in place until January. By this time, the dominant Omicron subvariants were much less deadly than their predecessors, and more than 90 percent of the Chinese people had been vaccinated.The combined factors have laid foundations for China´s economy, which slowed during pandemic-triggered lockdowns, to rebound faster than many Western observers had expected.The National Bureau of Statistics said on March 1 that a gauge of manufacturing rose at the fastest pace in more than a decade in February, while export orders expanded. Services and construction activity also expanded further.On the back of China´s achievements, the virus also exposed some of the long-running shortcomings in the country´s emerging public health system. They have gained the attention of multiple NPC deputies and members of the CPPCC National Committee this year.Li Yan, a national lawmaker and chief executive officer of Qilu Pharmaceutical, a private drugmaker in Jinan, Shandong province, said that the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province in late 2019 had temporarily fallen into a shortage of medics and overstretched hospitals.To address the problem, authorities mobilized medics and resources in non-affected regions to help out in hard-hit cities, which had effectively worked but should not be the ""lasting solution"", she said in an interview with the Economic Observer newspaper.Li suggested that authorities build a public health service network with multiple community-based outposts, which are tasked with detecting and reporting infectious diseases, in the hope of nipping any potential outbreak in the bud.Zhu Tao, a political adviser behind China´s first single-dose adenovirus vaccine for COVID-19, said vaccines have become the central pillar of China´s COVID control now that many pandemic restrictions have been eliminated.""Vaccines are the cheapest option for society as a whole, and have the minimum impact on the economy compared with other options,"" he told China Youth Daily.Zhu, who works for CanSino Biologics and led the research on the company´s messenger RNA COVID vaccine, which is now under clinical trial, suggested that efforts be made to standardize the emergency use of medications and more so that China can better cope with future public health emergencies.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0308/c90000-10218567.html,08,3,2023,usa,pdo
US sowed 20 years of misery - People's Daily Online,"US sowed 20 years of miseryBy JAN YUMUL in Hong Kong  (China Daily) 09:36, March 20, 2023Renewed calls for justice over invasion of Iraq without UN consentEditor´s note: On March 20, 2003, the United States launched a military invasion of Iraq, the second time it fought a war in that country in a little more than 10 years. Now, two decades after war broke out, China Daily reviews how the US broke a unified state at the heart of the Arab world with falsehoods, opening a power vacuum and leaving oil-rich Iraq a wounded nation in the Middle East.Twenty years after the United States-led invasion of Iraq, the world continues to call for Washington to be held to account for its aggression and the misery it caused to millions of innocent Iraqis.The invasion of Iraq started on March 20, 2003, after Washington accused Baghdad of developing weapons of mass destruction. The claim was later found to be false. Kofi Annan, then United Nations secretary-general, termed the war illegal, saying the action was not in conformity with the UN Charter.Hassan Imran, a legal activist who is a board member at Law for Palestine, a nonprofit that has offices in Sweden and Manchester, England, noted that the US had acted unilaterally outside the collective ambit of the UN Security Council, citing a right to self-defense, but this had been very problematic in the eyes of a majority of international law experts.""Self-defense in international law has certain conditions, mainly that it should be against an imminent and proximate threat to one´s territory, and this was not met in this case,"" Imran said, adding that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.The unprovoked war also raises questions in regard to international governance and US double standards, as well as its self-assumed role as the regulator of international law to help bring alleged perpetrators of crimes to justice, observers and analysts say.According to the Costs of War project, which was founded more than a decade ago at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and was codirected by two scholars of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, it was estimated that the Iraq War could have cost US taxpayers more than $2 trillion.It noted that the ensuing war, in which the US ground presence peaked in 2007 with more than 170,000 soldiers, caused tens of thousands of deaths, destruction and political instability in Iraq. Further, among the consequences was ""the increase in sectarian politics, widespread violence and the rise of the Islamic State militant group with its terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East"".Although the US government officially ended its war in Iraq in 2011, the repercussions of the invasion and occupation, as well as subsequent and continuing military interventions, have had an enormous human, social, economic, and environmental toll, the study said. An estimated 300,000 people have died as a result of the war, while ""the reverberating effects of war continue to kill and sicken hundreds of thousands more"", it said.Deeply polarized""One has to be cognizant of the fact that Iraqi society is deeply polarized,"" said Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan. ""Building on my experiences during a visit last year, there is one stratum of society which is extremely rich and one section which is in the perils of extreme poverty — no in-between.""Iraq ""is only somewhat starting to recover from decades of tumultuous events"", she said, which include the 2003 US invasion, the 2014 anti-Islamic State coalition and regional proxy wars.""It took Iraq more than 30 years to settle the reparations for its invasion (of) Kuwait. The US invasion took place in 2003, so one can't expect (any such reparations to Iraq) to happen in the short to medium term,"" Siddiqa said, adding that Iraq has also failed to present a unified front.Last year, more than 30 years after the United Nations Compensation Commission was created to ensure restitution for Kuwait owing to Iraq´s invasion of 1990, the reparations body announced it had processed its final claim, amounting to $52.4 billion in total.According to the United Nations, 1.5 million successful claims were awarded, out of a total of about 2.7 million lodged with the commission. If all the claims had been found legitimate, it said, that would have meant a total payout of $352.5 billion.""Payment of reparations for an illegal invasion is a key principle of international humanitarian law,"" said Ahmad Ghouri, director of internationalization at the School of Law, Politics and Sociology at the University of Sussex in England.Paying reparations""By requiring new leadership of an invading country to pay reparations for an earlier regime´s actions, international law aims to deter future wars of aggression. Another aim is to provide transitional justice to people affected by illegal invasion.""He also cited the plight of refugees and other non-nationals in Iraq after the fall of the government of Saddam Hussein on April 11, 2003, which has been well documented.""However, no such compensation is demanded by the UN Security Council from the United States of America or the United Kingdom, although it has undoubtedly established that their joint invasion of Iraq in 2003 was illegal,"" Ghouri said.""All parties, including the US and the UK, committed war crimes including massacres and torture on a massive scale. On the face of this illegal invasion, the UN´s inaction to create a commission to compensate Iraq, its people, and foreigners affected by war is a mockery of international law and the law of war.""Iraqi journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi, who gained fame for hurling his shoes at President George W. Bush in a news conference to show his anger at the corruption and chaos that followed the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, said he is still furious.""The same people who entered 20 years ago with the occupier are still ruling despite failures and corruption. The United States knows very well that it brought in pseudo politicians,"" he told Reuters, recounting his actions back in 2008 during a Baghdad media briefing.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224563.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo

What China's green transition means for the world - People's Daily Online,"What China´s green transition means for the world (Xinhua) 08:34, March 14, 2023-- China´s low-carbon strategy was laudable, said Phay Siphan, Cambodian government´s chief spokesman. ""It truly demonstrates China´s commitment to promoting global carbon emissions reduction and green development.""-- As China is transitioning towards a greener development mode, low-carbon industries in the country have been flourishing in recent years, which has spawned more business opportunities for enterprises worldwide.-- Domestically, China´s green transition is bringing a real change. Globally, it is also helping other countries to sustain green growth.BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.This philosophy for green and sustainable development has well depicted one of the defining features of China in the new era. It means that Beijing, when pushing forward China´s development, is committed to maintaining harmony between humanity and nature.Under such a guideline, China´s green transition is rapidly gaining momentum, from developing non-fossil energy to updating the industrial structure, from investing in low-carbon technologies to transforming the transport sector.What has China achieved in its green shift? How is it benefiting both China´s industries as well as others around the world in terms of environmental protection and development opportunities?LOW CARBONChina has established a carbon neutralization working mechanism to implement the ""dual carbon"" goal, which is to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. It has clarified the top-level design of the ""dual carbon"" work, and formulated implementation plans in energy, industry, transportation as well as other key areas.Over the past years, China has taken concrete steps to optimize its energy mix, in which renewable energy has played a more significant role.Data show that the installed capacity of renewable energy has surpassed one billion kilowatts, accounting for 44.8 percent of China´s overall installed capacity. The installed capacity of hydropower, wind power, and photovoltaic power each exceeded 300 million kilowatts, all ranking the highest in the world, according to a white paper titled China´s Green Development in the New Era, released by China´s State Council Information Office in January.From 2012 to 2021, China´s annual energy consumption growth rate of 3 percent supported an average economic growth rate of 6.6 percent, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP decreased by about 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, with a cumulative saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal.Aerial photo taken on Aug. 19, 2020 shows wind turbines in Jiucaiping scenic spot in southwest China´s Guizhou Province. (Xinhua/Liu Xu)In 2021, China´s national carbon market officially launched online trading, covering 4.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, making it the world´s largest carbon market. It has encouraged companies to reduce their carbon emissions by putting a price on carbon, and drive the development of low-carbon technologies.China´s low-carbon strategy was laudable, said Phay Siphan, Cambodian government´s chief spokesman. ""It truly demonstrates China´s commitment to promoting global carbon emissions reduction and green development.""OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONEGreen is the new gold. As China is transitioning towards a greener development mode, low-carbon industries in the country have been flourishing in recent years, which has spawned more business opportunities for enterprises worldwide.The new energy vehicle (NEV) industry is a fine illustration. Last year alone, China sold about 6.89 million NEVs, skyrocketing 93.4 percent year on year. NEV production soared 96.9 percent from a year earlier to about 7.06 million units. The market share of NEVs in China´s auto market reached 25.6 percent in 2022, up 12.1 percentage points from 2021.Thanks to China´s thriving NEV market, Mercedes-Benz increased its deliveries of NEVs by 143 percent year on year in 2022. Hubertus Troska, member of the board of management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG responsible for Greater China, said last month that the German carmaker will continue to invest more in China.""We will expand our layout of R&D and industry chain and accelerate our innovative transformation towards electrification, digitalization, and carbon neutrality to meet the upgrading luxury mobility needs of Chinese customers,"" Troska said in an interview with Xinhua.Citing China´s ever-growing portion of the global electric vehicle market, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, said China can play a crucial role in stimulating the low-carbon growth strategy of the world economy.Aerial photo taken on Oct. 12, 2022 shows new energy vehicles (NEVs) at a factory of Chinese automaker Chery Holding Group Co., Ltd. in Wuhu City, east China´s Anhui Province.

Economic growth: Quantity vs quality - People's Daily Online,"Economic growth: Quantity vs qualityBy Michael Zakkour (China.org.cn) 10:43, March 15, 2023Robots work at a semiconductor company in Gaoyou, Jiangsu province, on Feb. 24. [Photo/Xinhua]The quantity/quality debate is something we, as businesses, product creators and economic stewards, often face. Do we focus on high-quality/low-unit development or sacrifice some quality for the scalability of mass output? Both have their benefits and challenges. But sometimes a situation calls for quality and quantity in equal measure and striking a balance isn't always easy.At the First Session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC), the highest state organ of power in China, from March 5 to 13, steadying and growing the economy was perhaps the most important topic of discussion and deliberation.In short, the message from the country´s leadership was that China is planning a course for a GDP growth of approximately 5 percent in 2023. But this must be ""quality"" growth as well. ""While the annual GDP target is an appropriate growth pace required to stabilize expectations and economic expansion, the Chinese economy intends to continue its focus on high-quality development,"" Liu Shouying, Dean of the School of Economics at Renmin University of China, said, according to Xinhua News Agency.This approach recognizing the need for a delicate balance of quantity versus quality is a positive sign.So, where to begin? We can start by using our senses. A walk or drive around Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan or Chengdu will stir the senses. You can see people out and about at almost pre-pandemic levels.On the streets of these cities, you can once again hear traffic, the buzz of people talking to each other and shouting into their mobile phones. You can smell the street foods, congee and dumplings of vendors and shops cooking, and you can once again touch and feel products in physical retail environments.Bringing the five senses back to life is the necessary foundation for growth. This gives me a great deal of optimism that, over the next year, the Chinese economic engine will once again be shifting into high gear.Now, we move on to the questions of quantity and quality.Quantity There are several economic key sectors that require rapid growth in quantity.The first is employment. The three-year COVID-19 era disrupted the normal patterns, and reliable growth, of employment, a key driver in China´s economic growth over the last 25 years. Healthy engagement drives healthy spending on necessities, housing, luxuries, etc.Over the last three years, as factory activity either slowed or came to a complete halt, many workers returned to their hometowns—and many stayed there.The reduced foot traffic in or closing of small retail shops, department stores, restaurants and malls also left many frontline workers underemployed or unemployed. The construction and infrastructure sectors witnessed a similar effect. Many tech workers found themselves made redundant in the downturn and China is now producing a record number of college graduates who have entered a challenging private sector employment landscape.Increasing the quantity of job opportunities available across all sectors of the economy is at the top of the agenda. This is the key to the spending and consumption that will charge the economy back to life and create a virtuous cycle of employment/spending/employment.This year, China will ""create around 12 million new urban jobs, with a surveyed urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 percent,"" according to the government work report submitted to the NPC for deliberation on March 5. Other annual objectives include ""keeping the consumer price index increase at around 3 percent and grain output above 650 million tons.""Another key area where quantity in growth will be positive is in providing manufacturers and global buyers with incentives to spur the goods export sector. As much as consumption and the digital economy have helped balance the Chinese economy, manufacturing and exports are still critical to growth and employment.Whatever can be done to get the greatest number of small, medium-sized and mega manufacturers back up to higher or full capacity will generate growth in the coming 12-24 months.Quality The digital economy matters to China´s near and long-term economic development. It is worth reiterating that here in the context of quality growth.Said economy is a base for high-paying white-collar jobs across different industries as well as drives innovation.It is innovation in sectors such as electric vehicles, data science, high-value/hi-tech manufacturing, clean energy, semiconductors and cutting-edge biopharmaceuticals that provides quality growth.At the NPC session, officials underscored efforts to pursue high-quality development through policy priorities such as accelerating ""the modernization of the industrial system and promoting the transition to a green development pattern.""China aims to reduce its energy consumption per unit of GDP by around 2 percent this year and ""will strive for better results in actual work.""The NPC session also outlined objectives of continued reductions in the country´s discharge of major pollutants, stronger control over the consumption of fossil fuels and steady improvements in the natural environment.On boosting the country´s technology strength, the government work report urged for ""pooling quality resources and making concerted efforts to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields."" It also underlined efforts to make traditional industries and small and medium-sized enterprises more advanced, smarter and eco-friendlier.""We have taken decisive measures to step up macro policy support while refraining from adopting a deluge of strong stimulus policies that would eat into our potential for future growth,"" the report further read.High-quality development is deemed ""the first and foremost"" task in China´s modernization endeavor. Instead of taking GDP growth as the sole criterion for success, China now focuses more on improving the quality and efficiency of its growth.As part of the better quality of development, China has seen increased spending on research and development over the past five years, with reduced energy intensity and carbon emissions, according to the report.By pursuing the following strategies, China could balance the speed and quality of its economic growth:China has made some strides in addressing air pollution and curbing carbon emissions, but more needs to be done: The government could continue to invest in renewable energy and implement policies that encourage companies to reduce their environmental impact;China has made significant progress in areas such as artificial intelligence and 5G technology. By investing in research and development, China can continue to drive economic growth while also improving productivity and competitiveness;While economic growth has lifted many people out of poverty, it has also widened the rich-poor gap. Quality growth will benefit all levels of Chinese society;While China has been dominated by large state-owned enterprises, the government could take steps to encourage entrepreneurship and small business growth, which could in turn promote innovation and competition.These tactics would also ensure that the country´s economic development is sustainable and benefits all segments of society.The author is founder and CEO of U.S.-based consulting firms 5 New Digital and China BrightStar.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222588.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo

It was a preposterous show in violation of the spirit of democracy and exposed the U.S. hegemony in the guise of democracy, which has been criticized and opposed by many countries.According to a Pew Research Center survey, only about one fifth of Americans say they trust their government, one of the lowest in history. Sixty-five percent say most political candidates run for office to serve their own personal interests. According to a report released by Germany-based Dalia Research and the Alliance of Democracies, less than 50 percent of Americans surveyed think their country is democratic and 43 percent of respondents globally think democracy in their countries is threatened by the U.S., said Wang.""If the U.S. democracy fails to win the trust of its own people, how can the U.S. think it has the right to lecture other countries on democracy,"" the spokesperson said.Wang noted that instead of reflecting upon and making up for its growing democracy deficit, the U.S. has redoubled its effort to tout the U.S. democracy and interfered in other countries' internal affairs and even instigated wars in the name of promoting democracy.The U.S. has practiced a ""Neo-Monroe Doctrine"" in Latin America, instigated ""color revolutions"" in Eurasia, and orchestrated the ""Arab Spring"" in West Asia and North Africa, constantly bringing chaos, livelihood woes and human rights disasters to many countries, Wang said, adding that this is just one of the many textbook examples of how the U.S. democracy destabilizes the world. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10223046.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo

""Politicians from both parties promise action, but we're still waiting.""""When the national media loses interest and the celebrities finally go home, our community will still be left dealing with this disaster,"" Cozza warned.""My story is just like so many others,"" she added. ""The only path forward for us is to come together and demand action from both Norfolk Southern and federal and state officials.""The incident involved 11 tank cars carrying hazardous materials that subsequently ignited, fueling fires that damaged an additional 12 non-derailed railcars.First responders implemented an evacuation zone surrounding the derailment site that affected up to 2,000 residents. There were no reported fatalities or injuries, according to a report issued by the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB).Responders mitigated the fire on Feb. 5, the NTSB report said. But five derailed ""specification tank cars carrying 115,580 gallons of vinyl chloride"" continued to concern authorities because the temperature inside one tank car was still rising.The NTSB said responders later scheduled a ""controlled venting"" of the five vinyl chloride tank cars to release and burn the vinyl chloride and dug ditches to contain released vinyl chloride liquid while it vaporized and burned.The controlled venting began on Feb. 6, which discharged toxic and potentially deadly fumes into the air.While residents were allowed to return to their homes in East Palestine two days later, they remain concerned about the handling of the incident as well as the health impact of exposure to those chemicals.Headache, anxiety, coughing, fatigue and irritation, pain, and burning of the skin continue to be the most common symptoms reported by residents in the East Palestine area, according to a health assessment survey.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw testifies at a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on protecting public health and the environment in the wake of the Norfolk Southern train derailment and chemical release in East Palestine, Ohio in Washington, D.C., the United States, March 9, 2023.

Moreover, the terrorist attack was clearly committed at the state level because no amateurs can carry out such actions,"" Putin said.""An explosion of this kind, of such power, at such a depth can only be carried out by specialists and supported by all the might of a country with certain technologies,"" he explained.Russia requested the Danish authorities check the Nord Stream pipelines as explosive devices could still be planted there, but ""the answer was vague ...

Researchers discover possible turtle swim track from late Triassic - People's Daily Online,"Researchers discover possible turtle swim track from late Triassic (Xinhua) 10:59, March 15, 2023BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have discovered a possible turtle swim track from the Third Member of the Late Triassic Xujiahe Formation in Pengzhou City of southwest China´s Sichuan Province.According to the research team, led by Xing Lida from the China University of Geosciences in Beijing, this trace fossil is about 7 cm in length and 6 cm in width, with an obvious three-toed pattern and long claw marks that sharpen to the distal end. They conducted a three-dimensional scan and compared it with the footprints of other reptiles.Based on the results, it can be inferred that the morphology of the imprints bears the closest resemblance to turtle tracks, and it is highly probable that an early non-crown group representative was the creator of these imprints, according to the researchers.They added that because of the limited specimen, they do not completely exclude an affinity with crocodylomorphs, theropod dinosaurs, or other archosaurs.The discovery of these imprints adds to the Late Triassic fauna in Pengzhou and suggests that there may be more vertebrate fossil records to uncover. This finding is also valuable for scientists studying the local paleoenvironment.The researchers published their findings jointly with their counterparts from Australia and the United States in the journal Historical Biology.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222604.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo

Türkiye's Erdogan says he will support Finland's NATO bid - People's Daily Online,"Türkiye´s Erdogan says he will support Finland´s NATO bid (Xinhua) 13:47, March 18, 2023ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed Friday to ask the parliament to vote on Finland´s NATO membership bid, but delayed that of Sweden, saying Finland has taken concrete steps to address Türkiye´s security concerns.""We have observed concrete and sincere steps from Finland in recent times. As a result of Finland´s sensitivities towards our legitimate security concerns, we have decided to initiate the approval process"" in the parliament, Erdogan said at a press conference with Finland´s President Sauli Niinisto in the Turkish capital of Ankara.With Erdogan´s backing, Finland´s NATO bid will be forwarded to the Turkish parliament, where the Turkish President´s party and ally hold the majority. The parliament will go into recess before mid-April, in the run-up to the country´s presidential and parliament elections set for May 14.The Turkish president said he hoped Finland´s NATO bid could be finalized before the elections.He stressed he believed that NATO will further strengthen and play a crucial role in global security with Finland´s admission.Erdogan meanwhile said Türkiye still expected Sweden to extradite 120 members of what Turkey calls terrorist groups, before his country approaches the Swedish membership bid ""positively.""Finnish President Niinisto, for his part, welcomed Türkiye´s decision as ""a significant move for all the people of Finland,"" but hinted that Finland would only join the military bloc together with Sweden.""Because we have joint security interests. We have borders in the Baltic Sea. I hope we will be an alliance with 32 members at the Vilnius Summit,"" he said, speaking of the planned NATO summit in July.Finland and Sweden applied to join NATO in May 2022 in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Their accession to NATO needs the approval of all member states of the military alliance. Türkiye and Hungary are the only NATO member states that are holding back their approvals.Türkiye accused the two Nordic countries of supporting anti-Turkish Kurdish organizations and political dissidents. Türkiye also asked the two countries to extradite suspects affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulen Movement.In June 2022, Türkiye lifted its objections after reaching a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sweden and Finland ahead of the NATO summit in Madrid.In the MoU, Finland and Sweden pledged to support Türkiye´s fight against terrorism, and agreed to address Türkiye´s ""pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously and thoroughly.""The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the United States and the European Union, has been rebelling against the Turkish government for more than three decades.The Gulen Movement is led by and named after the U.S.-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen who is regarded by his followers as a spiritual leader. The Turkish government accuses the movement of masterminding the failed coup in 2016 that killed at least 250 people.Lifting defense industry restrictions on Türkiye was another condition of the deal. Sweden and Finland have restricted arms exports to Türkiye after the country started a cross-border operation in northern Syria in 2019. On Sept. 30 last year, Sweden´s Inspectorate of Strategic Products, which controls arms exports, said it had authorized military exports to Türkiye.Several protests in the Swedish capital of Stockholm in January, including a demonstration that a far-right politician burned the Quran, also infuriated Ankara.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0318/c90000-10224301.html,18,3,2023,usa,pdo
Domestic banks ready to counter global turmoil - People's Daily Online,"Domestic banks ready to counter global turmoilBy  SHI JING in Shanghai and HENG WEILI in New York (Chinadaily.com.cn) 09:03, March 17, 2023Bank: Similar cases unlikely to happen in ChinaWith troubled Swiss bank Credit Suisse casting a shadow over the global banking system, China´s system is better placed to avoid any turmoil given its relative independence and a stable interest rate environment, experts said on Thursday.Credit Suisse´s one-year credit default swaps — the derivative showing the cost of insuring its bonds against default — surged to 1,000 basis points on Wednesday, similar to levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis and an indication that the bank is in deep financial distress.The bank´s shares opened at 2.28 Swiss francs ($2.46) per share on Wednesday morning, before falling to 1.55 francs, and closing at an all-time low of 1.70. However, its share price soared more than 30 percent on Thursday morning, after the bank announced it will borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank, the country´s central bank.Credit Suisse´s problems followed the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States, which was caused by asset-liability mismatch risks. On Wednesday, European banks also saw their prices slashed by 6 percent on average, while big US banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup each fell about 5 percent.Cases similar to Credit Suisse and SVB are unlikely to happen in China thanks to the country´s orderly and stable interest rate environment, reasonably ample liquidity and banks' prudential management, said Xiao Feifei, chief banking industry analyst at CITIC Securities.The People´s Bank of China, the Chinese central bank, said in a statement released on Wednesday that efforts will be made to further consolidate the mechanism to deal with financial crisis, strengthen supervision, and warn about and evaluate financial risks. In this way, financial risks can be discovered, rectified and addressed at an early stage. The PBOC recently held a financial stability work conference.Unlike the US or Europe, where interest rates have risen sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic, China´s interest rates has remained largely stable. The interbank short-term interest rates and mid- to long-term government bond interest rates have stayed at relatively low levels compared to historical data, said Ni Jun, chief banking industry analyst at GF Securities.The huge loss confronting US and European banks related with government bond investment does not exist among Chinese banks. Most Chinese banks' assets have been invested in the real economy over the past two years, including manufacturing and strategic emerging industries, he said.Switzerland´s second-largest bank, Credit Suisse has faced serious problems in recent years. Its assets totaled $574 billion at the end of last year, down 30.7 percent from 2021 and 37 percent in 2020.Credit Suisse is far larger than SVB and considered important to the global financial system.""Credit Suisse has been a (slow)-moving car crash for years it seems, but now today´s news of course is happening in the vortex of SVB,"" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial, reported CNBC.Zhou Lanxu in Beijing contributed to this story.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0317/c90000-10223683.html,17,3,2023,usa,pdo

"Profile: With popular mandate, Xi Jinping spearheads new drive to modernize China - People's Daily Online","Profile: With popular mandate, Xi Jinping spearheads new drive to modernize China (Xinhua) 08:07, March 15, 2023Xi Jinping, newly elected president of the People´s Republic of China (PRC) and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the PRC, makes a public pledge of allegiance to the Constitution at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 10, 2023. Xi was unanimously elected president of the People´s Republic of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission of the PRC at the third plenary meeting of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC) on March 10, 2023. (Xinhua/Xie Huanchi)BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- About five months after his election as general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Xi Jinping won his third term as Chinese president at the annual session of the national legislature, which concluded on Monday.At the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC), Xi was also elected chairman of the country´s Central Military Commission. Assuming the top posts in the Party, the state, and the armed forces, Xi is leading the country with 1.4 billion people on a new journey to modernization.Wrapping up the session, Xi delivered a closely-watched speech to a gathering of nearly 3,000 lawmakers. ""The people´s trust is my biggest motivation moving forward and is also a weighty responsibility on my shoulders,"" Xi said.Xi announced that the central task of the entire Party and all Chinese people, from this day forward to the middle of the century, is to build China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advance national rejuvenation on all fronts.""The relay baton has been passed on to our generation,"" he said.A decade ago, when Xi was first elected Chinese president, he expounded on the ""Chinese Dream,"" saying the dream is about making the country prosperous and strong, rejuvenating the nation and delivering a happy life to its people.Modernizing China has been a persistent pursuit of the Chinese since the Opium Wars. Over the course of a century, generations of the Chinese, led by the CPC, have charted a distinctively Chinese path toward that goal.Born in 1953, Xi started his political career as the Party chief in a small village in northwest China. From there, over the past half century, Xi worked his way up through almost every level of the Party´s hierarchy. He has amassed extensive experience and made noteworthy accomplishments throughout his career.Xi Jinping visits the family of Tang Rongbin in Luotuowan Village of Longquanguan Township, Fuping County, north China´s Hebei Province, Dec. 30, 2012.(Xinhua/Lan Hongguang)Xi was first elected to the Party´s top post in late 2012. For the first time, the position was held by a person born after the founding of the People´s Republic of China in 1949.Since then, he has taken the nation on an ambitious path of revival, according to international media reports. Xi has a clear vision for China, to see it as a powerful country in the world, the reports said.THE COREIn 1969, Xi left Beijing for a small village on the Loess Plateau to live as a farmer, sharing the same fate as millions of youths who came of age during the Cultural Revolution.For someone like Xi who grew up in Beijing, life in the countryside was extremely difficult at the beginning. Villagers often went without meat for several months. Despite the hardships, Xi looked back on this experience as the time when he truly understood the struggles of the common people and society.This unique experience fueled Xi´s determination to always do something for the betterment of the people.While many of his college peers opted to go abroad, Xi applied to work in a poor county called Zhengding in Hebei Province in the early 1980s.In 2012, soon after taking office as the general secretary, Xi visited poor rural families in Hebei. In Gu Chenghu´s home, Xi sat on a heated brick bed and chatted with him.""I have come here to check your living conditions and see what the Party´s leadership can do more for you and people like you,"" Xi said.He held up Gu´s sleeve and showed it to the officials around him, saying, ""Look, his coat is worn out.""At the time, there were around 100 million rural Chinese living under the poverty line of earning an annual income of 2,300 yuan (about 366 U.S. dollars).In less than a year, Xi put forward the ""targeted poverty alleviation"" strategy, and over the span of about eight years sent 255,000 work teams and 3 million cadres to villages, providing one-on-one assistance to impoverished farmers.Xi himself conducted over 50 inspections and research studies on poverty alleviation, which included visits to all 14 regions with high concentrations of extreme poverty.On Feb. 25, 2021, Xi announced that absolute poverty had been eliminated in China.China´s poverty reduction rate has been notably faster than the global average, making it the country with the largest number of people lifted out of poverty worldwide.""If not for Xi´s personal push, poverty reduction would have been even more difficult and taken longer,"" said Zeng Shoufu, who once worked as a village poverty alleviation cadre in Fujian Province.Another challenge was corruption. Upon taking the Party´s top office in late 2012, Xi cautioned that ""if corruption is allowed to spread, it will eventually lead to the collapse of the Party and the fall of the state.""Less than a month into the job, he fired the first shot in his war against corruption. Over the course of ten years, high-ranking ""tigers,"" including a former member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, were taken down.Over 500 centrally-administered officials, most of whom were at or above the ministerial level, were investigated. Crooked officials who fled overseas were brought back through anti-corruption operations initiated by Xi.In 2018, he announced that an ""overwhelming victory"" against corruption had been achieved. But the campaign did not end there. After the 20th CPC National Congress, another nearly 20 senior officials were investigated or punished for corruption.Early this year, at the plenary session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the top graft-busting agency, Xi urged a crackdown on corruption that involves both political and economic issues. He emphasized the need to prevent leading cadres from becoming spokespersons or agents of interest groups and power cliques.The success of poverty alleviation and anti-corruption has won Xi popular support, but this is not the only reason he was unanimously elected into the top office of the Party and the state. In the past decade, many long-standing problems in the country were solved under his leadership.China has steadily developed and become stronger overall, with an average annual economic growth of 6.2 percent over the past decade. It was more than twice the global average. Per capita GDP has doubled to over 12,000 U.S. dollars.China´s share of the world economy has increased from 11.3 percent in 2012 to 18.5 percent at present. The output of grain has consistently been abundant.In the past, China´s manufacturing industry was often referred to as ""big but not strong."" It took a billion pairs of socks to buy a Boeing plane, some said. Today, China has developed its own large passenger aircraft, and technological advancement contributes over 60 percent to the country´s economic growth.China´s digital economy is the second-largest in the world, and its new energy vehicle production and sales have ranked first for eight consecutive years.Shan Zenghai, a technician at the construction machinery manufacturer XCMG, recalled how in 2017, Xi toured the company´s workshop and mounted an all-terrain crane.""He gave us great encouragement, saying that the real economy should never be sidelined,"" Shan said. ""He also said the Chinese economy must transition from high-speed growth to high-quality development.""Xi Jinping takes part in a deliberation with his fellow deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu Province at the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, capital of China, March 5, 2023. (Xinhua/Huang Jingwen)During a deliberation meeting at this year´s NPC session, Shan sat down with Xi again and informed him that all the components of the crane that Xi once mounted are now manufactured in China.""Are the chips in your company´s cranes domestically made?"" Xi asked.""Yes. All are made in China,"" Shan replied.In the past ten years, while eliminating absolute poverty, China has built the world´s largest education, social security, and medical and health care systems. China is adopting measures to provide more accessible and continuous medical and healthcare services to farmers. The life expectancy of the average Chinese increased to 78.2 years in 2021, nearly 2 years higher than that of the average American in that year.Without Xi, China´s ecological environment protection would not have attained historic improvements, observers said. The average concentration of small particles, PM2.5, in the air has decreased for nine consecutive years in major cities, with a cumulative reduction of 57 percent. The once-common occurrence of smog enveloping the skies of northern China has now become rare.Xi pushed for green development as he tackled pollution across the board. He announced that China aims to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. He also pushed for the ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change.Also thanks to his efforts, China was among the first to sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership -- the world´s largest free trade agreement -- and has expanded its free trade pilot zones from one to 21. The entire island of Hainan was turned into a free trade port.Xi is a strong advocate of the spirit of self-reliance and self-improvement. He emphasized the need to enhance the confidence and pride of being Chinese, and the importance of promoting China´s excellent traditional culture, stating that blindly following others is not the way forward.""Are not Hollywood´s films like 'Kung Fu Panda' and 'Mulan' based on our cultural resources?"" he said.Xi´s reform measures have achieved ""historical changes, systematic reshaping, and overall reconstruction"" in many fields, ranging from the economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological protection systems, to national defense and the Party´s own institutions.He made the decision to enshrine the statement of ""allowing the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation and letting the government play a better role"" into the Party´s documents, and led the establishment of the National Commission of Supervision, a powerful anti-corruption agency to oversee every single person in public office.In late 2012, Xi initiated the eight-point decision on improving conduct. This is regarded as a lasting institutional solution to malaise such as squandering, indulging in pleasure, and extravagance. Through this move, Xi succeeded in curbing practices previously deemed uncontrollable.In other aspects of institutional development, Xi oversaw the reform of the talent system to enable researchers at the forefront of science to benefit from their intellectual property rights.A milestone CPC resolution adopted in 2021 states that the Party has affirmed Xi´s core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and affirmed the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.This, according to the resolution, reflects the common will of the Party, the armed forces, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and is of decisive significance for advancing the cause of the Party and the country in the new era and for driving forward the historical process of national rejuvenation.Xi considers the affirmation of his core status to be a weighty responsibility. In his words: ""To honor the trust of the Party and the people, I will dedicate myself to the utmost and be willing to endure any hardship without hesitation.""Party theorists say Xi´s sustained leadership in the Party and state apparatus provides direction, stability, and continuity for China´s development. They said this is conducive to strengthening the Party´s overall leadership and is an important manifestation of the political and institutional advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics.Lu Man, who is an NPC deputy and head of an agricultural cooperative in Jiangsu Province, said the unanimous vote electing Xi as the Chinese president is a major outcome of this year´s ""two sessions."" Lu added that the result is what people have been hoping for and is required to advance the Party and the state´s causes.Xi Jinping leads members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee to visit an exhibition, which features the history of the 13 years of the CPC Central Committee in Yan'an, at the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall in northwest China´s Shaanxi Province, Oct. 27, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Ye)From the 20th CPC National Congress to this year´s ""two sessions,"" a new cohort of officials have assumed positions of governance, including members and alternate members of the Party Central Committee, ministers and provincial-level Party chiefs. Xi urged them to strive diligently and avoid letting down the expectations of the people.According to Party insiders familiar with the matter, these new leading officials ""share some common traits,"" including their strong abilities in terms of political judgment, comprehension, and execution.In the meantime, the military has also completed its leadership transition, with a new Central Military Commission team and a new defense minister.In early November, Xi visited the military´s joint operations command center and called for ""comprehensively strengthening military training and preparedness."" He emphasized multiple times ""the absolute leadership of the Party over the people´s military.""According to Xi, the Party´s leadership defines the fundamental nature of Chinese modernization.Given the immense size of the Party and the country, it is impossible to achieve anything without the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralized and unified leadership, as well as the conformity of the nation, Xi said.""General Secretary Xi has the charisma to unify the whole Party. He is our backbone as the nation charges ahead on the new journey toward modernization,"" said Cai Hongxing, president of Yanbian University, who is also an NPC deputy.A NEW STARTThe NPC is considered a major platform to turn the Party´s propositions into the will of the nation. This means that grand strategies for Chinese modernization, laid out at the 20th Party congress, are being translated into concrete plans at the ""two sessions.""In 1979, late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping introduced the term ""Chinese modernization"" at the beginning of the reform and opening-up as a reference to Xiaokang, or a well-off society. After achieving this goal, the CPC proposed the goal of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.Based on media reports, Xi first used the term ""Chinese modernization"" in a public speech in December 2015 while leading efforts to formulate a development blueprint aimed at propelling the nation toward a moderately prosperous society in all respects.Six years later, during the centennial celebration of the CPC, Xi declared that this objective had been achieved.Xi has continued to refine the strategic deployment of Chinese modernization, moving from building a moderately prosperous society in all respects to embarking on a new modernization journey.At the 19th CPC National Congress, he established a ""timetable"" for achieving modernization, and at the 20th Party congress, five years later, he presented a ""roadmap"" to realize this goal.Xi summarized five major features of Chinese modernization: a huge population, common prosperity for all, coordination of material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development. This sketch of Chinese modernization is now even more precise, well-conceived, and feasible.""He has given a lot of thought to modernization and put it into action. Throughout his career, he has worked from inland to coastal regions and from local to central levels. No matter where he worked, Xi was an active reformer and broke new ground in advancing modernization,"" said David Ferguson, who edited four volumes of the English version of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China.""The objectives for 2023 are to do solid groundwork for building a modern socialist country. The five years starting from 2023 is deemed a crucial phase.The national legislature has approved the government´s growth target of around 5 percent for 2023, which is two percentage points higher than the actual growth last year. This means China´s economic growth in a single year is equivalent to the GDP of a mid-sized developed European country.But China has 1.4 billion people, lowering the country´s development ranking in terms of per capita figures. Explaining the 5-percent growth target, Xi said if China will lift per capita GDP to that of a mid-level developed country by 2035, it is imperative to maintain reasonable growth on the basis of improving quality and efficiency. And China has the capacity to do so.""High-quality development is the primary task of building a modern socialist country,"" he said.Almost all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities on the Chinese mainland had set higher growth targets. Shanghai has set its target at 5.5 percent, while Xinjiang and Tibet have set their targets at around 7 percent and over 8 percent, respectively.Wang Xiangming, a researcher at the Renmin University of China, said a notable change in Chinese society after the 20th Party congress is that people have a stronger sense of developing the economy. ""Without a solid material foundation, it is impossible to achieve socialist modernization.""A major change is a shift in COVID-19 response. Over the past three years, China´s rigorous response measures have effectively protected the lives and health of the people. Last November, Xi presided over a Party leadership meeting to adjust COVID-19 response measures. Three months later, it was declared that China had emerged victorious from the pandemic.Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, said China´s optimization of its COVID-19 policy will likely be the single most important factor for global growth in 2023.Xi Jinping chats with a villager in an orchard in Nangou Village of Yan'an, northwest China´s Shaanxi Province, Oct. 26, 2022. (Xinhua/Yan Yan)Xi made his first out-of-town trip after the 20th Party congress to the countryside. He visited a fruit orchard in Nangou, Shaanxi Province and candidly asked fruit farmers how much they could earn in a day, what their incomes were like, and how their families were doing.""What are the techniques for picking apples?"" he asked, and picked a big red apple himself as farmer Zhao Yongdong demonstrated.Outside an apple sorting workshop in the village, people gathered around Xi. ""His top concern is the livelihoods of the people,"" said Zhang Guanghong, a village cadre.This combo photo shows Xi Jinping extending festive greetings to all Chinese people when he speaks with cadres and people from across the country via video calls ahead of the Spring Festival in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 18, 2023. (Xinhua/Xie Huanchi, Li Tao)Before the Spring Festival, Xi spoke with cadres and people from across the country via video calls. He asked a cadre from a Qiang ethnic minority village in Sichuan Province about the number of tourists and their income. After Xi learned that the per capita income of the whole village exceeded 40,000 yuan last year, he exclaimed ""Not bad!""Wei Zhuo, a tourist, told Xi about her experience in the village. In particular, she said, the local Sichuan-style cured pork was delicious. ""The general secretary asked me to eat more,"" Wei said. ""I feel that he cares a lot about rural development and boosting the income of the common people.""Xi told the accompanying cadres that ""the most arduous and demanding task of building a modern socialist country still lies in the countryside."" At the Central Rural Work Conference in late 2022, he said to strengthen the country, agriculture must be strong first, emphasizing that ensuring a stable and safe supply of grain and important agricultural products is always the top priority.Seeking truth from facts is a tenet much cherished by Chinese Communists. Xi himself has set a good example. Over the past decade, he has made over 100 inspection trips to the grassroots level to obtain first-hand experience on the ground.One time, he left Beijing early in the morning and arrived in a mountainous region in southwest China´s Chongqing in the evening. Sitting in the courtyard with the locals, he said, ""I took a plane, a train, and a car, switching between three modes of transportation just to get here to meet you and hear what you have to say to us.""Another time, at a group discussion of the ""two sessions,"" Xi said, ""You officials cannot fool me. I come from a poverty-stricken area, and I know what it´s like.""The ""new development philosophy,"" introduced by Xi in 2015, prioritizes innovation, coordination, green development, openness, and sharing. It is expected to guide China´s modernization drive.Sci-tech innovation is a priority. Xi has urged the acceleration of the pace of self-reliance and self-strengthening in this regard.Zhang Jin, an NPC deputy and president of robotic company Xinsong, recalled Xi´s visit to the company a few months ago.""In the workshop, he almost stopped at every step and asked questions all the way, showing a strong interest, especially in the company´s self-developed products such as mobile robots used in automobile assembly production lines and robotic arms in the chip-manufacturing industry,"" Zhang said.During a conversation with young engineers, Xi stressed that independent innovation is crucial for a country´s transition to a manufacturing powerhouse. He raised the question of whether there are still lots of technical challenges that need to be addressed urgently, and stated that it is imperative to promote scientific and technological self-strengthening to resolve ""bottleneck issues,"" some of which are caused by Western technological blockade.Xi repeatedly emphasized that reform must adhere to the direction of the socialist market economy. In January, he sent a vice premier to the Davos World Economic Forum annual meeting where the official announced that China will never go back to pursuing a planned economy.In February, a major reform involving the entire capital market was introduced, promoting a registration-based system for the entire market and various public issuance of stocks, which is beneficial for better allocation of resources according to market mechanisms.At the same time, Xi deployed measures to prevent systemic risks in finance, real estate, and local government debt.He emphasized on different occasions that, on one hand, China must deepen the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises, and on the other hand, it should continue to improve the business environment for the private sector.At this year´s ""two sessions,"" Xi told private entrepreneurs that the Party ""has always regarded private enterprises and private entrepreneurs as its own people"" and encouraged them to let go of their concerns and burdens, and boldly pursue their development.""I have always supported private enterprises,"" said Xi, who has worked for more than 20 years in the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, both known for the vibrant private sector.Chinese private enterprises have continued to grow. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in 2012, non-public enterprises accounted for only about 10 percent of the total market value of China´s top 100 listed companies. However, by the end of 2022, this proportion had risen to over 40 percent.Xi said he plans to roll out a new round of overall reform measures this year. High-level opening-up will also be accelerated, including actively promoting the accession to high-standard economic and trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economic Partnership Agreement.In 2021, China´s overall tariff level was reduced to 7.4 percent, lower than the WTO commitment of 9.8 percent. The country plans to further drop tariff rates for 62 information technology products, and the overall tariff level will be lowered by another 0.1 percentage point.Xi Jinping delivers a speech titled ""Working Together for a Bright Future of Openness and Prosperity"" via video at the opening ceremony of the fifth China International Import Expo held in east China´s Shanghai on Nov. 4, 2022.(Xinhua/Gao Jie)There are visible signs that the economic recovery is gaining momentum. In February, China´s manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) reached 52.6 percent, a new high in nearly 11 years. The economy is expected to stabilize and rebound in the first quarter, and foreign investment expectations remain positive.The Canton Fair plans to increase its exhibition booths to nearly 70,000 this year. The China International Import Expo, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the China International Consumer Products Expo, all of which are strongly backed by Xi, are expected to see an expansion in their scales.From building a socialist new countryside to building a beautiful China, from artistic creation to cultural-ethical advancement, Xi has made new arrangements covering all important areas.Xi emphasized that achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the complete reunification of the motherland, which is both necessary and achievable, and he has formulated a general strategy to resolve the Taiwan question.In his speech delivered before the conclusion of this year´s ""two sessions,"" Xi said external interference and separatist activities seeking ""Taiwan independence"" must be resolutely opposed, stressing firmly advancing the national reunification process.""Xi is an idealist and a pragmatic person. He is sober, practical, decisive, has a broad vision and a systemic view,"" said a cadre who had worked with him in Zhejiang Province in the early 2000s. ""He is good at turning crises into opportunities, and can see a blueprint through to the end.""PEOPLE'S LEADERXi is not just for the people but of them.When he labored alongside rural farmers, he learned to grit his teeth while hauling manure and ignored the constant hunger pangs as he worked the land. These formative years taught him the true value of these often overlooked members of society, leaving him with a natural ability to connect and listen to ordinary people to help resolve their problems.He may have left the fields decades ago, but even as general secretary, he has not forgotten those that toil there nor those that man the country´s backbone industries, from workshops to markets. He has remained committed to maintaining a public-facing presence through personal visits or correspondence.Xi Jinping chats and makes dumplings with the family members of retired worker Zhu Maojin as he tours a Beijing hutong, the capital´s distinctive residential lanes, in Qianmen area in central Beijing, capital of China, Feb. 1, 2019. Xi visited primary-level cadres and residents in downtown neighborhoods and inspected the preparation work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Beijing on Feb. 1, 2019.(Xinhua/Ju Peng)During one visit to a Beijing hutong, the capital´s distinctive residential lanes, Xi rolled up his sleeves to make dumplings with one family, and the conversation flowed. Before he left, Xi confided that he draws strength from such interactions.In spite of his busy schedule, Xi has consistently prioritized people´s happiness as essential. On more than one occasion, he said, ""Development should benefit all individuals more equitably and comprehensively, and continually promote the all-round development of people.""At the start of the year, Xi was unanimously voted in as a deputy to the 14th NPC through a competitive election in Jiangsu. He was just one of over 2,900 deputies elected nationwide, representing the country´s dynamic socio-economic diversity, from workers to farmers, technical professionals to migrant workers.On March 5, Xi joined his fellow deputies from the Jiangsu Province delegation at the NPC session to deliberate the government work report and discuss state affairs.The Jiangsu deliberation was not the only meeting Xi attended at this year´s ""two sessions,"" nor was it the only time he has interacted with lawmakers and political advisors.From 2013 to 2022, Xi attended 53 deliberations and discussion sessions, speaking directly to about 400 lawmakers and political advisors. From asking about the marriage rate of an underprivileged central Chinese village to pressing for details of the winter tourism industry in the northeastern province of Jilin, his questions are always poignant and relevant.People familiar with Chinese politics view such interactions as a manifestation of Chinese democracy. Accordingly, it is no surprise that Xi has gained a reputation for supporting public empowerment in their own affairs and encouraging their participation in political affairs.""China is a big country. It is only natural for different people to have different concerns or views on the same issue. What matters is that we reach consensus through communication and consultation,"" Xi said in his New Year Address 2023.In June 2022, China completed the election for the county and township-level people´s congresses. The election involved 1.064 billion voters. It was one of the world´s largest grassroots democratic elections.The people´s congress is the backbone of China´s political system, and NPC deputies are responsible for a wide range of duties, including formulating laws, supervising the government and judicial organs, and electing national leaders.Each of the country´s 55 ethnic minorities is represented in the national legislature. Dong Caiyun is a member of the Bao'an ethnic group, which has a population of only about 20,000.At the ""two sessions"" in 2019, she proposed a new expressway that would boost the development of her county in Gansu Province, northwest China. Other deputies lauded her proposal, and Xi, who was present at the meeting, responded by asking the relevant departments to study the proposal.After rounds of research and feasibility studies, construction began. It is due for completion this year.""This road represents the aspirations of the people in my hometown for a modern life,"" said Dong.Quan Taiqi, who works at a bus station in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, has just completed her second term as a deputy to the national legislature. She voted for Xi to be the Chinese president five years ago.""I endorsed him [as president] because I believe he is a trustworthy leader who truly cares for the people,"" she said.She recalled that Xi was present during a deliberation years ago when she raised an issue about ticket-free child passengers on buses, who might cause over-sale of tickets. Xi immediately spoke up, taking Quan by surprise, as she thought the topic was too specific and menial for a state leader. Xi not only spoke up, but also asked about the practice on trains for reference. After the meeting, a review of the issue quickly began, culminating in a practical plan.""When Xi spoke to us grassroots deputies, he was not condescending. He quizzed us, 'Is it like this?' 'Is this good or not?'"" Quan recalled.During the ""two sessions"" in 2021, Quan met Xi again. She went up to him and brought up their previous interaction. However, the corridor was crowded, but as he left, Xi said, ""Let´s talk about it later."" Quan thought that would be the end of their conversation, but around 11 p.m. that night, she received a call from Xi´s team, asking if she had any suggestions or problems to raise.Xi believes that democracy is a requirement for modern countries, but it must be in line with national conditions, and Chinese democracy should by no means be the same as Western-style democracy. He describes Chinese democracy as a ""whole-process people´s democracy,"" which covers all aspects of the democratic process and all sectors of society.""The purpose of democracy is to address the issues that require resolution by the people,"" he said.Xi Jinping casts his ballot at a polling station to elect deputies to the Xicheng district people´s congress in Huairentang, Zhongnanhai electoral district in Xicheng District of Beijing, capital of China, Nov. 5, 2021. (Xinhua/Ju Peng)Challenges to the system are not tolerated.According to one witness, during a plenary session of the anti-corruption agency in 2014, Xi discussed at length a vote-buying case in the election of local lawmakers in Hunan. Visibly angered, Xi fired a barrage of questions: Where have the Party members gone? Where are their notions of Party discipline and law? Where is their conscience?Afterward, Xi referred to this case on at least two other occasions. Eventually, 467 people were held accountable.The Chinese practice of modernization has often been viewed by observers as difficult, especially given China´s massive scale -- unprecedented since the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Xi has stated that even feeding over 1.4 billion people is a significant challenge. Issues such as employment, distribution, education, healthcare, housing, elderly care, and childcare should not be underestimated, especially given the size of the population.According to Xi, advancing Chinese modernization requires a new journey of law-based governance. The issue of the rule of law versus the rule of man is a fundamental question and major issue that all countries must address in the process of modernization, Xi said.In a signed article commemorating the 40th anniversary of the current Constitution´s promulgation and implementation, Xi emphasized the Constitution´s role in constructing a modern socialist country and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.On Monday, Xi and other NPC deputies voted to amend the Legislation Law, adding content to promote the implementation of the Constitution. In 2018, Xi was the first Chinese president to pledge allegiance to the Constitution. Last week, after being elected, Xi took the oath again, followed by members of his governance team.CHAMPIONING PEACE, DEVELOPMENTIn the second half of last year, Xi returned to ""offline"" diplomatic activities after the ""cloud diplomacy"" that characterized the two and a half years of the pandemic.Over the past four months alone, Xi attended the G20 Summit in Bali, the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok, and the first China-Arab States Summit and the China-Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in Riyadh.On the sidelines of the multilateral events, Xi also held bilateral meetings with leaders from dozens of countries, including France, the Netherlands, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iraq.At home, Xi hosted many foreign leaders and dignitaries in Beijing after the Party congress. The guests included leaders from Vietnam, Pakistan, Tanzania, Germany, Cuba, Mongolia, Laos, Russia, the Philippines, Iran, and Belarus. For some, this marked their first visit to China, while others were ""old friends.""Over the past decade, Xi has clearly conveyed that China will create new opportunities through development and add more stability and certainty to such a volatile world.""As it develops, China will make greater contributions to the common prosperity of the world,"" Xi said.Xi Jinping attends the first China-Arab States Summit at the King Abdul Aziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 9, 2022. Xi delivered a keynote speech titled ""Carrying Forward the Spirit of China-Arab Friendship and Jointly Building a China-Arab Community with a Shared Future in the New Era"" at the summit. (Xinhua/Xie Huanchi)During his meeting with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Riyadh in December, Xi mentioned the FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar, saying that the event injected fresh and positive energy into today´s uncertain world. Tamim thanked China for its contributions to the World Cup, noting that Chinese companies built the main stadium, and the arrival of two pandas added to the festive atmosphere of the tournament.The stadium Tamim mentioned is Qatar´s Lusail Stadium, which hosted the final game of the World Cup between Argentina and France. It is regarded by many as an iconic achievement of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Xi Jinping walks to the venue of the 17th summit of the Group of 20 (G20) in Bali, Indonesia, Nov. 15, 2022. Xi delivered a speech titled ""Working Together to Meet the Challenges of Our Times and Build a Better Future"" at the summit. (Xinhua/Ju Peng)The BRI, proposed by Xi in 2013, also helped Indonesia build its first high-speed railway. After the G20 Summit in Bali, Xi and Indonesian President Joko Widodo watched the operational trial of the Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway through a video link. The railway, jointly built by the two countries, is expected to facilitate the move of goods and people and boost local incomes.To date, 151 countries and 32 international organizations have signed documents under the Belt and Road framework, benefiting participating countries.The Port of Piraeus of Greece has developed into one of the fastest-growing container ports in the world since a Chinese company joined its operation.Another important proposal Xi raised in 2013 was the community with a shared future for humanity. It has been enshrined in both the Party and the country´s constitutions and incorporated into important documents of the United Nations and other international organizations or multilateral mechanisms.Xi told the G20 summit that all countries must embrace the vision of a community with a shared future for humanity and advocate peace, development, and win-win cooperation.""All countries should replace division with unity, confrontation with cooperation, and exclusion with inclusiveness,"" Xi said in the speech.He also solemnly promised the world, ""No matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansionism.""He believes that as long as major countries maintain communication and treat each other sincerely, the ""Thucydides trap"" can be avoided.China has shown the world that a country can develop and progress without engaging in expansionism, and can help other countries develop simultaneously, said Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a signed article published before he visited China in February.In response to Xi´s initiative, Saudi Arabia and Iran delegations held talks earlier this month in Beijing. The two countries have reached an agreement to resume diplomatic relations and reopen embassies and missions within two months.One of Xi´s most high-profile diplomatic meetings in the past months was his first face-to-face meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden since the latter assumed the presidency. During the over-three-hour talk in Bali on Nov. 14, Xi told Biden that China-U.S. relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other, and the successes of China and the United States are opportunities, not challenges, for each other.""China does not seek to change the existing international order or interfere in the internal affairs of the United States and has no intention to challenge or displace the United States,"" Xi said.Biden said the United States respects China´s system and does not seek to change it. The United States does not seek a new Cold War and does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, he said. Biden also said that the United States does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" does not support ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan,"" and has no intention to engage in conflict with China.In his meetings with European leaders, Xi stressed that regarding the Ukraine crisis, China supports ceasefire, cessation of the conflict, and peace talks.In February, China issued a 12-point peace plan on the Ukraine crisis, stating that all countries' sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity must be effectively upheld, and universally recognized international law, including the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, must be strictly observed. ""Nuclear weapons must not be used, and nuclear wars must not be fought,"" said the policy paper.Xi is a leader who provides vision and plans for promoting the solution of major problems facing humanity, said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.PIONEERING HUMAN ADVANCEMENTWhen Xi delivered his 2023 New Year Address, people noticed the tomes on the bookshelf behind him in his office, among them, A General History of China, Complete Poems of the Tang Dynasty, Global History, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. Having called reading his favorite hobby, Xi is known to draw wisdom from the written word to govern the country.Xi Jinping visits the Yinxu Museum in Anyang, central China´s Henan Province, Oct. 28, 2022. (Xinhua/Ju Peng)After the Party congress, Xi headed to Henan Province, central China, and visited the Yinxu Ruins. The 3,300-year-old site was the capital of the late Shang (Yin) Dynasty, the first ruins confirmed from this period. Walking slowly into the Yinxu Museum, Xi thoughtfully took in the exhibits, spanning bronze ware, jade ware, oracle bone inscriptions, and other relics.""I have wanted to visit here for so long,"" Xi said. ""I come here thirsty for a deeper understanding of Chinese civilization so that we can make the past serve the present and draw inspirations for better building modern Chinese civilization.""With a long and continuous history, Chinese civilization shaped our great nation, and this nation will continue to be great, Xi added, urging efforts to promote traditional culture, which according to the leader, is the ""root"" of the Party´s new theories.Xi proposed combining the basic principles of Marxism with traditional culture, believing that only when a country´s modernization is rooted in the fertile soil of its history and culture can it flourish and endure.In 2014, Xi said he was reluctant to see Chinese classic poems and essays removed from the textbooks when visiting Beijing Normal University. In November 2013, he visited Qufu, the birthplace of Confucius, and the following year, he addressed an international commemoration of the ancient Chinese philosopher. In 2021, when he visited a park dedicated to Zhu Xi in east China´s Fujian Province, Xi stopped for a long time in front of the words of the renowned Chinese Confucian philosopher in the 12th century. Zhu famously said that a nation is based on its people, and society is also established for the benefit of its people. Xi, in an earlier group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, had quoted Zhu´s words, stressing that no political consideration is more important than the people.Xi has repeatedly lamented the humiliation and defeat suffered by the Chinese nation, despite its place at the forefront of the world over the past 5,000 years.In particular, he felt that China´s modernization had achieved significant results ""at great cost and with great hardships."" He stressed China, therefore, should blaze its own trail toward modernization. Experts believe that Chinese modernization, which offers a new form of human advancement, dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization."" Xi said efforts must be made to achieve higher efficiency than capitalism while maintaining fairness in society more effectively.According to Zheng Yongnian, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), Chinese modernization is a way to deal with the problems all countries face. Above all, the source of its vitality is mainly sustainable economic development, he said.British scholar Martin Jacques believes that if China can successfully address inequality in the way it has conquered absolute poverty, such fairer and more inclusive modernity will have an enormous global impact.Xi is proud and confident of the achievements and prospects of the modernization drive. He once said, ""China has been able to look the world in the eye,"" referring to the country´s rise in strength. This, however, does not mean the pursuit of unilateral dominance, still less a clash of civilizations. He cited the famous ""sleeping lion"" metaphor for China and noted, ""Today, the lion has woken up.

Chinese envoy blasts U.S. for its handling of Security Council draft resolution on S. Sudan - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy blasts U.S. for its handling of Security Council draft resolution on S. Sudan (Xinhua) 13:40, March 16, 2023UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China´s envoy to the United Nations called the United States irresponsible and ignorant for its handling of a Security Council draft resolution on South Sudan.The draft resolution, adopted by the UN Security Council on Wednesday, renewed the mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) for a year until March 15, 2024.He said that the United States put national positions above the views of the countries concerned or the collective view of the council and even halted consultations and forced a draft through to a vote when differences remained.Dai Bing, the charge d'affaires of China´s permanent mission to the United Nations, criticized the preliminary draft, which allows the mission to ""take all necessary measures"" to ""engage any actor, including the government of South Sudan and its proxies, that is credibly found to be preparing attacks, or engages in attacks, against civilians,"" and also provides that UNMISS doesn't require prior authorization or permission of the government of South Sudan to undertake its mandated tasks.It is not a privilege but a responsibility to serve as a penholder, or lead negotiator, said Dai, adding that China had to abstain from voting.Following strong demands from many Security Council members, including troop-contributing countries to the UNMISS, modifications were made to the contentious elements.Still, there is an overemphasis on the use of force as a preferred means of civilian protection, he said.""Such a mandate is very likely to create new difficulties to the work of UNMISS and will put more than 19,000 peacekeepers in danger,"" he added.A peacekeeping mission is not designed to replace the role of the host country´s government but rather to help it in capacity-building and support it in fulfilling the responsibility to protect civilians, Dai said.Consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except for self-defense or defense of mandates are the basic principles for peacekeeping that shall not be overstepped, he added.Dai said that China´s proposal to help South Sudan address climate change was also rejected in the draft.He said issues such as elections, finance and resource management are a country´s internal affairs.""We urge the relevant member to show the impartiality and inclusiveness as expected of a penholder and make genuine efforts for consensus,"" Dai added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0316/c90000-10223402.html,16,3,2023,usa,pdo
Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? - People's Daily Online,"Explainer: What Chinese modernization would mean for the world? (Xinhua) 11:01, March 11, 2023-- ""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.-- China always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.-- The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For a long time in history, the world was shrouded in the myth that modernization equals Westernization. The emergence of Chinese modernization dispels it, making modernization no longer a single-choice question, but a multiple-choice one.For the world, China´s task to modernize a country of 1.4 billion people, or nearly one-fifth of the global population, is unprecedented. The Herculean pursuit not only captures global attention, but also has global ramifications.Among a series of concepts and initiatives that China promotes in both state governance and global interactions, the Chinese path to modernization is the most popular keyword that people would like to know more about, according to an overseas survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency recently.WHAT ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHINESE AND WESTERN MODERNIZATION?China´s path to modernization is one of peace and development, win-win cooperation, and harmony between humanity and nature, rather than external expansion and plundering.""China´s path to modernization reflects Chinese wisdom, Chinese civilization and history,"" said Keith Bennett, a long-term China specialist and vice chair of Britain´s 48 Group Club.""The modernization of a small number of Western countries was based on the exploitation, oppression and colonization of almost the entire world. China is not developing by exploiting any other country; China is developing itself and modernizing itself, and at the same time helping other countries to develop and modernize,"" he said.China does not seek to exploit or control other nations, and it plays no role in inciting conflicts, said Mokhtar Gobashy, deputy chairman of the Cairo-based Arab Center for Political and Strategic Studies, adding that´s why China has gained respect and popularity in the Arab world.Meanwhile, Chinese modernization emphasizes both material and cultural-ethical advancement, which distinguishes it from Western modernization, said Chen Gang, assistant director of the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore.The coordination of material and cultural-ethical advancement leads the way to realize all-around material abundance as well as people´s well-rounded development, Chen said.WHAT CHINESE MODERNIZATION CAN OFFER FOR THE WORLD?China stands in the world as the second-largest economy and a responsible major country. It always keeps the world´s development and peace in mind in its modernization process. That is because Beijing fully understands that it will do well only if the world does well, and vice versa.Firstly, China is committed to making the world less poor and more equitable.By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.Commenting on China´s poverty reduction drive, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said those achievements are ""the biggest contribution for dramatical reduction of poverty.""More than eradicating absolute poverty, Chinese modernization promotes common prosperity, thereby shrinking the enormous wealth gap and inequality that have risen in tandem with Western modernization.British scholar and political commentator Martin Jacques highlighted China´s pursuit of common prosperity, lamenting how Western countries have never taken it seriously.""For China to embrace common prosperity, to establish a society of greater fairness, greater equity, that is a very important message not only to China, Chinese people but to the world as well,"" he said.China, on its way toward modernization, has also been sharing its development dividends with the rest of the world.Take the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to a World Bank forecast, if all Belt and Road transport infrastructure projects are carried out, the initiative would generate 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars of global revenues annually to 2030. Up to 90 percent of the revenues would go to partner countries.""The most important thing about the BRI is that developing nations could benefit from the great experience in the development of China. BRI gives them the opportunity to create an industrial society and join the modern age. This is something that in the long run would bode well for the future of humanity,"" said Khairy Tourk, professor of economics with the Stuart School of Business at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.Secondly, China is committed to making the world greener and more biodiverse.China ranks first globally in the area of planted forests and forest coverage growth, contributing a quarter of the world´s new forest area in the past decade.From 2012 to 2021, China´s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP declined by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal.So far, China has also emerged as a major proponent of renewable energy, and it is working hard to capitalize on the potential of a green BRI.UNFCCC (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Executive Secretary Simon Stiell spoke highly of China´s firm and consistent stance on actively addressing climate change, as well as its efforts to translate climate commitments into concrete actions.At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis, China continues to make solid progress in dealing with climate change and plays an important role in advancing the global response to climate change, Stiell said.Meanwhile, under China´s presidency, the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the global biodiversity framework ahead of schedule. China has shown leadership in global biodiversity protection, Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, has said.Thirdly, China is committed to making the world more peaceful.For more than 70 years, China has never started a war, never occupied a single square mile of foreign territory, never engaged in proxy wars, and never been a member of or organized any military bloc.It is the only country that has incorporated peaceful development in its Constitution, and the only country among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge no first use of nuclear weapons. China´s track record on peace can stand the scrutiny of history, and its peaceful rise is an unprecedented miracle in human history.Since China´s restoration of its lawful seat at the United Nations in 1971, China has actively participated in the political settlement of major regional hot issues, including the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and the Palestine-Israel issue.In response to mounting conflicts and security challenges in today´s world, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022.And in the GSI Concept Paper released last month, China further expounded the core ideas and principles of the initiative, identified the priorities, platforms and mechanisms of cooperation and demonstrated China´s sense of responsibility for safeguarding world peace and firm resolve to defend global security.""China´s idea of being a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods are consistent with the ideals of the UN Charter,"" former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said.People visit Jianchang ancient city during the Spring Festival holiday in Xichang, southwest China´s Sichuan Province, on Jan. 27, 2023. (Photo by Li Jieyi/Xinhua)AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH?Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization,"" presents another picture of modernization, expands the channels for developing countries to achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity, Xi once said.China´s rise as a global economic power shattered the long-held notion that modernization means Westernization, said David Monyae, director of the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg.The Chinese path to modernization serves as an ""example"" for developing countries, especially African countries, when they have been confronted with multiple crises that hinder their development in recent years, General Secretary of the Congolese Labor Party Pierre Moussa has said.""They could find in this model elements for the construction of a development path that can enable them to handle present and future challenges,"" he said.""Modernization has never been simply Westernization,"" Chen said, adding that ""Chinese modernization is a new development model, which can be used as a reference for other countries with similar national conditions or at a similar stage of development."" ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220417.html,11,3,2023,usa,pdo
Decoupling a wrong path leading nowhere - People's Daily Online,"Decoupling a wrong path leading nowhereBy China Daily editorial (Chinadaily.com.cn) 10:14, March 15, 2023By highlighting the record high trade volume between China and the United States last year, nearly $760 billion, Premier Li Qiang gave a to-the-point reply to a question on the Joe Biden administration´s attempts to decouple the world´s two largest economies at his first news conference in Beijing on Monday, two days after taking up his post.Li´s previous long-term work experience in Shanghai granted him many opportunities to have contact with senior executives of US enterprises operating in China. The confidence and interest that the US business community expressed in the Chinese economy and market, he said, consolidated his view that there is much potential to be tapped in China-US cooperation.His remarks should serve to convey a clear message to the US side that China will maintain its policy continuity to weave the Chinese economy deeper into the fabric of the global industry and supply chains.The dramatic rise in foreign direct investment in China over the past three years, when the US intensified its decoupling and containment practices targeting China and when the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of regional geopolitical tensions were seriously taking their toll on the world economy, should also awaken Washington to the fact that what it is acting against is not a ""China threat"" but the overall trend of economic globalization.The question Li raised at the news conference — How many people are actually benefitting from the US' decoupling practices? — deserves an answer from Washington. What threatens the US' national security and interests is its institutional maladies, not China´s development. Yet Washington is so consumed by its partisan struggles that no efforts are made to address these. China is only a convenient scapegoat for the US politicians to divert domestic attention from the country´s true challenges and to build cliques to protect its hegemony.The Biden administration put 28 Chinese entities on its Entity List on March 2 citing violations of its sanctions, which is nothing but typical long-arm jurisdiction, and blacklisted another 24 Chinese enterprises and one individual for the same reason on March 9. The message from the US side is clear, Washington is intent on walking farther down the wrong path in its China policy.As Foreign Minister Qin Gang has warned, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation if the US does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path. In its haste to reach its objective, Washington is taking a reckless gamble which puts at stake the fundamental interests of the two peoples and even the future of humanity.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222555.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo

(Xinhua/Li Yibo)BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China´s sci-fi blockbuster ""The Wandering Earth II"" and ""Three-Body"" TV drama have lately gained considerable attention on the internet.These productions feature Chinese themes and showcase the country´s unique imagination and culture, contributing to the growth of China´s sci-fi industry by instilling confidence and vigor.Directed by Guo Fan and starring Andy Lau and Li Xuejian, ""The Wandering Earth II"" -- a prequel to the 2019 sci-fi blockbuster ""The Wandering Earth"" -- tells the story of humanity building enormous engines to propel Earth to a new solar system as the sun rapidly burns out.Since its release on Jan. 22, the movie has earned over 4 billion yuan (about 579 million U.S. dollars) at the box office, according to box office tracker Maoyan. As of March 10, it has also been released in 23 countries and regions, including the United States, Canada, Singapore and Malaysia.Renowned Chinese sci-fi writer and Hugo Award winner, Liu Cixin, said that China´s rapid development and its modernization process have provided fertile ground for the growth and evolution of Chinese science fiction.Guo explained that people are exposed to news of Chinese astronauts engaging in extravehicular activities and China´s lunar probes landing on the moon, making them more receptive to the futuristic scenes depicted in sci-fi movies.He added that scientific and technological progress has provided a realistic basis for sci-fi literature and art, while economic development has provided a sizeable cultural consumption market for sci-fi creation.In recent years, China has released various documents on promoting sci-fi movies. A document, jointly issued in 2020 by the China Association for Science and Technology and the China Film Administration, emphasized the significance of sci-fi movies as a catalyst for the high-quality development of Chinese films.Several major Chinese cities, including Chengdu in Sichuan Province, have taken significant steps to boost the development of their sci-fi industries. Known as the home of pandas, the city is also the cradle of ""Science Fiction World,"" China´s most popular sci-fi periodical.In addition to this, the city has been selected to host the 81st World Science Fiction Convention in 2023, a testament to its growing reputation as a hub of sci-fi culture and creativity.The 2022 China sci-fi industry report, jointly compiled by the Beijing-based China Science Fiction Research Center and the Research Center for Science and Human Imagination under the Southern University of Science and Technology in south China´s Guangdong Province, was launched in February this year.The report analyzed the four primary business sectors of China´s sci-fi industry and revealed that in 2021, the industry´s total revenue was 82.96 billion yuan, up 50.5 percent year on year, maintaining steady growth.In 2021, sci-fi games made the maximum contribution to the industry with a revenue of 67 billion yuan, up 39.6 percent year on year. The total revenue of the sci-fi film and TV industry hit 7.19 billion yuan, increasing 171.4 percent year on year, according to the report.Wu Yan, a professor at Southern University of Science and Technology, pointed out that several sci-fi-related policies and awards have been introduced and implemented, and many new films and videos have been launched, which have generated new opportunities and bolstered confidence in the development of China´s sci-fi industry.Industry insiders acknowledge that there is still significant work to be done to further industrialize the sci-fi sector and cultivate talent to support its continued development.Bringing imaginative stories to life requires a robust and well-established film industry, not just in terms of equipment and technology, but also in terms of the process and standards, Guo said.Following the filming of ""The Wandering Earth,"" Guo´s studio and the Beijing Film Academy joined forces to establish a film industrialization lab aimed at promoting the adoption of standardized management and operational processes across the film industry.""The goal we are pursuing is no longer to create beautiful individual shots, but to develop a process capable of managing the production of thousands of shots at a relatively high quality,"" Guo said.Wang Ting, director of the China Research Institute for Science Popularization, said that as China accelerates its efforts to become a scientific and technological powerhouse, it is necessary to use imaginative education as a strong support to cultivate talent in the field of innovation.However, despite the growing demand for talent in the domestic sci-fi industry, there remains a shortage of skilled professionals in this field, Wang added.To address the issue, industry insiders suggest that sci-fi education should be introduced in primary and middle schools, where possible, and a communication platform for sci-fi creators and people who work in the fields of science and technology should be set up, among other measures.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224490.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo

Chinese movie star Yen expresses his pride over nation's amazing progress - People's Daily Online,"Chinese movie star Yen expresses his pride over nation´s amazing progressBy ZOU SHUO (China Daily) 08:26, March 06, 2023Donnie Yen talks with fellow members in the cultural sector of the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference during a panel discussion on Sunday in Beijing. [Photo by Jiang Dong /China Daily]Renowned Chinese movie star Donnie Yen has spoken of just how proud he is to be Chinese and feels amazed at the progress his home country has made.Yen, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, said: ""Most of the people outside of China don't see it until they are there. The progress — the freeways, the architecture, the convenience of lifestyle.""He made the remarks in a recent interview with British GQ magazine, adding the modernization of other countries he has been to is not even close to China.However, Yen told the magazine that he is upset that the Western media focuses only on the negative stories about China.""The BBC, CNN, they never talk about that. They never mention the true side of it,"" he said.Yen went on to say the 2019 protest in Hong Kong was actually a riot.""A lot of people might not be happy with what I'm saying, but I'm speaking from my own experience.""He recalled when he moved to Boston with his father and the difficulties of adapting to life in the United States as new immigrants when he was 10.""Today we talk about injustice, back in the days, you can't imagine. It was horrendous,"" he said.Throughout his career, Hollywood has never quite known what to do with him or with any Asian leading men, he said, adding that he found his opportunities limited.While in China, he can play drug lords, animated monkeys, romantic leads and soldiers, but in Hollywood, he had to settle for the same handful of tired old stereotypes: the sage warrior, the stern general and the one-dimensional villain, he said.Yen said he had to suggest making his character blind and giving him a sense of humor when he was approached by Disney to appear in the 2016 Star Wars prequel Rogue One to avoid making it another cliche.In addition, while making John Wick: Chapter 4, his character was originally named Shang or Chang, a generic name for Asian actors and he was supposed to wear mandarin collars. It was due to his influence that the director agreed to change the name and wardrobe, he said.Yen said he is more selective with the Hollywood movies that he takes on and he will ask if the role is generic or respectful of Chinese culture before taking a role.While he was hungrier to prove himself at a younger age, he is no longer overexcited by offers from Hollywood and turns down roles if he is not allowed creative control, he said.Yen said he was energized to see Michelle Yeoh win a Golden Globe for Everything Everywhere All at Once this year and believes there will always be more people like Yeoh.He is also upbeat because he sees a ""big difference"" in the way he and other Asian actors are treated in Hollywood.One of the great things about cinema is it is unifying, transcending barriers of language and culture. ""Action movies are a genre that everybody in the world can appreciate,"" he added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0306/c90000-10216898.html,06,3,2023,usa,pdo
Interview: China's path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China´s path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist (Xinhua) 11:56, March 11, 2023LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China has blazed a path to modernization that suits its society and harmonizes with the environment, a renowned British sociologist has said.""There are two things (about the Chinese path to modernization) which stand out for me: the scale of the task with such a large population on one side, harmony with nature on the other,"" Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.Albrow said that, given the sheer size of China´s population, the amazing pace of its modernization has greatly impressed him.Harmony between humanity and nature is a theme that goes back millennia into Chinese history, the sociologist said. ""It shows that the emphasis China gives to that means that modernization does not discard the past; it adopts the past and carries the past forward.""""Modernization is congruent with the culture of China itself,"" Albrow said.The Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development, he said.Albrow explained that modernization means applying science and technology to human organizations.""On the back of the development of modern technologies, modernization allows countries to take their own culture forward,"" he said. ""Every country is able to develop modernity in the way that suits its own culture.""""China has given an example to the world of how you can have a culturally-led modernization program,"" he added.Albrow, author of the book China and the Shared Human Future: Exploring Common Values and Goals, said that as the world turns its attention to the ongoing ""two sessions"" held in Beijing, it´s important for China to demonstrate that ""democracy comes in many different forms"" and that ""China is moving forward all the time.""The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual meetings of the National People´s Congress, the country´s national legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.""The Chinese version of democracy is one which enlists the support of the whole population, through the efforts of the Communist Party of China to produce a coherent approach to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""China´s form of democracy is an evolving form of discussion and debate, but one which is built upon the consensus of society as a whole.""""It´s a profound kind of democracy and very different from the kinds which exist in so many Western countries, the kinds of democracies that exist, for instance, (in) the United Kingdom or the United States, ones which tend to produce disagreements"" and make it difficult for a country to take any single path into the future, despite its continual debate and discussion about how to go forward, according to Albrow.""Democracy is not a stable condition; democracy is something which is continually moving forward,"" he continued, adding that ""China is in a position now, in this particular 'two sessions', to take us forward again, with well-judged reforms of its own system.""Albrow is confident in the CPC´s resolve to further reforms that will remove institutional obstacles to fulfill Chinese modernization. Over the past decades, the CPC has shown the courage to develop and introduce changes and reforms, he said.

"NPC deputies, national political advisors call to better protect women’s rights - People's Daily Online","NPC deputies, national political advisors call to better protect women’s rights (Global Times) 09:05, March 09, 2023On International Women´s Day, the Global Times learned that some Chinese national lawmakers and political advisors have submitted their motions and proposals to the ongoing national two sessions, calling for better protecting women´s rights and improving women´s living and working conditions.Recently, the topic of discrimination against women in employment is resonating with a large number of netizens. Analysts believe fear of salary reduction, dismissal, impact on probation and promotion and salary increases are the main concerns of pregnant female employees.Zhang Guangdong, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), submitted a proposal calling to implement an employment guarantee policy for women of childbearing age.According to Zhang´s proposal obtained by the Global Times on Wednesday, Zhang proposed to implement the existing employment security policy for women of childbearing age at the legal level, further clarify the scope of compensation for infringement of women´s equal employment rights, and appropriately increase the amount of compensation for mental damage, so as to play an effective warning and punishment role for employers who violate the rules.Zhang said China should set up special agencies in departments to supervise enterprises in establishing equal payment systems for equal work and fair promotion systems to ensure that national and local policies on protecting women´s rights are implemented.Separately, a senior mathematician who is also a national political advisor urged for breaking the glass ceiling for women in science sector and more women´s participation in the field of science and technology to improve gender equality in the field.According to a proposal the Global Times obtained from Yuan Yaxiang, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), also vice-president of the China Association for Science and Technology, women have great intellectual potential in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and are a key force in the development of scientific and technological innovation.At present, women´s participation in STEM fields is far from sufficient. Yuan said the minimum proportion of female scientific and technological talents should be stipulated and increased in scientific and technological decision-making units such as academic committees at all levels and project and talent title review groups, to enhance women´s voices in the field.Yuan proposed increasing the level of support for women for professional title promotion, project reviews, awards and other aspects. And the upper age limits of talent programs and projects should be relaxed for women.Authorities should formulate preferential policies to encourage female scientists to take charge of high-level and major projects, support and train more high-level female scientific and technological talents and reserve teams in a bid to break the glass ceiling for women in STEM fields.China has always paid high attention to continuously improving equal rights and opportunities for women.On Tuesday, Lin Yi, Vice-Chairperson of National Working Committee on Children and Women under the State Council, addressed UN Security Council´s open debate that that China is a champion of gender equality and a campaigner for women´s empowerment. In the process of promoting Chinese modernization, the status of Chinese women has undergone earth-shaking changes, with a growing sense of fulfillment, happiness and security, Lin said.Lin noted that China calls on the international community to increase input and speed up the implementation of the commitment of the Agenda for Women´s Peace and Security, and inject new impetus into the global cause of gender equality and women´s development.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219170.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo

"China provides food for thought as Saudi Arabia, Iran restore ties: experts - People's Daily Online","China provides food for thought as Saudi Arabia, Iran restore ties: experts (Xinhua) 10:59, March 14, 2023BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to restore diplomatic relations and reopen their embassies and missions within two months after China-mediated talks in Beijing last week.Observers said the surprise deal sets a good example for how countries in the region can resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation, and represents the contribution that China, as a responsible major power, can make to a turbulent world.Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran in early 2016 in protest against the attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran following the Saudi execution of a Shiite cleric. Iraq and Oman hosted multiple rounds of dialogue between 2021 and 2022 to help the two rivals mend ties.After their latest meeting in Beijing, both Saudi Arabia and Iran extended their appreciation and thanks to Iraq and Oman, and to Chinese leaders and the Chinese government for hosting, supporting and contributing to the success of the talks.""The deal brought great surprise to the Middle East and the world, not only because the two old enemies made peace after years of antagonism, but also because the dialogue took place thousands of kilometers away in Beijing. It was a diplomatic miracle that most people had not expected,"" said Ding Long, a professor at the Shanghai International Studies University.Countries in the Middle East, including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan and Iraq, welcomed the Beijing agreement. The United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric applauded the agreement and praised China´s role in the process, saying ""good neighborly relations"" between Iran and Saudi Arabia are ""essential"" for the stability of the Gulf region.Relations between regional powers have eased since 2020. Iran has restored diplomatic relations with the UAE and Kuwait, creating a favorable atmosphere for the resumption of its diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia.Given sectarian, ethnic and geopolitical factors, the Saudi Arabia-Iran relationship has become one of the most complex examples of bilateral relations in the world. China´s mediation helped secure the normalization of ties, pushing the process of defusing tension in the Middle East to a climax, Ding said.""Of the global powers, only China is capable of and in the position to handle the issue. Compared with Western countries, China maintains friendship and balance with all countries in the Middle East, and does not take sides. Therefore, China gains credibility as a mediator,"" said Niu Xinchun, director of the Institute of Middle East Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.Iran will not accept U.S. mediation, and Russia, despite its ties to both Iran and Saudi Arabia, is distracted by the crisis in Ukraine, Niu said.China´s head of state visited the two rivaling countries in 2016, and paid another state visit to Saudi Arabia in late 2022. President of Iran Ebrahim Raisi paid a state visit to China in February this year.""The fact that these two countries chose China in which to reach such an agreement is a sign of trust in China and highlights China´s influence in the world,"" said Wu Sike, former special envoy from China to the Middle East. ""Another sign is that China´s policy in the Middle East has been recognized by regional countries for many years.""China has repeatedly said it pursues no selfish interest whatsoever in the Middle East, and China respects the status of Middle Eastern countries as the masters of their region and opposes geopolitical competition in the Middle East.""China has no intention to and will not seek to fill the so-called vacuum or put up exclusive blocs,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said after the Saudi Arabia-Iran talks, adding that China has always believed that the future of the Middle East should always be in the hands of the countries in the region.Experts said the outcome of the talks is of great significance to resolving other international conflicts, and that the China-proposed Global Security Initiative has won international recognition. The initiative aims to create a new path to security that features dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliance, and win-win cooperation over zero-sum games.""Whether in Ukraine, Yemen or Syria, an important reason for long-standing conflicts is foreign intervention,"" Niu said.

European experts question unusual silence over Nord Stream blasts - People's Daily Online,"European experts question unusual silence over Nord Stream blasts (Xinhua) 08:41, March 07, 2023This aerial photo released by the Danish Ministry of Defense on Sept. 27, 2022 shows the Nord Stream gas pipeline leak site. (Danish Defense Ministry/Handout via Xinhua)Germany, has been particularly affected by the energy crisis due to the end of gas supplies from Russia. However, the country´s government, like its allies, has refrained from talking about the explosions in public.BERLIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite their own heavy losses, European countries -- especially Germany -- have unanimously kept silent over the blasts that destroyed the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines last September and subsequent investigations.Since veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh exposed the U.S. Navy´s involvement in the explosions on the U.S. portal Substack last month, more and more experts have questioned Europe´s atypical, collective silence.According to Hersh, a U.S. Pulitzer Prize winner, the U.S. Navy divers last June planted the remotely triggered explosives that destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines months later.Europe´s largest economy, Germany, has been particularly affected by the energy crisis due to the end of gas supplies from Russia. However, the country´s government, like its allies, has refrained from talking about the explosions in public.Picture taken on Oct. 8, 2012 shows Nord Stream pipeline equipments before the opening ceremony of the North Stream second gas link in Portovaya bay, some 60 kilometers from the town of Vyborg in northwestern Russia.

At the same time, German media have widely moved to discredit Hersh´s article.Once proven that the pipelines were indeed blasted by the United States, it would overturn the European public´s recognition of the current narratives by the West, which claimed that European infrastructure was ""under the threat of Russia,"" said Li Xing, professor of development and international relations at Denmark´s Aalborg University.That the U.S. Navy was involved in the Nord Stream pipelines explosions last year, as discovered by Hersh, was an ""economic war"" against its submissive allies in Europe, Jan Oberg, a Swedish expert, told Xinhua in an interview.""One must wonder when the Europeans will wake up and finally understand that they no longer share interests with the U.S.,"" stressed Oberg, director of the Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research.Photo taken in Arlington of Virginia, the United States, shows a screen displaying U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (not pictured) attending a press conference at the White House in Washington, D.C.

Theoretically, the United States is certainly interested in stopping the delivery of Russian energy to the European market and supplying its own, including LNG, even if it is 25-30 percent more expensive than Russia´s,"" Putin said in an interview with a Russian TV program.""It is challenging for us to conduct our own investigation if we are not allowed to the site of this terrorist attack. The fact that this is a terrorist attack is no longer a secret to anyone. In my opinion, everyone has already recognized this. Moreover, the terrorist attack was clearly committed at the state level because no amateurs can carry out such actions,"" Putin said.""An explosion of this kind, of such power, at such a depth can only be carried out by specialists and supported by all the might of a country with certain technologies,"" he explained.Russia requested the Danish authorities check the Nord Stream pipelines as explosive devices could still be planted there, but ""the answer was vague ... They said that we have to wait,"" Putin said.Putin believes the Nord Stream still has a future if European partners care about national interests.""In world practice, there is no example of repairing such a system after such an incident, but theoretically, everything is possible,"" adding, ""It would take time, money, and some new technologies.""In an article published last month, Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh revealed that the United States partnered with Norway in a top-secret operation in June 2022 to plant remotely triggered explosives that took out three of the four Nord Stream pipelines three months later. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10222953.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo
Interview: China women's basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China women´s basketball coach aims high at Paris 2024 Olympics (Xinhua) 13:33, March 09, 2023BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Making the move from player to head coach in women´s basketball is no easy feat, to say nothing of making it to the final of a World Cup as both a player and a head coach.So Zheng Wei has many reasons to be proud of herself.The current head coach of China´s women´s basketball team steered her squad to second place at the FIBA Women´s World Cup last year, tying the country´s best record in the tournament. She was also part of the China team which reached the final of the World Championships in 1994.In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Zheng told her story of getting over regrets during a career spanning 28 years.UNFORGETTABLE FIBA 2022 WORLD CUPDuring the last Olympic cycle, China were widely considered serious medal contenders at major world competitions, but failed to prove their prowess at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.""In Tokyo, we were rallied past and eliminated by Serbia,"" Zheng recalled.What made the year 2021 even more poignant for Zheng´s team was that they were defeated by Japan in the Asian Cup final.""Because of these setbacks my players really wanted to move a step forward and reach a new level,"" said Zheng.For Zheng, the underperformance was somehow reminiscent of the 1994 World Championships, where China missed out on the title after losing to Brazil in the final.""It was the closest China´s women´s basketball team had ever come to winning the world title. We defeated Australia to set up a final showdown with Brazil,"" said Zheng.""We had never lost to Brazil in previous games, so we felt like we were already the world champions.""But because we were mentally unprepared and too eager for success, we didn't play our best in that game and left with regrets,"" she added.28 years later, Zheng made up for her regrets, even though the young China side she coached also finished runners-up at the World Cup after losing to the United States in the final.Speaking of last year´s World Cup journey, Zheng mentioned the quarterfinal against France and the semifinal against Australia as the two most unforgettable games, as the former represented a breakthrough for the team, while the latter showcased her players' tenacity and resilience.""It was the best game that France played throughout the World Cup. Their shooting percentage was very high, and it was tough,"" said Zheng.""But our players had prepared for that moment for years. Everyone held their breath and didn't want to leave with regrets.""After breaking through this barrier, the players became more confident,"" she added.In the match against hosts Australia, China withstood pressure even though they were playing without top scorer Li Meng.""When the opportunity came, everyone´s determination to move forward did not change. Although Li Meng did not play, everyone else stepped up and took responsibility,"" Zheng noted.""I think it was willpower that helped us. Australia were a more experienced team, but by the fourth quarter, they couldn't keep up with us.""From the group stage to the final, Zheng´s players kept surprising her with fantastic performances. ""Maybe after breaking through that window, they couldn't be stopped. They did their best to present both technique and spirit on the court. I think there was no regret this time,"" said Zheng.CHINA MOVING TO THE TOPBasking in World Cup glory, Zheng urged her players to stay calm and work harder.""We only made it to the final in this tournament. It might come just by chance,"" said Zheng.""But if we are a genuinely top team like the USA, Australia, France and Spain, we need to prove ourselves in every competition.""A lack of experience is China´s biggest weakness, which often led to inconsistent play in the knockout stages, said Zheng.To change the situation, she stressed the importance of building up a more competitive professional league in China and scheduling more high-quality international friendlies for the national team.Zheng summarized the trend of women´s basketball as ""a more physical game with more vaguely defined positions, fiercer defense, more intensive body contact and better individual techniques.""""I believe we are approaching our goals on the right track through training,"" she said.TEAMWORK IS CHINA'S TRADITIONHaving served as an assistant coach of China´s national team for 12 years before taking charge as the head coach, Zheng is deeply impressed by the team´s tradition of teamwork.""Unity, cooperation, selfless dedication, and never giving up are the glorious traditions of China´s women´s basketball team,"" Zheng said.""Shao Ting and Sun Mengran have passed them on to Yang Liwei and Li Meng, and the latter are passing onto the next generation.""Zheng said that she also had good cooperation with her predecessors and learned a lot from them.""I had been analyzing opponents' strategies for the team before, so I am very familiar with both our players and our main opponents. What I can do is bring out the players' strength and make them more confident,"" she said.BALANCING PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL TEAMThe 2022-2023 WCBA league season is set to conclude in mid-March. Zheng confirmed that the national team will assemble at the end of March to begin preparations for this year´s two main events - the Asian Cup and the Asian Games.""We will play the Asian Cup in June, but some of the players who were in last year´s World Cup may not join the team because they have contracts with WNBA teams, so the mission will be tough for us,"" Zheng said.According to Zheng, four or five players, including center Han Xu and veteran Yang Liwei, have contacts with the WNBA. Zheng said she hopes that they can refine themselves in a more competitive league and return to perform better for the national team.Zheng revealed that the Asian Cup and the Asian Games are China´s short-term goal, while their long-term goal is the Paris Olympics in 2024.""We need to combine our preparations with the two goals,"" she said.""We may recruit more young players who can compete in international events. They are eager to play for the national team. We want to observe them and help them grow.""We hope to add one backup to every position. The national team´s roster will include 16 to 18 players this time.""Asked about their prospects at Paris 2024, Zheng said: ""We aim to match our World Cup performance in every major competition in the future. Hopefully we can achieve it.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219392.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Why does China's ""two sessions"" matter to the world? - People's Daily Online","Why does China´s ""two sessions"" matter to the world?By  Rick O'Shea (Xinhua) 08:28, March 05, 2023The opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 4, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhai Jianlan)BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- It is China´s annual ""two sessions"" time again. In the following week or so, for anyone interested in observing and understanding China, the political event is something they don't want to miss.I am an American who has been living in China for four decades. From my point of view, the ""two sessions"" is an important window to learn about China´s current development, understand China´s political system and forecast its future path. During this period, foreigners can find out what hot topics are being discussed on the ground, which issues concern Chinese leaders the most, what development objectives have been set, how China interacts with other countries, etc.The ""two sessions"" refers to the annual sessions of China´s National People´s Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference. They are known as the country´s top legislature and national political advisory body, respectively.A PLATFORM SOLVING PRACTICAL PROBLEMSThe ""two sessions"" is a platform on which different regions and groups voice their opinions and reach a consensus. Lawmakers submit motions and suggestions, while political advisors offer proposals and insights.The origins of many significant laws, regulations and policies that concern various sectors and groups -- such as those in the areas from environmental protection to poverty alleviation, from education to health care, from urban issues to rural issues -- were in the motions and proposals handed by lawmakers and political advisors to the ""two sessions."" The ""two sessions"" also works as a platform that facilitates the resolution of practical problems faced by ordinary Chinese, such as building roads in the countryside, easing extracurricular burdens on students, and protecting the rights of deliverymen, among others.Aerial photo taken on Sept. 17, 2020 shows the Houhai area in Nanshan District of Shenzhen, south China´s Guangdong Province. (Xinhua/Chen Yehua)DECOUPLING FROM CHINA COMES AT A GREAT COSTChina is the world´s second largest economy after the United States. To some extent, to observe China´s ""two sessions"" is actually to observe Chinese economy. One of the major tasks of the ""two sessions"" is to map out China´s annual economic development, set the growth target, and announce macroeconomic policies. And a document called the government work report gives answers to all of them.Although the prospects for the global economy may not look bright this year, China has expressed its confidence by saying that the country´s economy will ""expect an upturn on the whole, and there is a high probability that the growth rate will hit its normal level."" Many of my foreign friends, including those living in the United States, are closely watching what economic target the Chinese government will set for 2023, and what policies and measures will be taken accordingly.The Chinese economy has grown so titanic and so intertwined with the rest of the world that we can't talk about the prospects of the world economy without talking about China. I've heard some Americans argue for decoupling from the Chinese economy, but I think it will come at a great cost. The fact is that China is the world´s most promising market, with a middle-income population of over 400 million. Some agencies predicted that this middle-income group will surpass 800 million in the next 15 years, which is definitely an astonishing figure.Recently I noticed that the IMF lifted its forecast of China´s economic growth rate for 2023 to 5.2 percent. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said it is highly likely that China´s development will be the most important factor in driving global growth in 2023. You would agree with this point if you have seen Beijing´s packed restaurants, shopping malls and cinemas.This aerial photo taken on Nov. 25, 2022 shows country roads leading to Dongmenguan Village winding on mountains in Zhushan Township in Xuan'en County, central China´s Hubei Province. (Photo by Song Wen/Xinhua)CHINESE MODERNIZATION MATTERS TO WORLDThe 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the country´s ruling political party, was convened in October last year. The key congress stressed ""to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization."" As this year marks the first year of this new journey, the new measures that will be unveiled at the ""two sessions"" not only matter to China, but to other countries as well.I am also attracted to topics on China´s rural areas. I have been to China´s countryside many times. After China announced that it eliminated absolute poverty in 2021, I am eager to find out what on earth has happened in the countryside and how it will get better in the future. That is, how will China push forward its rural revitalization? In the past decades, especially in the past ten years, great transformations have happened in China´s rural areas, which may shed light on the path of narrowing the rich-poor gap for other countries.After living in China for such a long time, one thing that I can't ignore is the bluer sky and clearer water. Green development is transforming China. China has been striving to develop new energy industries such as photovoltaics and wind energy after it announced ambitious plans to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Since China has become a world leader in tackling climate change, its future efforts to support new energy development are without doubt under the world´s spotlight.U.S.-CHINA COOPERATION INDISPENSABLE IN MANY SECTORSIn fact, any changes that happen in China will affect other countries directly or indirectly. It is no exaggeration to say that for many American multinational corporations, they have to take Chinese consumers and policies into consideration before making any big decisions. And the ""two sessions"" is a key opportunity to find out valuable information.During the ""two sessions,"" Foreign Minister Qin Gang, former ambassador of China to the United States, will answer questions from the media. U.S.-China relations are no doubt the most important bilateral relationship in the current world, and one of the topics that I personally care most about. I am eager to see how China´s foreign minister will describe this relationship.To me, and I believe it´s true to many Americans as well, if the two leading countries were to lock themselves in confrontation and conflict, it would be a disaster for the world. I believe despite the twists and turns that happened in their bilateral relations in the past several years, there is still a need for cooperation. After all, people of the two countries share the same vision, which is a safe and prosperous world, and a better future for our children. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0305/c90000-10216334.html,05,3,2023,usa,pdo

(Photo by Li Jianguo/Xinhua)The volatility came just days after a stock market selloff that triggered the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), as the concern of systemic contagion spread among the tech industry broadly.SAN FRANCISCO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Shares of First Republic Bank fell more than 65 percent in early trading on Monday morning, causing trades of the company to be halted due to volatility.The volatility came just days after a stock market selloff that triggered the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), as the concern of systemic contagion spread among the tech industry broadly.That implies investor discomfort with the financial institution despite government activity over the weekend to solve the SVB crisis and potential cascading effects, according to a report by the online newspaper TechCrunch.Since the failure of SVB, it appears that many public-market investors want out of smaller banks, despite the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve announced on Sunday that depositors at SVB would be made whole.""In the worst-case scenario, if it triggers a general crisis of confidence in the bank system, customers may tend to withdraw their deposits, investors may selloff their banking stocks, creating a chain of bank runs like a domino effect,"" said Haiyan Yu, a senior investor in Silicon Valley.According to Garry Tan, the president of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, SVB´s failure has a real risk of systemic contagion. ""Its collapse has already instilled fear among founders and management teams to look for safer havens for their remaining cash, which can trigger a bank run on every other smaller bank,"" he said.Tan warned that the shockwave will impact the U.S. technology industry and ""ultimately set back U.S. competitiveness by a decade or more.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0314/c90000-10222064.html,14,3,2023,usa,pdo

"China's whole-process people's democracy vibrant, effective - People's Daily Online","China´s whole-process people´s democracy vibrant, effective (Xinhua) 09:52, March 10, 2023BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- As an American who grew up in the United States and has lived in China for a few decades, I have found a keyword that many people talk about is ""democracy."" Many in the United States think that China is not democratic. In my opinion, seeing is believing. The democracy I've seen in China is vibrant and very effective.Every year at this time, when spring flowers bloom, the ""two sessions"" -- China´s important annual political gatherings -- are held in Beijing, and this year was no exception.In Western countries such as the United States, where democracy and elections are essentially equated, people elect someone and hope for the best. In China, democracy is more than elections. The ""two sessions"" have been a window to showcase the strength and vitality of China´s democracy. Last year before the ""two sessions,"" my colleagues and I had the opportunity to visit a Shanghai community, which gave me a sense of how China´s whole-process people´s democracy works on a daily basis.In Shanghai´s Hongqiao subdistrict, we interviewed Noyan Rona, a Turkish banker and an enthusiastic volunteer. Rona told us that, when approached about a draft revision to the individual income tax law in 2018, he suggested adding the word ""accumulated"" before the individual tax residency threshold of 183 days in a tax year to make the rule more explicit.Rona recalled this story from several years ago with renewed excitement. His suggestion was adopted and written into law, which would influence a lot of foreigners living in China, he proudly told us.I was very curious to know that, for residents like Rona who are keen to offer opinions, in what ways can they have their opinions heard by lawmakers? At a civic center in Hongqiao, we saw a type of red mailbox designed to collect letters of opinion from residents.In fact, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People´s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee set up a community-level contact station at the civic center. The red mailboxes are part of their facility. Draft laws are sent down here so that ordinary citizens can discuss them and have their opinions heard. In other words, the voices of grassroots people will reach the highest legislative body.Since the establishment of the contact station in 2015, 78 draft laws, including the Foreign Investment Law, have been discussed here by residents in Hongqiao and 163 pieces of advice incorporated, including Rona´s suggestion about individual income tax law.I learned from this year´s ""two sessions"" that similar community-level contact stations have been set up across the nation, becoming the ""through train"" for the grassroots voices to reach the national legislature. What I didn't know was that as a foreigner living in China, I also have such rights.Of course, the channels themselves do not guarantee full participation. There is an important role to play for representatives of public opinion at the grassroots. They are the 2.77 million deputies to people´s congresses at all levels nationwide.Deputies would visit organizations and individuals that can vote, hear and collect public opinions, and conduct research for the proposals and suggestions they submit. They would also participate in research trips, seminars, dialogues, and open-day events to talk about issues of public concern. In addition, they would receive training from time to time to enhance their ability to perform their duties.The practice in Hongqiao is very successful. In November 2019, President Xi Jinping visited the civic center while a consultation meeting on a draft law was underway. Xi talked to both the Chinese and foreign residents attending the meeting, and for the first time made the remark that ""People´s democracy is a type of whole-process democracy.""Compared with legislators in the West who make politics their career and usually have a staff and campaign team, NPC deputies come from all walks of life and all 56 ethnic groups in China. Most of them are part-timers, who work and live among their people and therefore understand their needs best.In an interview with Xinhua, Rick Dunham, a U.S. visiting professor at Tsinghua University, pointed out that in the United States, there are more lawyers, doctors, and top managers involved in politics. In China, one finds more grassroots representation including blue-collar workers, farmers and takeaway riders. I would agree with his conclusion that China´s NPC deputies are more representative than U.S. lawmakers.From protecting workers' rights in the food-delivery and car-hailing industries to alleviating the pressure of excessive schoolwork and off-campus tutoring; from solving the financing difficulties of SMEs to protecting the ecology of the Yellow River... Deputies and political advisors collect and sort out the opinions of ordinary people, which often form the basis of their proposals and suggestions. Some of these ideas will be incorporated into relevant laws, regulations, systems, policies, decisions and arrangements.Over the past five years, as I was told, some 18,000 pieces of advice from national lawmakers and political advisors have been adopted by relevant departments of the Chinese central government and over 7,800 policy measures have subsequently been introduced. As a result, many problems have been addressed related to the country´s reform and development and the people´s most urgent needs.In a nutshell, China´s democracy is a whole process that can involve all people. To let the people discuss the affairs of their own and to make sure that the people are in charge are the essence of the ""whole-process people´s democracy.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219808.html,10,3,2023,usa,pdo

Vice premiers Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing and Liu Guozhong attended the press conference. (Xinhua/Li Xin)BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China´s new premier on Monday voiced full confidence in the country´s economic outlook despite challenges and pledged to further expand opening up regardless of external changes.Citing the many factors of uncertainty and instability facing the world economy, Premier Li Qiang told reporters that stabilizing economic growth is a challenging task not just for China but for all countries in the world this year.It is ""no easy task and requires redoubled efforts"" to achieve the economic growth target of around 5 percent in 2023 on a high base of economic output and amid new challenges, Li told a press conference held after the conclusion of the first session of the 14th National People´s Congress, the national legislature.However, the premier said China´s development is supported by multiple advantages, including a vast market, a complete industrial system, abundant human resources, solid foundation for development, and most importantly, notable institutional strength.""I believe the Chinese economy will brave the wind and waves and sail toward a brighter future. I'm full of confidence in that,"" he said, noting that the Chinese economy has been stabilizing and picking up in the past two months.PURSUE PROGRESS WHILE ENSURING STABILITYChina will keep to the general principles of prioritizing stability and pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and push for a turnaround in the country´s overall economic performance this year, Li told reporters.""On stability, the emphasis will be placed on ensuring stable growth, employment and prices, and the key to seeking progress lies in making new advancement in high-quality development,"" he said.China will make good use of policy combinations in the areas of leveraging macro policies, expanding demand, advancing reform and innovation, and preventing and defusing risks, according to the premier.He also vowed to create a level playing field for all kinds of business entities and further support private enterprises in growing and thriving.""The private sector will enjoy a better environment and broader space for development,"" he said, stressing that China´s commitment to the development of the private sector is unequivocal and steadfast.Meanwhile, the premier dismissed concerns over China´s demographic change, saying the country´s ""demographic dividend"" has not disappeared and that its ""talent dividend"" is in the making.""When assessing demographic dividend, we shall not just look at the sheer size of the population but also look at the scale of high-caliber workforce,"" he told reporters, saying that more than 240 million people have received higher education in China, and the average length of education received by newcomers into the workforce has increased to 14 years.PEOPLE-CENTERED DEVELOPMENTLi said the ultimate aim of the work of the Party and the government is to improve the well-being of the people, vowing efforts in various sectors concerning the people´s livelihood from employment to rural development.With 11.58 million college graduates expected to enter the workforce this year, China will continue to pursue an employment-first strategy and increase support in terms of employment services and technical training, the premier said.Li said rural revitalization should be advanced across the board, and that different localities should develop the countryside based on their local conditions.The country will further increase its grain production capacity by focusing on arable land and seeds, Li said, noting that China´s food security is ""well guaranteed on the whole.""""The government will make sure that the rice bowls of 1.4 billion Chinese people will always be firmly held in our own hands,"" he told the press.The premier also pledged efforts to strengthen government building by further transforming government functions and improving its efficiency and conduct.He encouraged officials at all levels to engage more with local communities to learn about what the people need and seek their opinions on the work of the government.""They need to learn from the people and help the people at the grassroots solve problems,"" he said.DOOR TO OPEN WIDERThis year marks the 45th anniversary of China´s reform and opening up, which has not only developed China but also influenced the world, Li said.He said China will further expand opening up this year in alignment with high-standard international trade rules, opening its door wider to the world with better business environment and services.""Opening up is a basic state policy of China, and no matter how the external situation evolves, China will stick to pursuing this policy,"" the premier told the press, saying that China welcomes investors from all over the world.China has remained a favored destination for global investment, Li said, citing statistics that foreign direct investment into the Chinese mainland, in actual use, reached a record high of more than 189 billion U.S. dollars in 2022.Commenting on China-U.S. relations, the premier refuted the hype in the United States on ""decoupling"" with China, saying that the two countries can and must cooperate and will achieve a lot by working together.""Encirclement and suppression are in no one´s interests,"" he said, noting that the two countries are closely intertwined economically and have both benefited from the other side´s development.PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES, SUPPORT HK, MACAOOn cross-Strait cooperation and communication, Li said the early restoration of normal exchanges and regular cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is a shared aspiration and requires joint efforts of both sides.The Chinese mainland will continue to promote economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Strait on the basis of the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, Li noted, expressing the hope that more Taiwan compatriots and businesses will come to the mainland.""We hope they are not just willing to come to the mainland, but also able to integrate into the local

China pursues self-reliant sci-tech progress to benefit all - People's Daily Online,"China pursues self-reliant sci-tech progress to benefit all (Xinhua) 08:33, March 07, 2023BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of national legislators and political advisors are in Beijing for annual sessions that will set key development agenda of China for the year and beyond. Achieving self-reliance and self-improvement in science and technology has been a heatedly discussed topic as the country aims for high-quality development driven by innovation.Not far from the main venue of the sessions, the Great Hall of the People, a popular exhibition is being staged at the National Museum of China to showcase the progress of the country´s manned space program over 30 years, precisely illustrating how China has accomplished in sci-tech self-reliance as well as benefits it has brought to the world.SELF-RELIANT BUT OPENAccording to a government work report submitted Sunday for the national legislators to deliberate, breakthroughs have been made in core technologies in key fields, and a series of innovations have emerged in areas such as manned spaceflight, lunar and Martian exploration, deep-sea and deep-earth probes, supercomputers, satellite navigation, quantum information, nuclear power technology, airliner manufacturing and artificial intelligence.In late 2022, China´s space station Tiangong entered the new phase of application and development. It now features a basic three-module configuration consisting of the core module named Tianhe, and two lab modules, Wentian and Mengtian.The construction of the space station benefits from China´s system of pooling national resources and strengths. Hundreds of thousands of scientific researchers have participated in the program, inspired by the spirit of self-reliance and independent innovation. The self-development rate of key components of the space station reached 100 percent.Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions the importance of self-reliance and self-improvement in science and technology.Speeding up efforts to achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology is the path China must take to advance high-quality development, said Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, while attending a deliberation with his fellow deputies from the delegation of Jiangsu Province on Sunday at the ongoing first session of the 14th National People´s Congress (NPC), China´s national legislature.To open up new areas and new arenas in development and foster new growth drivers and new strengths in face of fierce international competition, China should ultimately rely on scientific and technological innovation, he said.Building self-reliance and strength in science and technology is key to building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects within the set time frame, Xi added.The nation´s achievements in space exploration, with the space station construction as an outstanding example, reflect the strength of innovation in China, said Wang Xiaojun, head of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology and a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.Sci-tech empowerment is a prominent symbol of China´s high-quality development, while sci-tech innovation has become an important driving force for Chinese modernization, Wang added.The country moved up to the 11th place in the 2022 Global Innovation Index and firmly remains the only middle-income economy in the top 30, according to the latest ranking published by the World Intellectual Property Organization.China´s spending on research and development totaled 3.087 trillion yuan (about 445 billion U.S. dollars) in 2022, an increase of 10.4 percent over the previous year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Not only does the perseverance with self-reliance advance the sci-tech development of China, but it also creates more opportunities for global cooperation.In its manned space program, China has signed agreements and carried out cooperation projects with France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and many space agencies and organizations. Its Tiangong space station is the first of its kind open to all UN member states.In a cooperation program with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, projects from 17 countries have been included in the first batch of Tiangong´s experiments in aerospace medicine, life sciences and biotechnology, microgravity physics and combustion science, astronomy and other emerging technologies.China is fully aware that independent innovation should never exclude international cooperation.THE GLOBAL CHAINSelf-reliance in science and technology has helped Chinese high-tech enterprises to forge their core competitiveness, and enabled them to become an essential part in the global innovative industrial chain.Located in Ningde, east China´s Fujian Province, battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) is now operating at full capacity, with its blue battery cells to be shipped to automakers worldwide, including BMW, Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo.Founded in 2011, CATL has ranked first in the world in terms of the usage of its power battery system for six consecutive years, and also in the shipment of its energy storage battery for two consecutive years.To get more deeply involved in global industrial cooperation, CATL has built power battery production plants in Thuringia of Germany and Debrecen of Hungary. In February, it confirmed that it would work with Ford Motor Company on the latter´s lithium iron phosphate battery plant in the U.S. state of Michigan, providing technology and service support to the new plant.In 2022, China´s foreign trade withstood the impact of multiple unexpected factors, with exports of EVs, photovoltaic (PV) products and lithium batteries growing by 131.8 percent, 67.8 percent and 86.7 percent, respectively.According to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, China´s global market share of PV polysilicon, lithium battery cells and modules exceeded 70 percent in 2021.""China today is the biggest driver of clean energy technologies,"" Fatih Birol, chief of the International Energy Agency, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.Zou Ming, an NPC deputy and a senior engineer with the Panzhihua Iron and Steel Research Institute, said that enterprises should give full play to the major role of innovation and transform sci-tech innovation into the biggest driving force on the Chinese path to modernization.BENEFITS FOR ALLWhile adhering to independent innovation, China has been actively promoting sci-tech sharing and exchanges, aiming to benefit all mankind.The contribution of scientific and technological progress to the country´s economic growth has exceeded 60 percent, said the government work report.In February, a group of guests from Mexico came to Fujian Province to study the technology of ""Juncao,"" an economical and environmentally friendly substitute for timber as a substrate for growing mushrooms.Discovered by Chinese scientists, Juncao is famed as ""magic grass,"" as it is particularly suitable for developing countries to improve their agriculture and reduce poverty.It is becoming a new sustainable industry in countries and regions along the Belt and Road and has been introduced to 106 countries, creating hundreds of thousands of job opportunities and helping to alleviate poverty.At a UN meeting in 2019, former President of the General Assembly Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces described Juncao as ""emblematic of China´s Belt and Road Initiative,"" which, according to the World Bank´s estimates, could contribute to lifting 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million out of moderate poverty.China has also hosted a large number of international students learning about the Juncao technology. So far, the country has held 310 international training sessions on the technology, both at home and abroad, training more than 10,000 people.When chairing a group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee last month, Xi noted that efforts should be made to enhance openness, trust and cooperation in the international sci-tech community to make new and greater contributions to the progress of human civilization.China has established sci-tech cooperation relations with more than 160 countries and regions, and signed 116 inter-governmental agreements on sci-tech cooperation.In 2022, China signed or renewed 25 international sci-tech cooperation documents, and carried out fruitful cooperation with many countries in multiple fields, including COVID-19 control, biodiversity, climate change and clean energy.The country´s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope has been available for scientists worldwide since April 1, 2021. Meanwhile, products, technologies and services related to the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System have been applied in more than half of all countries around the world.After the recent devastating earthquake hit Türkiye, China quickly deployed several satellites to help analyze the disaster situation and allocate relief resources.Sci-tech progress will make China better prepared for international sci-tech cooperation, and the country will continue to contribute to global sci-tech development for the benefit of humanity.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0307/c90000-10217514.html,07,3,2023,usa,pdo
Britain takes the low road by following U.S. footsteps in accusing China of everything - People's Daily Online,"Britain takes the low road by following U.S. footsteps in accusing China of everythingBy Wang Shuo (Xinhua) 21:42, March 15, 2023The British government on Monday released its Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world. Branding China as ""an epoch-defining challenge"" to international order, the report again peddled the ""China threat"" narrative, meddling in China´s internal affairs, and smearing China on issues related to the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.The reasons for Britain´s continued rise in hostility toward China are manifold, most notably its attempt to divert public attention from its inability to solve its own internal problems.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has hit Europe hard and Britain has borne the brunt of it, facing a harsher situation than other European countries.As one of the worst-performing economies among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries last year and the only country in the Group of Seven to fail to return to pre-epidemic levels, Britain is at high risk of falling into another round of economic recession this year, with an eye-catching double-digit inflation so far.The stalled economy has exacerbated social problems. Protests and strikes have become commonplace in Britain today. The already fragmented society was torn apart. Suffering from constant political strife and the disconnect between the elite circle and ordinary Britons, Britain is swallowing the bitter fruit of Brexit.The Conservative government´s fast turnover of new prime ministers has shattered its credibility and reduced its support rate to less than 30 percent.Under such circumstances, it is very difficult for the Conservative government to admit the political system has gone wrong, nor can it profess that Brexit has been a mistake, let alone publicly acknowledge its own incompetence.Therefore, Britain finds it much easier to attribute its failure to external factors, following its ally, the United States by ascribing everything to the so-called ""China threat.""The second reason is that the British government´s commitment to achieve a ""Global Britain"" has gradually proved to be an illusion.After exiting the European Union, the largest single market, and screwing up relations with both Russia and China, Britain, which has little credibility in developing countries, seems to have no other option rather than to ride on U.S. coattails.In Washington´s eyes, however, the value of Britain has dramatically declined in the wake of Brexit. The United States has so far paid little attention to the bilateral free trade agreement highly anticipated by Britain.To curry favor with Washington, Britain has even had to do some ""dirty work"" for the United States. That´s the reason why Britain jumps higher than others on China-related issues.The good old days of the British Empire has gone. A senior U.S. general has claimed that the British Army is no longer regarded as a top-level fighting force, while British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace admitted that the British Army is ""hollowed out and underfunded.""Noting that ""Britain´s armed forces are crippled by deficiencies and shrinkages,"" Max Hastings, a British journalist and military historian, said that unless a British government makes service seem more attractive and valued, the army´s combat units will remain ""hollowed out.""All these suggest that Britain´s hard power is far less than it self-proclaimed.Moreover, quite a number of Britain´s behaviors are by no means in the moral high ground as it positioned itself to be. Just remember how many geopolitical conflicts whose seeds the British once sowed across the world. And that led us to ask the question: does Britain truly care about Ukraine or its people when it follows Washington´s footstep to prompt the world to act tough on Russia.Likewise, Britain´s meddling in the Taiwan question is in no way its genuine concern for regional peace and stability.These are, after all, stories of self-hypnosis. The more Britain indulges in taking the low road, the further it could deviate.Editor´s note: Wang Shuo is a professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University.The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the positions of Xinhua News Agency.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0315/c90000-10223033.html,15,3,2023,usa,pdo
Chinese envoy calls for mitigating humanitarian consequences of Ukraine crisis - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy calls for mitigating humanitarian consequences of Ukraine crisis (Xinhua) 09:55, March 20, 2023UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy to the United Nations (UN) on Friday called on relevant parties to do their utmost to mitigate the humanitarian consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.All relevant parties must also step up efforts to de-escalate the situation and cease hostilities as quickly as possible, Geng Shuang, China´s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told a Security Council open briefing on the situation in Ukraine.The international community should scale up relief for all affected people, speed up the repair and restoration of civilian infrastructure, and do its utmost to mitigate the impact of the conflict on people´s lives, Geng said, noting that China has provided multiple batches of emergency humanitarian aid to Ukraine and developing countries affected by the spillovers of the crisis.""Basic norms of international humanitarian law must be earnestly observed,"" he said. ""Under any circumstances, the protection of civilians must come first.""All parties to the conflict should stay rational and exercise maximum restraint and avoid actions that endanger the safety and security of nuclear facilities to minimize the risk of accidents, Geng added.He said China supports the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in fulfilling its safeguard functions and playing an active role in promoting the safety and security of nuclear facilities.The Chinese envoy stressed that spillovers of the conflict must be managed, urging relevant countries to stop abusing unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" to eliminate the disruption of international economic and trade cooperation caused by those measures.China hopes that the Black Sea Grain Initiative will be implemented fully and effectively in a balanced manner, and the memorandum of understanding signed between Russia and the United Nations can also be implemented, Geng said.""Diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution must be relentlessly advanced,"" he said. ""The international community must promote talks for peace with utmost urgency, create conditions for the resumption of negotiations, and facilitate the parties concerned to do so without preconditions at an early date to give peace a chance.""Facts have shown that the continuous supply of offensive weapons, resorting to bloc confrontation and political isolation are not helpful for resolving the crisis, he said.On the Ukraine issue, China always stands on the side of peace, dialogue and humanity. China has issued a paper stating its position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and will continue to work with the international community to play an active role, Geng said.The Chinese envoy reiterated that China´s position on the Ukraine issue remains unchanged.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224611.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo
"U.S. Fed aggressive rate hikes shock financial system, further restraining operations - People's Daily Online","U.S. Fed aggressive rate hikes shock financial system, further restraining operations (Xinhua) 11:28, March 17, 2023TOKYO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- As the shocking collapse of U.S. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) triggered turmoil in global financial markets, Japanese media and experts blamed the U.S. Federal Reserve´s continued aggressive interest rate hikes for the upheaval in the well-regarded lender.The Fed´s emergency shift in monetary policy could leave the U.S. financial system vulnerable, or bind itself to future policy actions, analysts warned.Continuous price drops in bonds held by SVB led to a large amount of booking losses, which might translate into real losses when the lender has to sell its bond assets due to tight liquidity.News of such losses triggered ferocious withdrawals from the bank and a final shutdown, according to Takahide Kiuchi, an economist at Nomura Research Institute.Start-ups, which SVB mainly serves, are experiencing the ebb tide in the U.S. economic cycle as they began a run on the bank due to difficulties in raising funds, said Kiuchi, also a former Bank of Japan (BOJ) board member.Kiuchi added that the aggressive rate hikes put banks like SVB to trouble and pushed the U.S. Treasury yield curve to its deepest inversion in over four decades, with two-year note yields exceeding 10-year yields, thus making the business model of SVB hard to sustain.The SVB´s collapse highlights the overall vulnerability of the U.S. banking industry, the Nikkei reported.As deposits are pulled for higher-yielding investments, many banks face huge paper losses in their bond operations, exposing them to huge potential risks, said the media outlet.Data from the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that unrealized losses, or assets which have decreased in value but have not been sold yet, of banks across the country swelled to 620 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year, which highlights the vulnerability of the U.S. financial system in dealing with sudden shocks.Kiuchi believed the fallout from SVB could spread around the world. Many banks in Europe and Japan also face large booking losses and inverted yield curves, and a string of problems could follow if trust in the financial system is damaged.SVB´s emergency shutdown has in fact led to a sharp rise in the market´s risk-averse sentiment. Money has been poured into safe assets such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and gold since last weekend. The Japanese stock market plunged for days, with the yen soaring and Japanese long-term interest rates decreasing significantly.Since last year, Japanese government bonds have suffered continuous sell-offs as interest rate spread between Japan and the United States further widened amid upward pressure on long-term interest rates and the BOJ.Following the SVB´s collapse, the price of Japanese government bonds quickly rose while the yield of 10-year government bonds fell sharply.Teppei Ino, a chief analyst at MUFG Bank, said that SVB´s shutdown brought concerns about the outlook for the U.S. economy into the mainstream, and that the U.S. dollar could depreciate further if volatility in America´s financial system continues to spread.Whether the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy is no longer the biggest concern now, said Naokazu Koshimizu, a senior strategist at Nomura Securities.According to him, investors, who worry about a domino effect on the banking system and the prospects for a U.S. economic recovery, may rush to the safety of U.S. treasuries in the near term, and U.S. interest rates may face downward pressure in the short term.Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management, said the closure of SVB exposed huge risks in the U.S. banking sector, and the Fed´s next move may be constrained.While the Fed´s stance on raising interest rates to curb inflation remains unchanged, the intensity of such hikes could be adjusted, he said, expecting the rate hike to be reduced to 0.25 percent at the March policy meeting.Yasuya Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, pointed out that given the current turmoil in the U.S. financial system, it will be difficult for the Fed to continue raising interest rates.Financial markets have been worried that the impact of the Fed´s aggressive rate hikes will eventually hit the U.S. economy hard, said Kiuchi.These concerns, now combined with the SVB collapse, will weigh on the Fed´s policy outlook and financial markets, creating a new situation for the Fed´s monetary policy, he said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0317/c90000-10223910.html,17,3,2023,usa,pdo

In 2014, it established a U.S. market research institute and recruited local technicians to design products for the North America market.""The United States is XCMG´s largest overseas market of construction machinery and we attach importance to the U.S. market,"" said Liu Quan, adding that the firm is mulling over a new plant in Atlanta, Georgia, in multiple phases with designed capacity of assembling around 2,000 to 3,000 machines each year.Liu Quan said Chinese equipment manufacturers are competitive in the U.S. market though almost all brands in the industry have presence in the market. The bottom line is to supply reliable products, timely service and spare parts as well as information as a service.The biggest strength of the XCMG now is the availability of products with a very good supply chain and the price point has been affordable to customers, said Loren Fehr, a dealer of the XCMG in Denver, Colorado.Fehr sees plenty room for growth and expansion in the construction industry with always expanding infrastructure.The expo offers a sound opportunity to crank up commitment to the U.S. market as the pandemic left an impact on operations in the last few years, said Bruce Liu.Zoomlion plans to expand its operation in the United States including building a local team and introduction of more product lines, he said.""We hope to make Zoomlion´s operations in North America a growth point with high quality and sustainable development,"" as Zoomlion has formed sound systems of logistics and parts supply in North America since 2008, said Bruce Liu.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0317/c90000-10224172.html,17,3,2023,usa,pdo

"U.S., Europe in bank turbulence, triggering fears globally - People's Daily Online","U.S., Europe in bank turbulence, triggering fears globally (Xinhua) 08:14, March 20, 2023NEW YORK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. banking turmoil starting last week from the nearly simultaneous collapse of tech-focused Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and two crypto-centric lenders Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, continued to unfold this week, with the fallout penetrating deeper into the U.S. financial system and spreading to Europe.People queue up outside the headquarters of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in Santa Clara, California, the United States, March 13, 2023. (Photo by Li Jianguo/Xinhua)BANKING JITTERSThe downfall of SVB and Signature Bank marked the second-and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history.Just days after the U.S. Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in to make sure that all deposit accounts at both failed institutions will be guaranteed, another regional lender First Republic Bank is teetering on the brink.Shares of First Republic Bank have been hit hard in recent U.S. bank tumult. Worrying that the San Francisco-based lender was also on the verge of collapse prompted a consortium of 11 large U.S. banks on Thursday to band together to inject 30 billion U.S. dollars in deposits to quell investor panic.The rescue attempt initially helped boost sentiment, but on Friday, First Republic Bank shares slumped again, sinking more than 32 percent to finish the week nearly 72 percent lower.In Europe, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse is also seeing issues after it revealed it found ""material weakness"" in its financial reporting and after its largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, said it would not provide the bank with any more financial assistance. Its shares slumped to record lows on Wednesday.Credit Suisse won a 54 billion U.S. dollars lifeline from the Swiss central bank, but its trouble seems far from over.While Credit Suisse´s problems may be distinct, the fact that a European bank is in hot water on the heels of U.S. banking distress rattled markets.The financial sector and the oil sector took the brunt of the pain for the banking debacles. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF shed 14.3 percent for the trading week ending March 17. Oil prices nosedived to their 15-month lows.This photo taken on March 13, 2023 shows the exterior view of a First Republic Bank branch in Millbrae, California, the United States. (Photo by Li Jianguo/Xinhua)FEARS OF MORE WOESThere is a concern of contagion, Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of U.S.-based asset management firm Krane Funds Advisors, told Xinhua.""You have a single bank that has very specific problems, but that´s affecting other banks,"" as bank failures challenged confidence in the financial system, he said.While certain aspects of the SVB situation were unique, the fundamental challenge faced by SVB is also faced by other banks, said UBS analysts.""Most banks invest customer deposits into mortgages, government securities, and loans held on the balance sheet. Over the past year, the fair market values of mortgages and government securities have fallen as a result of higher interest rates,"" they noted.In an attempt to prevent wider contagion, the Fed announced a new emergency loan program called the Bank Term Funding Program. Under this program, debt securities like long-duration U.S. Treasuries could be used as collateral for cash loans for up to a year, giving banks access to liquidity without having to sell securities at a loss.Despite the efforts, analysts noted that banks will still be faced with a potential duration mismatch between their securities and their liabilities, and the Fed´s program is no substitute for maintaining a robust depositor base.""Unfortunately, I have a feeling that what the government has done so far has not quite worked. I am afraid more will need to happen,"" Peter Cohan, associate professor of Management Practice at Babson College, a private business school in Massachusetts, told Xinhua.This photo taken on April 20, 2022 shows the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)Rating agency Moody´s has downgraded its outlook on the entire U.S. banking system from stable to negative, citing ""rapidly deteriorating operating environment"" in the wake of SVB collapse.At the same time, fears of a recession are growing on Wall Street. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their probability for a U.S. recession in the next 12 months to 35 percent, up from 25 percent, in response to increased uncertainty over the economic impact of bank stress.""The consequence of losing a regional player, the potential for losing more regional players, would have a very negative impact on the U.S. economy, and that therefore would also have an effect on the global economy,"" said Ahern. ""It is a global economy, and these localized events can have far wider repercussions.""In Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) said in a statement that ""the Governing Council is monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area.""ECB President Christine Lagarde stressed that the euro area banking sector is resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions.She said that the ECB´s toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed.Customers are seen inside a Signature Bank branch in New York, the United States, on March 13, 2023. (Photo by Michael Nagle/Xinhua)AGGRESSIVE FED POLICY TIGHTENING HURTSDebates around the causes and culprit of the swift meltdown of SVB, the 16th largest bank in the United States, continue.The SVB situation is a reminder that Fed hikes are having an effect, even if the economy has held up so far, said UBS analysts.""The banking turmoil seems like the latest symptom"" of the Fed´s most aggressive tightening cycle in decades, echoed Madison Faller, global investment strategist at J.P. Morgan.The Fed, after missing the early warning signs of inflation, has been raising interest rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s in an attempt to curb the hottest inflation in decades.""Rate hikes are meant to slow growth and inflation, and they leave damage along the way ... and now the banking sector is the latest to stumble,"" Faller said.Larry Benedict, CEO and founder of The Opportunistic Trader, a U.S. market research firm, told Xinhua that the collapse of SVB happened swiftly as a result of multiple points of failure, with higher rates playing a part.The bank ""felt comfortable that rates were gonna stay low for an extended period of time, which they totally misread,"" and then the Fed interest hikes ""really hurt them,"" he said.Ahern said the Fed´s rapid policy tightening is the ""macro backdrop"" that ""certainly exacerbated the situation of both of these two banks.""This photo taken on March 16, 2023 shows a building of Credit Suisse in Geneva, Switzerland. (Xinhua/Lian Yi)LOOPHOLE IN REGULATIONU.S. regulators failed to spot red flags in SVB´s investment portfolio and customer base, and the deregulation in U.S. banking that removed critical safeguards also contributed to the bank´s perishing, experts said.Benedict, who has over 30 years of experience as an investment professional, said he ""would blame it more on banking policymakers and people that are overseeing the banking sector in general, more so than the Fed.""He also warned of more fallout as bank regulators missed what was going on.""I agree with the idea that regulators should have acted more quickly on SVB. There were some clear signs that its business was deteriorating starting in November 2021 when its stock price peaked,"" said Cohan.""Once technology stocks began to fall and the Fed raised interest rates, regulators should have foreseen how it would hurt banks overly dependent on a continued flow of venture capital into startups,"" he said.Founded in 1983, SVB was expanding at a breakneck pace and pursuing wildly risky investments in the bond market. The vast majority of its deposits were uninsured by the federal government, leaving its customers exposed to a crisis.America´s Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act had required banks with more than 50 billion U.S. dollars in assets to face intensive federal supervision, but the 2018 rollback lifted the threshold to 250 billion. Many large lenders, including SVB, were thereby freed from the tough regulatory scrutiny.""I think there needs to be some more oversight, better regulation that potentially could have prevented this situation from occurring,"" said Ahern.The shutdown of SVB has driven home the problem of lax supervision of regional banks in the United States, said Andreas Dombret, former board member of the German central bank, Deutsche Bundesbank.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224372.html,20,3,2023,usa,pdo

Will SVB crash impact broader U.S. economy? - People's Daily Online,"Will SVB crash impact broader U.S. economy? (Xinhua) 13:07, March 16, 2023WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- With the crash of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the question on everyone´s mind is whether the problem will spread.U.S. media, analysts and ordinary Americans are speculating whether there will be a bank run or a major impact on the U.S. economy.Some analysts believe the SVB collapse is a warning of future troubles.Desmond Lachman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former official at the International Monetary Fund, told Xinhua that as the U.S. Federal Reserve battles inflation with high interest rates, ""we will see many other cases of debt default.""Those will ""cause tensions in the financial system in general and in the non-bank financial sector in particular,"" Lachman said.""The bottom line is that the Fed and Treasury´s action after SVB will stop a general bank run. However, it will not stop major problems from appearing in other parts of the financial system,"" Lachman said.The U.S. Treasury Department said there is no risk to the overall banking system that could spark a repeat of the 2007-2008 financial meltdown.The department took emergency action Sunday evening to guarantee the bank customers' deposits. Financial regulators also shuttered Signature Bank, another financial institution they believed could collapse.Former Director of the National Economic Council of the United States Larry Kudlow said Monday on Fox Business News: ""Look, like everyone, I am hoping the problem is contained, but as somebody who reported on two daily shows throughout the financial meltdown of 2008 to 2009, I know how difficult, indeed heartbreaking, a widespread banking meltdown can be, especially for typical families, blue-collar working folks.""""Nobody wants to see another stock market crash or a banking crash. So, like you, I hope this Silicon Valley Bank crisis is contained, but I never liked that word 'contained' because that´s what government authorities kept saying throughout 2007 and 2008 and they're saying it again now,"" said Kudlow, also a financial news broadcast personality.""They took all those actions. Will this stop the hemorrhaging?"" Kudlow said, referring to the government´s emergency action. ""I honestly don't know.""Indeed, recent days have seen a number of regional bank stocks fall sharply. ""That´s not good,"" Kudlow said.Lachman said: ""In the time of easy money, all too many loans were made to un-creditworthy borrowers at low interest rates. Now that interest rates are rising, we will soon find out who has been swimming naked.""Indeed, many tech startups have had all-too-easy access to funding and loans, despite no prospect of profits for years to come.Tech firms often operate on the premise of growth over profit. But with the Fed turning off the money spigot, times are tough for tech companies.Moreover, many tech companies' stocks have traded at dramatically inflated values, creating a bubble that many analysts said was just waiting to pop.Mark James, 41, a salesman outside Washington DC, told Xinhua he had heavily invested in the tech sector over the past five years.He knew there was a bubble but ""got greedy"" and ignored it. Now his portfolio is down nearly 50 percent.The case of SVB will probably just make tech markets worse, he said.Much of the problem lies with the Fed, experts said.""By earlier having pursued an overly easy monetary policy, the Fed created both an inflation problem and an asset-price and credit market bubble,"" Lachman said.Now that the Fed has been forced to raise interest rates aggressively to deal with inflation, ""it risks bursting the asset and credit market bubbles"" that were ""premised on the assumption that low interest rates would last forever,"" Lachman said.Before its crash, SVB was the 16th largest bank in the United States and had been in business for 40 years.The lender was a subsidiary of SVB Financial Group. In terms of deposits, it was Silicon Valley´s largest bank.The crisis began suddenly when the bank announced the sale of 21 billion U.S. dollars in securities and said it needed to raise 2.25 billion dollars to shore up clients' withdrawal and loan needs.The news caused the bank´s stock to tank and set off a ripple effect of withdrawals from venture capitalists. In one day, the bank´s stock took a 60 percent nosedive and drove a global loss in bank stocks of 80 billion dollars.The crisis is bringing back the ghosts of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which rocked markets to their core and triggered a massive global recession.Some analysts say the situation is different this time, as SVB is not nearly as large as the so-called too-big-to-fail financial institutions that tumbled back then.

Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks - People's Daily Online,"Chinese envoy calls for int'l discussion to address AUKUS-related proliferation risks (Xinhua) 12:21, March 11, 2023VIENNA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called for advancing open, transparent, inclusive and sustainable intergovernmental discussion at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address the proliferation risks posed by the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation.Li Song, China´s permanent representative to the IAEA, said at a meeting of the agency´s Board of Governors that the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration poses serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation regime, stimulates arms race, and threatens the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.In September 2021, the United States, Britain and Australia announced the AUKUS deal, under which Washington and London will assist Canberra in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. China and many other countries have repeatedly expressed concerns over the transfer of high purity uranium involved in the pact.The essence of the AUKUS cooperation is the transfer of tons of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from the United States and Britain, both nuclear-weapon states and signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to Australia, a non-nuclear-weapon state, Li said.He added such a ""textbook case"" of nuclear proliferation violates NPT´s objectives and principles, and undermines the IAEA´s existing safeguard system and the international non-proliferation regime.He urged the AUKUS countries to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset, fulfill their international obligations and contribute more to regional peace and stability.It is up to all IAEA member states to seek proper solutions through intergovernmental discussions regarding whether and how to conduct safeguards on the AUKUS nuclear submarine collaboration, as the matter concerns the interests of all the member states and the integrity and effectiveness of the NPT, he said.Stressing that China respects the right of all other member states to express their views, Li said that China firmly opposes any country trying to impose its own views on others.""The U.S., the UK and Australia, while preaching the so-called 'highest non-proliferation standards,' are labeling normal intergovernmental discussions as 'politicized' and rejecting multilateral discussions. Is this what they call the 'rules-based international order?'"" he said.Noting it is essential to keep the intergovernmental discussion going at the IAEA as the AUKUS countries are about to announce concrete plans for their nuclear submarine cooperation, Li said that only true multilateralism can effectively safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation regime.Li called on the IAEA member states to actively participate in the intergovernmental discussion process to help safeguard the global non-proliferation regime.He said he believes IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and the agency´s secretariat will play their due roles in the process and assist the member states in maintaining and advancing the process.He also urged the AUKUS countries not to settle on relevant safeguards arrangements with the IAEA secretariat or start nuclear submarine cooperation before a consensus is reached among the agency´s member states.The AUKUS countries should respond to the international community´s concerns with concrete actions, fulfill their non-proliferation obligations, and maintain candid and transparent communication with other member states on the basis of equality and mutual respect, he added.Representatives from Russia and other developing countries spoke in support of China´s position on the AUKUS issue at the IAEA board meeting. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220521.html,11,3,2023,usa,pdo
"Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases - People's Daily Online","Understanding what an open China means to the world through ""thinner"" suitcases (Xinhua) 12:07, March 11, 2023BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing ""two sessions"" in Beijing hold great significance not only for China´s own development but also for other nations interested in understanding China´s future growth trajectory and global impact.The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual sessions of China´s National People´s Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which are the country´s top legislature and national political advisory body, respectively.China´s opening-up policy remains one of the most discussed topics at the political event this year. The government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation demonstrates the steady progress and China´s impressive determination on the policy, saying that ""We remained committed to opening up wider to the world and expanded international economic and trade cooperation to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes.""As an Egyptian living in China for years, I have witnessed the country´s wider opening-up pursuit, and I believe an open China is vital to the struggling global economic recovery.STORIES BEHIND ""THINNER"" SUITCASESI have friends of different nationalities who share the same feeling that our suitcases are ""thinner"" these days when returning to China from holidays. Over a decade ago, my family would always stuff my suitcase with cheese, dates, spices and other local specialties before I returned to China.Now, however, more global products are entering the Chinese market through platforms such as the China International Import Expo (CIIE). With Arab specialties including Egyptian oranges, dates from the United Arab Emirates and essential oils from Syria easily available in Chinese supermarkets, I no longer need to carry these things all the way to China.According to the government work report, China developed new forms of foreign trade over the past five years and built 152 new integrated pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce. Major trade events such as CIIE, the China Import and Export Fair, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the China International Consumer Products Expo have delivered positive results.Furthermore, China simplified customs clearance procedures and reduced the clearance time for imports and exports by 67 percent and 92 percent, respectively, bringing about a significant reduction in related compliance costs, the work report added.Amidst the growing trend of trade protectionism and the so-called ""decoupling and severing industrial and supply chains"" by some developed countries, China´s efforts toward trade liberalization and facilitation have become increasingly crucial.With an enormous market of more than 1.4 billion people, China is the world´s largest goods trader, a major trading partner of over 140 countries and regions, and has the world´s second-largest consumer market and import market. There is no doubt that China is a key hub of the global economic cycle, benefiting the entire world with the dividends of its super-sized market.STRONG MAGNET FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT""Intensifying efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment,"" as stated in the government work report, is one of the key priorities of the Chinese government´s economic work in 2023.During my over a decade-long experience of living in China, I have seen an increasing number of international companies investing in the country. When enterprises first entered China, most of them just regarded it as the ""factory of the world."" But later many of these companies set up research and development centers here to continuously increase the added value of their industrial chains.In 2022, foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 8 percent year on year to 189.13 billion U.S. dollars, reinforcing its status as a magnet for foreign investors.Among Arab countries, Gulf countries' investment in China is particularly eye-catching. Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Kuwait National Petroleum Company and other energy giants have carried out in-depth investment cooperation with many Chinese provinces and enterprises.China and Arab countries have adhered to pursuing mutual benefits, promoted trade and investment facilitation, and multiplied the growth of mutual investment and economic and trade cooperation, according to the Saudi Arabian newspaper Alriyadh.The sovereign wealth funds of Gulf states have long been mainly invested in developed markets in Europe and the United States. In recent years, as China-Arab relations have continued to improve and their economic ties deepened, China´s market and assets are gradually favored by sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.In 2018, Abu Dhabi Global Market, an international financial center in Abu Dhabi, opened its first overseas representative office in Beijing.Ajlan &Bros Holding Group, a leading investment holding company in the Middle East and one of the largest private enterprises of Saudi Arabia in China, has been doing business in China for more than 20 years. With the increasingly close economic and trade exchanges between China and Saudi Arabia, the company has set up four investment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong since 2017.Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) has jumped onto the bandwagon of China´s green development. The company announced a carbon-neutral strategy and plans to actively expand investment cooperation in China.""We need to 'join hands' with each other instead of 'letting go' of each other´s hands. We need to 'tear down walls,' not 'erect walls.'"" I was deeply impressed by these inspiring words by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and I believe China walks its talk.A sentence in the government work report fully expresses China´s confidence in attracting more foreign investment, saying that with a vast and open market, China is sure to provide even greater business opportunities for foreign companies in China.MORE FRIENDS, MORE CHANCESThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has attracted more than three-quarters of the world´s countries and 32 international organizations.Over the past decade, Chinese companies have invested 397.9 billion yuan (about 57 billion U.S. dollars) in cooperation zones built in countries along the Belt and Road, creating 421,000 local jobs.The BRI has made significant contributions to Egypt´s modernization process and a notable example is the country´s new administrative capital.A modern city is taking shape in the desert east of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. Constructed by a Chinese company, the Central Business District (CBD) in Egypt´s new administrative capital boasts the tallest building in Africa, standing at 385.8 meters.This achievement is a testament to the growing friendship between Egypt and China. The project is nearing completion within just over four years. According to Egypt´s Al-Ahram newspaper, ""China speed"" makes Egypt´s dream come true.From material selection to the application of technologies, the project embodies the concept of green development and can help Cairo effectively deal with air pollution and other ""big city diseases.""The CBD in Egypt´s new administrative capital has become a popular spot, bustling with visitors. I would go there every time I go back to Egypt.The outcomes of high-quality BRI development are spread across Africa. I have experienced the Chinese-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway. From the station to the trains, I was struck by the modern scene around me. Passengers were enjoying the convenience and efficiency of the self-service ticket vending machines, while the crew provided excellent services.China´s high-level opening-up has been a continuous success, and the BRI has become an international public good and a platform for international cooperation, Karim Adel, head of the Cairo-based Al Adl Center for Economic and Strategic Studies, told Xinhua.China´s other initiatives, especially the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, have also won the support of many countries, Adel added.Last year, I had the privilege of participating in the translation and review work of the Arabic version of the fourth volume of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China."" With every word I read, I gained a deeper appreciation for the thoughts of the Chinese leader.In 2021, Xi said that on the road to the well-being of all humankind, no country or nation should be left behind. All countries and nations are equally entitled to development opportunities and rights to development, Xi said at the Communist Party of China and World Political Parties Summit. His words deeply touched me.There is an Arabic proverb that goes, ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together,"" just like how in China people often say ""more friends, more chances.""China is a country committed to high-level opening-up and I firmly believe that its efforts will bring more concrete opportunities to the world. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220517.html,11,3,2023,usa,pdo

During the peak season in winter, each area took turns to get power supply, including schools,"" he said.After graduating in 1993, Zhaxi Nyima was assigned to work at the Najin Hydropower Station, where he was responsible for the operation and maintenance of the generator units.""My job was to monitor the four hydroelectric turbine units. During the summer when the water flow in the Lhasa River was high, all four units would operate. But when the water flow reduced in winter, only two units could operate,"" Zhaxi Nyima said. adding that not until the end of the 1990s did Lhasa city solved power shortages.In 2005, he joined the urban distribution repair team to repair power failures in residential areas.Afterward, the development of Tibet´s electric power industry entered the ""fast lane.""At the end of 2011, the Qinghai-Tibet Grid Interconnection Project with a total investment of 16.286 billion yuan ($2.34 billion ) was put into operation; On November 20, 2014, the Sichuan-Tibet Power Grid Interconnection Project, which connected the Qamdo power grid in Tibet and the power grid in Sichuan, was put into operation.On November 23, 2018, the Central Tibet Power Grid Interconnection Project, which broke multiple records in the construction and operation of power grid projects, was completed and put into operation.In December 2020, the Ali-Tibet Central Power Grid Interconnection Project was officially put into operation, marking Tibet´s entry into the era of a unified power grid covering all 7 cities and 74 counties (districts) in the region.""Now that people have sufficient electricity, we are thinking about how to upgrade power supply services,"" he said.In the past, the electric wires in the old area of Lhasa were like spider webs, intertwined with various pipelines, resulting in high failure rates and difficulty in repairing.""For example, if a large courtyard in a street reported a power outage, we had to climb up the electric pole while another colleague would search for the corresponding faulty line nearby and pull it so that we could find the specific failured line, reconnect it, and restore power,"" he said.""Later, the old city area was renovated, and all pipelines were placed underground, and the spider web-like electric wires became a thing of the past,"" he added.In order to further improve the experience of residents using electricity, Zhaxi Nyima and three others were sent to other provinces by their company in 2016 to learn about live-line work and emergency repairs. In 2017, the Live-Line Operation and Maintenance Team was officially established in Lhasa City Power Supply Service Center.""Now, for some faults, we can quietly fix them during live-line work, without power outages, and the people are actually unaware of the process,"" said Zhaxi Nyima. He added that this is a kind of progress, indicating that the electricity-using experience of the Tibetan people is improving.According to official information released by the Tibet Autonomous Region in October 2022, the cumulative investment in the construction of the Tibet power grid reached nearly 70 billion yuan in the past decade, exceeding the total investment in power grid construction over the past 60 years.The State Grid Tibet Electric Power Co., Ltd. has reported that the electricity consumption in Tibet has maintained a double-digit growth rate for several years, increasing from 2.77 billion kilowatt-hours in 2012 to 11.86 billion kilowatt-hours in 2022.""I have witnessed the rapid development of the Tibet power industry,"" Zhaxi Nyima said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0309/c90000-10219139.html,09,3,2023,usa,pdo

He decided to make it a Chinese restaurant while writing.""Chinese food is popular and trendy in Thailand, so I think a Chinese restaurant (as the background) could be interesting for my story,"" Kongka said.Kongka´s novel won a gold award in the WebNovel Spirity Awards (WSA) 2022, a global online novel writing competition organized by WebNovel, a reading portal owned by China Literature Limited (CLL).First held in 2018 and aimed at English-language writers, the annual competition was opened to writers of Indonesian and Thai language for the first time in 2022. More than 90,000 novels were submitted worldwide last year, and three participants from Thailand, India and Pakistan respectively won the gold awards.At the award ceremony hosted here on Friday, more than 20 online writers from various countries and regions such as Germany, Canada, Indonesia and Thailand, and several other guests with professional backgrounds in culture and art discussed the development of online literature in China as well as globally.Online literature has offered a burgeoning approach for cultural exchanges and served as an effective way for China to tell its story of the past and the present to the world. In 2021, more than 10,000 Chinese online literary works entered overseas markets, with a market size totaling more than 3 billion yuan (about 434 million U.S. dollars), according to a blue book on Chinese online literature published by the China Writers Association.A report released by CLL at the ceremony showed that by the end of 2022, around 2,900 Chinese online literary works had been translated and published on Webnovel, attracting around 170 million readers from more than 200 countries and regions worldwide, of whom 75 percent were from Generation Z.""I knew China by watching TV series such as Bao Qingtian (Justice Bao) when I was a kid,"" said Pippo, a senior manager at OokbeeU, a Thai reading portal partnering with Webnovel, at the ceremony.Online literature has provided a new lens for people in Thailand to view China these days, especially for younger generations, as it was estimated that nearly 10 percent of the Thai population had the habit of reading novels on Ookbee, Pippo said.According to the report by CLL, among the online discussions by overseas readers on Webnovel last year, China-related words were found to be mentioned more than 150,000 times. Things like food, martial arts, tea arts, giant panda, and cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macao and Hangzhou were among the most mentioned.In September last year, 16 Chinese online novels entered a collection in the British Library, covering themes of science fiction, history, reality and fantasy, the report also said.Apart from facilitating the spreading of Chinese stories to the world, practitioners in China´s online literature industry have also contributed to promoting the global industry, as demonstrated in the report, with the total population of overseas online writers on Webnovel growing by 130 percent from 2018 to 2022. The top five countries with the largest number of writers on the platform were the United States, India, Philippines, Indonesia and Britain, in that order.According to Zhao Bipeng, the director of overseas business at CLL, China had a relatively mature industry chain for online literature, with numerous popular online novels having already been adapted into movies, TV series and video games, among others.It was important now for Chinese practitioners to develop the intellectual property of overseas online literary works with partners abroad, Zhao said.Since 2018, around 40 percent of the award-winning works of WSA had been transformed into various types of multimedia platforms, such as TV series, radio plays and cartoons. A new career development plan for overseas online writers was announced at the ceremony by CLL, aiming at tapping into the potential for adaptation of their works.For Kongka, whose three novels had already been adapted for the screen in Thailand, it had been a pity to miss a cooperation opportunity with a Chinese production company several years ago. But now, he was optimistic about his career prospect in China, and also hoped to draw new inspiration from China´s expansive and deep-rooted culture.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0313/c90000-10221439.html,13,3,2023,usa,pdo

UN envoy calls for sustainable political settlement of Yemen crisis - People's Daily Online,"UN envoy calls for sustainable political settlement of Yemen crisis (Xinhua) 08:44, March 16, 2023The UN Security Council holds a meeting on Yemen at the UN headquarters in New York, on March 15, 2023. UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg on Wednesday called for efforts toward a nationwide cease-fire and a sustainable political settlement of the conflict. (Manuel Elias/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua)UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg on Wednesday called for efforts toward a nationwide cease-fire and a sustainable political settlement of the conflict.The overall military situation in Yemen continues to be relatively stable. Since a truce came into effect on April 2, 2022, Yemeni men and women have experienced almost a year of lower levels of violence, but ""this is fragile,"" said Grundberg.In a briefing to the Security Council, he expressed concerns about the uptick in the number and the intensity of clashes in several front-line areas, particularly the fronts in Marib and Taiz. ""I call on the parties to exercise maximum restraint during this critical time, including refraining from escalatory public rhetoric, to avoid destabilizing the situation.""In addition to the relative calm, elements of the truce continue to be implemented despite the fact that the truce has not been renewed lately. Thanks to the valuable support of Jordan, commercial flights continue to operate three times a week between Sanaa and Amman. Fuel ships continue to enter Hodeidah ports, along with other commodities, he noted.Yet, these gains are also fragile. And daily life remains a struggle for most Yemenis, he warned.The economic situation continues to be dire with the sadly familiar pattern of tit-for-tat economic retaliations, rather than cooperation. New restrictions hinder the freedom of movement of civilians, particularly women, and impede commercial traffic between different parts of the country. Yemenis' access to basic services remains limited, said Grundberg.""This underscores what I have stated almost one year ago: The truce can only be a stepping stone. We urgently need to build on what was achieved by the truce and work toward a nationwide cease-fire and an inclusive political settlement to end the conflict in Yemen.""Intense diplomatic efforts are ongoing at different levels to bring the conflict in Yemen to an end, he said.""We are currently witnessing renewed regional diplomatic momentum, as well as a step change in the scope and depth of the discussions. I welcome the continued efforts of regional member states, in particular, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman and ask the parties to seize the opportunities created by the regional momentum.""Grundberg also called on all sides to maintain a conducive environment for discussions and to allow the time and space needed for the discussions to bear fruit, warning that impatience at this juncture risks a return to a cycle of violence and risks unraveling what has been achieved so far.Short-term solutions and a piecemeal approach can only bring partial relief. A cease-fire and a sustainable political settlement can only be achieved through a more comprehensive approach, he said. ""The parties, as well as regional states, are clear that any understanding reached as part of the ongoing discussions must be translated into an intra-Yemeni agreement under UN auspices. A resumption of a political process is a central element in this regard and remains at the core of my mandate.""The political process must take into account the complexities of the conflict. It will be a difficult process that requires strong planning and a vision, backed by the commitment of the parties, he said.A political process that addresses the concerns and aspirations of the Yemeni people must be Yemeni-owned and inclusive. It must include the voices of a wide range of Yemeni stakeholders, including youth, civil society, and women, he added.Grundberg hailed the Chinese-brokered agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the restoration of diplomatic relations, saying the deal will have a positive impact on Yemen.""Allow me to also take this opportunity to welcome the recent agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran to resume diplomatic ties, which was facilitated by the People´s Republic of China. This dialogue and good neighborly relations are important for the region and for Yemen,"" he said.The parties must seize the opportunity presented by this regional and international momentum to take decisive steps toward a more peaceful future. This requires patience and a long-term perspective. And this requires courage and leadership. Much has been achieved over the past year and now is the time to take the next steps, he said.Yemen has been mired in a civil war since late 2014 when the Iran-backed Houthi militia stormed several northern cities and forced the Saudi-backed Yemeni government out of the capital Sanaa. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in the Yemeni conflict in 2015 to support the Yemeni government.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0316/c90000-10223115.html,16,3,2023,usa,pdo

They have lost nearly 40 percent of their value since March 3.ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Banking giant Credit Suisse lost nearly a fourth of its value Wednesday, amid the growing fallout from the collapse of two regional banks in the United States.Wednesday marked the second time in three trading sessions since the collapse of California´s Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the subsequent failure of Signature Bank from New York, that European financial stocks were severely battered.Nevertheless, the dramatic impact on Credit Suisse in trading Wednesday was largely unexpected, since the institution is so large.According to 2022 data from Insider Intelligence, Credit Suisse was the second-largest bank in Switzerland and the 17th-largest in Europe, with an estimated 730 billion euros (772 billion U.S. dollars) in assets under control.The Swiss institution saw its share price plummet by 24 percent in trading Wednesday, ending the day at 1.7 Swiss francs in heavy trading. Earlier in the session the shares were down by more than 30 percent.Wednesday´s fall was the tenth consecutive losing session for the company´s shares. They have lost nearly 40 percent of their value since March 3, when shares traded at 2.78 Swiss francs.The latest developments have also increased volatility for the Swiss franc compared to the euro, the U.S. dollar, and other leading currencies.The euro and U.S. dollar banknotes are pictured in Madrid, Spain, Aug. 23, 2022. (Xinhua/Meng Dingbo)Stock exchanges across Europe were also impacted by Wednesday´s losses.The DAX blue-chip index on Germany´s Frankfurt Stock Exchange fell by 3.3 percent; in Paris, the CAC-40 index fell by 3.6 percent; shares slipped 4.6 percent in Milan; in Madrid they were down by 4.3 percent; and in Amsterdam by 2.9 percent.In most cases, financial sector stocks led the retreat as investors worried about further impacts on banking institutions.The Credit Suisse sell-off was reportedly triggered by a weaker-than-expected annual financial statement, followed by the announcement that a leading shareholder -- the Saudi National Bank -- would not provide new financial support through the acquisition of more shares.The Swiss National Bank said late Wednesday that it would provide Credit Suisse with cash if required to keep it afloat, although officials said the bank was not at risk of collapse.Meanwhile, the European Central Bank told other major European lenders to monitor their exposure to Credit Suisse shares of bonds.European banks have been under pressure over the last 12 months, with inflation rates soaring amid energy supply and trade issues tied to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Rising prices have squeezed profits by pushing bond yields higher. (1 Swiss franc = 1.07 U.S. dollar)A tram runs past the Euro sculpture in Frankfurt, Germany, on July 12, 2022.

Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses - People's Daily Online,"Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses (Xinhua) 13:39, February 05, 2023LONDON, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat to global public health, the World Health Organization (WHO) last month calls for the momentum for vaccination to be maintained to better cover high-priority groups.The vaccine uptake in low- and middle-income countries is still insufficient, which became a concern about the ongoing risk, according to the WHO.The world has been struggling to tackle the problem of unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between rich and lower-income countries. Yet, years after the outbreak of the pandemic, promises made by many rich countries have yet to be delivered.""No one is safe until everyone is safe,"" said Seth Berkley, CEO of the global vaccine alliance Gavi.EMPTY PROMISESAccording to figures from Our World in Data, as early as two years ago, developed countries had already acquired enough doses to vaccinate their population more than one shot for each. But even now, many Western developed countries have not yet fulfilled their promises to deliver vaccines to low-income countries.There are currently nearly 400 million doses of vaccines announced by the United States but not yet donated, according to the data. For the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the number is 41 million and 6.2 million.Commenting on the low vaccination rates in low-income countries, Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, told Xinhua in an earlier interview that ""the delay in vaccines getting to them has really been intolerable.""Last month at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland, Hatchett urged countries and manufacturers to prioritize vaccine supply to the global program COVAX.VACCINES DESTROYEDAccording to a report by qz.com last October, Canada destroyed nearly 14 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses in early 2022. Switzerland was also reported to destroy more than 14 million doses of vaccines, which was more than four times the doses it donated to low-income countries.What also worsened the global accessibility of vaccines is that some low-income countries had to turn down the offering of vaccine doses that were due to expire soon, or had to destroy such doses.In May 2021, Malawi destroyed nearly 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, which arrived in the country at the end of March but would expire on April 13.In an article published in the Sunday Mirror newspaper in 2021, WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing Gordon Brown said the West´s stockpile of COVID-19 vaccine is growing by the day but many poorer parts of the world are missing out.""We must act now,"" said the former British prime minister.IMMUNITY GAPThe obvious gap between immunity in rich and poorer countries has drawn the attention of many experts. Many have warned that the longer the unequal vaccine distribution exists, the wider COVID-19 spreads, and new variants are more likely to emerge.Extremely unequal vaccine distribution has typified the availability of vaccines across countries, said a study published in August 2022 in the UK journal Communications Medicine. ""In an unequal world with open economies, pandemics do not stop at national borders,"" it stressed.Since about 85 percent of the global population resides in low- and middle-income countries, most of humanity remains exposed to continued outbreaks, the study said, adding that this situation increases the risk that further virus variants will emerge, possibly undermining the efficacy of existing vaccines.Most people in the world´s poorest countries might not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until at least mid-2023, it said.""We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world´s population, not just the wealthy parts,"" said Berkley.As long as large portions of the world´s population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged, he said. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0205/c90000-10203404.html,05,2,2023,uk,pdo

In the eurozone, it reached 10 percent in November, and the UK´s consumer price index (CPI) rose by 10.7 percent in the same month, both well above the official target of 2 percent.High prices in most traditional goods segments, five successive quarters of real income decline, and depressed consumer confidence all suggest that Christmas sales will be disappointing in the eurozone, commented Tomas Dvorak, a senior economist at the economic advisory firm Oxford Economics.""Given the downbeat sentiment and the cost-of-living crisis, we doubt consumers will spend much of their remaining excess savings on discretionary items,"" he said.Across Europe, consumer sentiment remains mooted. Leonida, a shopper in Ljubljana, Slovenia, told Xinhua that she had narrowed down her Christmas gift list. In Bratislava, Slovakia, Beata had to buy fewer presents than in previous years, and the same applied to winter vacations.A vendor shows a baguette at a Christmas market in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 22, 2022.

In the eurozone, consumers are unlikely to splurge during the Christmas sales and are much more likely to get thrifty, and retailers' assessment of current and expected business conditions heading into the festive season has been bleak, according to Dvorak.""We are expecting the impact of high inflation on consumption to deepen at least during the beginning of next year although we also expect the fall in real wages to soften,"" Lubomir Korsnak, chief economist at the UniCredit Bank in Bratislava, Slovakia, commented.People walk past a promotional sign in Manchester, Britain, Dec. 13, 2022.

"Culture, jobs lure graduates back to China - People's Daily Online","Culture, jobs lure graduates back to ChinaBy Cheng Si (China Daily) 13:40, February 15, 2023People look for jobs at a career fair in Huai'an, Jiangsu province, on Jan 14, 2023. More than 2,000 vacancies involving accounting, marketing and logistics were offered by local firms. (ZHANG ZHAOJIU/FOR CHINA DAILY)Returning students favor lifestyle at home, upbeat on economy, survey saysChinese students who have graduated overseas have shown a greater willingness to return and work in the Chinese mainland because of more convenient living circumstances and identification with the culture, according to a new report. The optimization of COVID-19 control policies has also improved the prospects of a promising career at home, said the report by recruitment portal Zhaopin.The number of Chinese students who have graduated overseas wanting to land jobs in China saw a continuous increase from the start of the epidemic in early 2020, and reached a high in 2022.In 2021, about 1.05 million of these graduates returned to the mainland for work, almost a twofold rise from 2020 when 580,300 returned to seek employment, according to the Ministry of Education.Zhaopin conducted a survey of graduates who had returned, and found about 58 percent decided to come back to China because they preferred the convenient living environment, while 40 percent said it was because they identified with the culture.Also, the optimized COVID-19 control policies have given Chinese students graduating overseas greater confidence in the nation´s economic development in the near future, and strengthened their belief there are more job opportunities on the mainland.There has been greater demand for overseas graduate returnees after the nation optimized the COVID control policies. From Jan 30 to Feb 3, the first week after the Spring Festival holiday, Zhaopin vacancies that prioritized overseas returnees increased by 11 percent from the previous week.The vacancies gave priority to overseas returnees in sectors such as education, consultancy services and e-commerce, according to Zhaopin.Increases in recruitment salaries are also playing a big role in attracting overseas returnees. Vacancies prioritizing overseas returnees offered an average recruitment salary of 14,680 yuan ($2,151) per month in 2022, a 7 percent rise from the previous year, the report said.""I'm considering going back to China for work, mostly because I am more optimistic about China´s economy in the next three or five years,"" said Li Ying, a 25-year-old postgraduate student in the United Kingdom. ""And the culture and interpersonal relationships are also important elements. I get nostalgic sometimes, although I have friends here.""Li said that she has plans for a teaching career or working in a job with flexible hours.She said she might take a gap year and do flexible jobs and find the sector she is really interested in. ""I haven't decided about my future career yet, but I will go back to China for a job for sure.""To attract more Chinese graduates from overseas, governments at all levels have made efforts to introduce supportive policies in recent years.Hongkou district in Shanghai, for example, launched a housing policy for overseas graduate returnees in 2021. Under the policy, returning Chinese students can enjoy a six-month rental allowance within two years of gaining an overseas postgraduate degree. The rental allowance ranges from 1,500 yuan to 3,000 yuan a month.Zhu Jiaying, a member of the Hainan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, has proposed Hainan build a talent pool of overseas returnees through supportive policies and allowances.She suggested the province to first develop a detailed strategy to attract overseas students and give them preferential tax treatment.Zhaopin, the recruitment portal, said that the recovery of the nation´s economy after the optimization of the COVID policy will bring more job opportunities to overseas returnees this year. Returnee graduates will have a better chance of landing a job at home because of their international outlook and the availability of more channels providing employment information.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0215/c90000-10208029.html,15,2,2023,uk,pdo
"Dollar as U.S. currency, now is problem of world - People's Daily Online","Dollar as U.S. currency, now is problem of world (Xinhua) 08:13, November 08, 2022Photo taken on March 23, 2020 shows a U.S. dollar banknote in Washington D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)BEIJING, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. central bank raised the benchmark lending rate by 0.75 percentage point last week, the fourth increase of that size and the sixth hike this year, bringing its key rate into a range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent, the highest in 15 years.The Federal Reserve claimed such hikes necessary to ease record-high inflation. Still, before the previous aggressive currency policies show results at home, they have already wreaked havoc globally, given the dollar´s dominance in the international monetary and trade system.Following the U.S. interest rate hikes, many countries have suffered the devaluation of their currencies, capital outflows, rising debt service costs and intensified imported inflation. Some have even fallen into a currency or debt crisis.Once again, the words of former U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally in 1971 ring true: ""The dollar is our currency, but it´s your problem.""After overcoming waves of instability and the uncertainty of self-serving U.S. monetary policy adjustments over the past decades, more and more countries are sobering up to the devastating reality of dollar hegemony.Photo taken on June 22, 2022 shows the U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)DOLLAR DOMINANCEThe term ""exorbitant privilege"" was coined in 1965 by then French Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing to bemoan the U.S. practices of using the dollar´s dominance for self-interest.The international monetary system featuring a dominant U.S. dollar was established after the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement. Since then Washington launched wars and leveled sanctions against any challenger to enforce the dollar´s dominance.In the 1980s, when a fast-growing Japan sought a higher international status for the yen, the United States imposed the Plaza Accord. It caused the yen to appreciate dramatically relative to the dollar, paving the way for Japan´s ""Lost Decade"" of sluggish growth and deflation.In January 1999, when the euro was officially issued, it was 1 euro to 1.8 dollars. Two months later, the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization conducted air strikes against the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without the UN´s nod, starting the Kosovo War. Ensuing chaos triggered a capital outflow from Europe and resulted in rapid depreciation of the euro.Ellen Brown, founder of the Public Banking Institute, once wrote in an op-ed that the U.S. army attacked Iraq and Libya because they decided to cut the use of the dollar in oil trade settlement or even totally ditch the currency, which was viewed as a challenge to the petrodollar system.History has repeated itself with devastating results for those who challenge the dollar´s dominance. There seems to be an unwritten rule that the U.S. won't allow any threat to its ""exorbitant privilege.""U.S. dollar banknotes, coins and an image of White House are arranged for a photograph in Washington D.C., the United States, on Aug. 20, 2019. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)EXPLOITING OTHERSWith a U.S. dollar-centric system established after World War II, Washington has taken advantage of the dollar´s dominance to export domestic financial crises, reap world wealth and destroy the financial stability or welfare of other countries. Seigniorage, treasuries and manipulation of monetary policies are tricks the United States employs to make profits.Take seigniorage for example. The cost of minting a 100-dollar note is less than 20 cents, but other countries must pay 100 dollars worth of products or services for that paper bill. According to McKinsey data, about half of U.S. currency circulates outside the country, a huge source of annual revenue for the Fed.Another privilege allows the United States to run an external deficit, importing more than it exports and consuming more than it produces year after year without becoming more indebted to the rest of the world.On Oct. 3, the U.S. national debt surpassed 31 trillion dollars for the first time amid higher interest rates, bringing the ratio of U.S. federal debt to GDP up to roughly 126 percent. Though experts warned time and time again that such high debt is a time bomb risking a fiscal crisis and that a U.S. default would very likely lead to a global financial meltdown, it didn't seem to bother successive U.S. governments.With the dollar as the world´s leading reserve currency, the United States can profit from the Fed´s sudden reversal of its monetary strategy from a years-long ""quantitative easing (QE)"" policy to a tighter one.While the QE policy increases the supply of dollars worldwide, the ensuing lower interest rate actually encourages speculative activities in the stock market that can cause asset bubbles, adding value to U.S. assets. While Fed policy turns tighter, those U.S. assets with increased value return to America, leaving other countries with depreciated currencies and bad assets.""The fact many states accept the dollar in order to make up for the deficits of the American balance of payments has enabled the United States to be indebted to foreign countries free of charge. Indeed, what they owe those countries, they pay in dollars that they themselves can issue as they wish,"" former French President General Charles de Gaulle told journalists in 1965.An electronic display shows a real-time exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar in Tokyo, Japan, Oct. 20, 2022. (Xinhua/Zhang Xiaoyu)CURRENCY WEAPONWith the U.S. dollar as a weapon, the United States switches between currency inflation and tightening to create ""controllable turbulence"" in the financial and economic sectors, resulting in business opportunities for U.S. industry.From the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s to the 1997 financial crisis in Asia and the international financial crisis in 2008, the U.S. dollar was at play. Yet every time, the United States got away unscathed or even managed to make a profit.The United States printed nearly half the amount of currency printed in the past 200-plus years in past just one year and a half, allowing inflation to rise and economic bubbles to spill over. And the six aggressive interest rate hikes announced by the Fed this year dealt another blow to international financial markets and obstructed a weak global economic recovery.In October, Japan´s finance ministry had to spend a record 42.8 billion dollars on currency intervention to prop up the yen after it dropped below the psychologically important 150 level versus the U.S. dollar, a record low since 1990.These hikes could add pressure to capital outflows in emerging markets, push up imported inflation, increase debt vulnerabilities and reduce policy space, Malhar Nabar, division chief at the IMF´s Research Department, told Xinhua.In July, the International Monetary Fund estimated that nearly 30 percent of emerging and 60 percent of low-income countries are already in or nearing debt distress.A PRIVILEGE ON THE WANEUnder decades of U.S. financial hegemony featuring the dollar´s dominance, frustration is growing worldwide.Last month, Saudi Arabia, a flag-ship oil export country and a pillar supporter of the petrodollar system, announced a cut in its oil output, sparking fury in Washington, which had asked the oil producer to do otherwise.U.S. President Joe Biden said he would review the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia and there would be unspecified ""consequences"" for the kingdom.Andrei Kostin, president and chairman of the Management Board of Russian bank VTB, said that Washington´s ""weaponization"" of financial instruments has inevitably undermined trust in the U.S. dollar as the main reserve currency and means of payment, prompting a weighty argument in favor of broader use of other currencies.A problem with the current international financial system is a dominant dollar that ""doesn't support any other currency to come up, even Euro or Yen,"" Mohammed Saqib, secretary-general of the India-China Economic and Cultural Council, told Xinhua.He said more countries would take a chance trading outside the dollar.According to IMF data, the dollar´s share of global foreign exchange reserves diminished below 59 percent in the final quarter of last year, extending a two-decade decline.In a blog post in June assessing the composition of official foreign exchange reserves, the IMF said, ""central banks aren't holding the greenback in their reserves to the extent that they once did.""Fed up with a bullying dollar-centric system, Russia developed its financial transfer system and started trading in the rouble. The Indian central bank has introduced rupee payments with trade partners. The Bank of Israel has added the currencies of Canada, Australia, Japan and China to its foreign exchange reserves, diluting the ratio of dollars and euros.The dollar´s decades-long dominance has placed America in a strong position to dictate the terms of trade and finance for the past 70 years. Still, its dominance has been waning gradually, said London-based economist Michael Roberts.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1108/c90000-10168299.html,08,11,2022,uk,pdo

China a sunny spot amid global dark clouds - People's Daily Online,"China a sunny spot amid global dark cloudsBy Andrew K.P. Leung (China Daily) 16:19, January 13, 2023As 2023 begins, the world remains highly uncertain and fragile, with Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, saying she expects one-third of the world to be in recession.Energy and food inflationary repercussions because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict remain rampant. Cassandras are having a field day on China´s perceived doom and gloom, due to its decision to end the ""dynamic clearing"" pandemic prevention and control policy marked by increasing Omicron infections. Diplomatic rhetoric notwithstanding, there is no let up in the United States' anti-China semiconductor stranglehold, nor is there any easing of its no-holds-barred geopolitical encirclement.False perception of doom and gloomAs a matter of fact, Western media reports are full of images of stretched hospital wards, overflowing mortuaries and barren pharmacy shelves, a picture of panic and pandemonium.According to Nature, a prestigious science journal, 1 million people could die in China from the sudden surge in infections, barring re-imposition of preventive restrictions. Fears have arisen about the emergence of a new variant of the novel coronavirus or subvariants of the Omicron variant. China is sharing the latest data with the World Health Organization, and while welcoming Chinese tourists, many countries are requiring internationally-recognized non-infection proof before entry.So why do I think China is likely to be a comparatively sunny spot?First, much misunderstood and misrepresented, the strict prevention and control policy did not mandate zero cases in all circumstances. It was used as a strategy to ensure earliest possible detection, isolation, treatment and cure. As a result, it greatly minimized deaths and prevented contagion from province to province.According to Johns Hopkins University´s analysis updated on Dec 31, 2022, China´s COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 people stands at 1.2, compared with 331.65 for the US, 45.05 for Japan, and 38.46 for India.It´s very saddening that some senior citizens may die in the latest wave of infections, but it should be noted that there will be no significant change in China´s extremely low mortality rate compared with the overall international rate.In a way, China is a ""victim"" of its own success in shielding the vast majority of its population from the pandemic. As a consequence, ""herd immunity"" remains relatively low. While 90 percent of the population has received the first vaccination dose, only 76.6 percent of those aged 80 and above have got at least one dose, and only 40 percent have received a booster dose.Beijing is now scrambling to vaccinate up to 90 percent of those aged 80 or above by the end of January. It is also building a database of people living with chronic diseases to maximise the rate of successful outcomes.As the massive Chinese Lunar New Year migration starts (people returning home for Spring Festival family reunion), Beijing has asked prefecture and township officials to urgently fortify pandemic defenses, including better manning clinics, stocking medicines, medical equipment, and free ""medicine kits"", raising the public´s medical awareness, and using official information to counter rumours.As for some barren pharmacy shelves in some cities, they largely reflected public hysteria due to the sudden rise in infections among family members, friends and colleagues. There is a mad rush to stock up on fever medicines such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, prompting the authorities to take measures to increase the production of these two drugs by four times in a month to 202 million tablets and 190 million tablets respectively. But it should be noted that many cities have already withstood the infection peak and gradually returned to normal.With expert input, China, the same as other countries, has realized that the COVID-19 pandemic has become an endemic disease with a much lower mortality rate, albeit it is much more contagious now. In fact, most infected people get well after a week or so. As such, initial paranoia is slowly giving way to good-humoured acceptance of widespread but mild infections.Right time to pursue second centenary goalWith the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China already three months behind us, it´s time to recharge our batteries and make efforts to realize China´s centenary goal of becoming a modern socialist nation including achieving ""common prosperity"" by mid-century.Part and parcel of the trajectory is a surging middle-income group — expected to be 800 million strong by 2035 — a vast number of which came out in droves across China to celebrate the dawning of the New Year. With more than 400 million middle-income consumers at present, China is already the world´s second-largest consumer market. And since China is continuing to further open up while pivoting toward domestic consumption, it is set to become the world´s largest consumer market in the coming years.Many Chinese consumers are well-off enough to afford overseas travel, and the government has opened the borders to allow two-way flow of Chinese travellers, foreign visitors and university students.According to an August 2021 report by Georgetown University´s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology, Chinese universities are expected to produce more than 7.7 million STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates annually by 2025. That number will outstrip that of the US by more than three to one if international students are excluded. In this regard, China´s success in building its own Tiangong space station speaks volumes about its scientific and technological capabilities.Besides, despite US semiconductor restrictions, China is leapfrogging into next-generation photonic and quantum chips. Along with a head start in various aspects of 5G technology, big data and the internet of things, China is staying ahead of the game in harnessing the ""Fourth and Fifth Industrial Revolutions"". And given its ubiquitous digital economy aided by robotics and automation, aging demographics are not an insurmountable challenge for China.Pivotal position in global economyUS-led efforts at decoupling notwithstanding, China remains at the heart of the global supply and value chains, especially in the world´s largest trading bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which represents one-third of global GDP and a third of the world´s population. China´s pivotal position in the world economy is further entrenched with the massive Belt and Road Initiative, with railways, bridges, highways and ports linking up the region.Even when some Chinese cities were under lockdown in October last year, some media reports, using the IMF´s earlier estimate of only 4.4 percent growth, concluded that China would contribute 30 percent to global growth in 2023. Allowing for infection surges in the first quarter or so, the Economist Intelligence Unit has revised upward its forecast for China´s real GDP growth from 4.7 percent to 5.2 percent in 2023. This is in stark contrast to the IMF chief´s forecast of global recession.However, the next couple of months are likely to be crucial because China still needs to keep a close eye on the epidemic since it took new rules on Jan 8. With Beijing´s proven track record of massive mobilization of personnel and resources, the light of hope is right in front of us as President Xi said in his televised New Year speech.The author is an international and independent China strategist and is a former director-general of social welfare and Hong Kong´s official chief representative for the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Russia, Norway and Switzerland.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0113/c90000-10195875.html,13,1,2023,uk,pdo
World awaits return of Chinese tourists - People's Daily Online,"World awaits return of Chinese touristsBy Jinith de Silva (China Daily) 15:07, February 13, 2023　　(MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY)Before the COVID-19 pandemic, China was the world´s most important source of international travelers, and Chinese tourists were the biggest overseas spenders. According to the United Nations' World Tourism Organization, Chinese tourists spent $255 billion overseas and made 166 million overseas trips in 2019.Tourism expenditure is an important criterion to determine the health of a country´s tourism industry. With a population of more than 1.4 billion, massive increase in economic power and remarkable improvements in people´s living standards, China became the most important source of outbound tourists who were also the biggest overseas spenders.During the past three years, however, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many Chinese people to forgo international travel and cut household spending. But now that the suppressed spending power is likely to be unleashed thanks to China easing the prevention and control measures, there could be a huge explosion in spending by Chinese tourists.The pace of China´s reopening is of significance to the global tourism industry. Tourism officials and professionals in many countries are looking forward to the mass return of Chinese tourists as early as possible, because they could fuel the recovery of the tourism sector worldwide and promote cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.Several Southeast Asian countries that depend, to a large extent, on tourism have kept entry rules relatively relaxed for Chinese tourists despite the recent COVID-19 outbreaks in China. They include Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. New Zealand, too, has waived testing requirements for Chinese visitors, who were the second-largest source of tourism revenue for the country before the pandemic.After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and China, the two countries took a number of steps in the political, economic, trade and cultural fields to strengthen bilateral ties. Thanks to the strong bilateral relations, cultural familiarity and reliable visa policies, a large number of Chinese tourists visit Sri Lanka every year. In fact, China is one of the top three sources of tourists for Sri Lanka, with 167,863 Chinese tourist arrivals being recorded in Sri Lanka in 2019.Tourism is the third-largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. The tourism industry of Sri Lanka, which was dealt a catastrophic blow by the pandemic, now has the opportunity to recover rapidly. And it is all set to welcome Chinese tourists, especially because the island country´s government has adopted a series of new policies to attract Chinese travelers.In order to draw more Chinese tourists, hotels in Sri Lanka have introduced Digital QR Chinese menus. Hotel experts say their intention is to make Chinese people feel welcome and provide the exquisite traveling experience for them.Sri Lanka has been ranked first among the top 24 countries to visit in 2023 by travel site Travel Triangle. According to Travel Triangle, golden beaches, wildlife-rich forests, rolling tea plantations, and mist-shrouded mountains make Sri Lanka one of the best Asian countries to visit. Also, Sri Lanka is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites.To begin with, there are the ruins of the ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura in the North Central Province, which flourished from the 5th century BC to the 10th century CE. There are also the ruins of the successor kingdom, Polonnaruwa (9th-14th century), and the incredible Sigiriya Rock fortress in the northern Matale district in Central Province.The entire city of Kandy (the seat of kings from the 16th to the 19th century) with its revered temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as are the Dambulla caves and temple dating from the 1st century BC. Galle Fort, begun by the Portuguese in 1588, too, is on UNESCO´s heritage list. The two natural landmarks on the list are the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the Central Highlands (Peak Wilderness, Horton Plains and the Knuckles Conservation Forest.)No wonder China´s Ministry of Culture and Tourism has announced that Sri Lanka will be among the countries in its outbound tourism pilot program, which started on Feb 6.Sri Lanka´s tourism revenue fell precipitously in the past three years as the country more or less closed its borders during the pandemic. But, with China ""reopening"" after three years, millions of tourists are poised to travel across the world, raising hopes of a rebound of the hospitality industry and an increase in employment in Sri Lanka. This proves the importance of China to global tourism.The resumption of outbound travel by the Chinese people, which used to be a considerable source of revenue for economies that depend heavily on tourism, will help revive the tourism sector and promote cultural exchanges at the international level.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0213/c90000-10206955.html,13,2,2023,uk,pdo
Scientists say Sunak's decision on testing travelers from China purely political move: The Guardian - People's Daily Online,"Scientists say Sunak´s decision on testing travelers from China purely political move: The Guardian (Xinhua) 09:15, January 03, 2023LONDON, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have dismissed British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak´s decision to impose COVID-19 tests on travelers from China, calling it ""a purely political manoeuvre,"" British newspaper The Guardian has reported.Scientists said testing travelers from China will ""make no difference to the rise or fall"" of the number of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom (UK), according to the report published on Saturday.UK´s chief medical officer Chris Whitty on Thursday briefed the health secretary Steve Barclay, saying that no clear evidence of significant benefits was shown from testing travelers from China, said the report.Quoting another news outlet, the Observer, the report said Barclay had discussed the issues with Sunak but the Prime Minister ""decided that it was more important for Britain to align itself with those nations -- the U.S., Japan, Italy and Spain -- that had already imposed such tests.""""I don't think it´s likely the UK will get any public health benefit from this measure,"" said Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University in the report. ""This can only have been done for political reasons.""Woolhouse added that another reason for testing was to track new COVID-19 variants, but no one in the UK seemed worried about the new variant XBB.1.5, which now accounts for about 40 percent of cases and is spreading rapidly in the U.S..""Instead, a lot of noise is being made about hypothetical variants emerging in China,"" said Woolhouse.Professor Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia also told the newspaper: ""Point-of-entry and point-of-exit screening for serious infections have been shown -- on many occasions -- to be ineffective at controlling diseases.""""This isn't going to protect the UK population because it isn't going to stop the spread. So it is hard to see what will be gained by imposing these tests,"" said Hunter.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0103/c90000-10191106.html,03,1,2023,uk,pdo
Nation can help cool soaring global inflation - People's Daily Online,"Nation can help cool soaring global inflationBy OUYANG SHIJIA (China Daily) 08:15, February 03, 2023An Indian customer shops at a toy store on Thursday at Yiwu International Trade City in Yiwu, Zhejiang province. The complex, the world´s biggest small-commodities market, reopened after closing for the Spring Festival holiday in late January. HUANG ZONGZHI/XINHUAStable prices provide room for more policy easing to shore up economyChina, with its benign inflation rate, is capable of playing a pivotal role in helping cool soaring global inflation and will continue to ensure strong economic recovery and mild price fluctuations this year, analysts and executives said.In marked contrast to major advanced economies, which have been plagued by surging inflation amid rising energy and food prices, China has seen its inflation levels remain low and stable, which, analysts said, provides space for further policy easing to shore up the world´s second-largest economy.""Over the past year, many advanced economies witnessed the biggest surge in inflation in 40 years,"" said Liu Zhicheng, director of commodity market division at the Academy of Macroeconomic Research´s market and price research institute. The academy is affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, China´s top economic regulatory body.Last year, a number of developed economies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, experienced inflationary whiplash. During the first 11 months of 2022, the inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, was 8 percent in the United States, 8.4 percent in the eurozone and 8.9 percent in the UK, sparking public complaints and protests. Some developing countries have also suffered from high inflation.Both the Bank of England, Britain´s central bank, and the European Central Bank were expected to raise interest rates on Thursday to tame high inflation, ease the cost-of-living crisis and avoid falling into recession. The US Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday.China has had a good record of keeping its overall price levels low and stable. Last year, the country´s consumer price index rose by 2 percent year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, which was well below the country´s inflation control target of around 3 percent.Notably, China´s food inflation rate was 2.8 percent and the cost of water, electricity and fuel rose a modest 3 percent in 2022, both significantly lower than in major Western economies, Liu said.He attributed soaring inflation across the globe to runaway energy and food prices amid geopolitical tensions and the massive fiscal and monetary easing measures in many Western countries.China has managed to deal with imported inflationary pressures with effective measures focused on stabilizing prices of products essential for people´s livelihood as well as bulk commodities.""China´s stable price levels are creating an environment that keeps economic performance stable, which also helps tame global inflation,"" Liu said.While warning of headwinds from imported inflationary pressures and potential fluctuations in commodity prices, Wan Jinsong, director of the NDRC´s Department of Price, said China has solid foundations as well as the confidence and capabilities to maintain overall price stability in 2023.Wan said at a recent news conference that the country has sufficient supplies of goods essential for people´s livelihood, a stable energy supply and an improved system for ensuring price and supply stability.""Compared with the dramatic inflation surges much of the world has experienced, China has continued to have low inflation due to weak domestic demand and government measures to stabilize prices and supplies,"" said Zhou Maohua, an analyst at China Everbright Bank.NBS data showed China´s CPI grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year in December, while the inflation rate in the US was 6.5 percent in the same month.Zhou estimated that China´s CPI will remain at a moderate level this year given the gradual pickup in demand and the country´s sufficient supply of daily necessities.""Unlike many other economies, China has not adopted massive policy stimulus over the past few years,"" he said. ""Given its stable inflation levels, the country has ample room and plenty of policy tools in reserves to support the economy.""Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said that his team thinks inflation is not a major concern for China in 2023, and they expect the policy stance to remain accommodative.A top government think tank forecast that China´s consumer inflation will stay mild in 2023, while cautioning that the risk of price increases beyond expectations still remains.The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Center for Forecasting Science estimates that China´s CPI will rise about 1.8 percent in 2023, while the producer price index will decline by about 0.4 percent.Gao Ruidong, chief macroeconomist at Everbright Securities, warned that the robust recovery in consumption of services may add to ""structural inflation pressures"".China is taking a more pro-growth stance, giving priority to expanding domestic demand and spurring consumption. The local governments have mapped out detailed plans in an attempt to put growth back onto the fast track.On Tuesday, the Beijing Municipal Government released a document on key tasks for 2023, urging more efforts to boost consumption, including spurring consumption in housing, new energy vehicles and elder care.There have been initial signs of recovery in consumption thanks to such policies in other provincial-level regions.In Guangdong province, Guangzhou´s Beijing Road shopping area achieved a business turnover of 345 million yuan ($51.3 million) in the weeklong Spring Festival holiday, up 19.4 percent year-on-year, official data showed.Gao said in an article published in China Finance magazine that the country will also likely see a notable rebound in consumption of services, such as transportation, catering, accommodation and entertainment, and prices for services will go up in the post-COVID period.He said the government should take more steps to keep prices stable, with a key focus on ensuring the supply of food and energy, assisting companies to stabilize employment and promoting the rebound of services industry.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0203/c90000-10202729.html,03,2,2023,uk,pdo

The walkouts are expected to take a huge economic toll.Strikes on the London Underground will go ahead on Thursday, after the government body Transport for London (TfL) and trade union representatives failed to reach an agreement. The unions had asked TfL to pause job cuts and changes to pensions.""Our members are resolute in their determination to see a just settlement to this jobs and pensions dispute,"" said Mick Lynch, general secretary at The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. ""They will continue their industrial campaign for as long as it takes.""TfL has warned that there will be ""limited or no services running"" on Thursday, and passengers should avoid traveling on the Tube.London Underground handles up to five million passengers a day, according to TfL. At peak times, there are over 540 trains running around the capital.Meanwhile, starting on Nov. 18 around 700 workers at London´s Heathrow airport will participate in three days of strike action over pay. These workers are responsible for a wide variety of roles, including ground handling, airside transport and cargo, said Unite, one of the largest trade unions in the UK.The strike will particularly affect Qatar Airways, which has scheduled an additional 10 flights a week during the World Cup, which starts on Nov. 20. Passengers returning to the United States for the Thanksgiving holiday are also set to be adversely affected, Unite said.Next, more than 70,000 university staff at 150 UK universities will strike for three days at the end of November over pay, working conditions and pensions. The strike will be ""the biggest ever to hit UK universities and could impact 2.5 million students,"" the University and College Union (UCU) said on Tuesday.UCU´s demands include a meaningful pay rise to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, after employers granted a pay rise worth just 3 percent this year. This followed over a decade of below-inflation pay rises, the union underlined.More than 300,000 members have been urged to vote for strike action in the Royal College of Nursing´s (RCN) biggest strike ballot in its 106-year history. The ballot was closed in early November, with results set to be announced at a later date.""None of us wants to take industrial action but we've been forced into this position after a decade of real-terms pay cuts. We can't stand by and watch our colleagues and patients suffer anymore,"" said RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen.Driven by rising food prices, Britain´s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 10.1 percent in September.

Private sector earnings fared slightly better, but were still only 0.9 percent higher on average in July 2022 than in July 2007.The UK has also seen a summer of walkouts by staff in sectors including public transport, container port operation and postal delivery. The walkouts have taken a huge economic toll.As well as the huge impact on day-to-day life, economists have assessed that the first wave of rail strikes alone, in June 2022, cost the UK economy nearly 100 million pounds (114 million U.S. dollars).

(Photo by Stephen Chung/Xinhua)The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January.LONDON, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- This January, three years after its departure from the European Union (EU) in 2020, Britain still suffers from division with parliament members continuing to pressure the prime minister on Brexit´s consequences during their weekly conventions.""It´s clear that Brexit and its hold over British politics remains strong,"" noted Sophie Stowers from the academic network UK in a Changing Europe. ""Britain has been split into two distinct camps: 'Leavers' and 'Remainers'.""Brexit chaos has showed no sign of stopping. The divorce has turned out to be long and unpleasant, full of quarrels and distrust, both inside Britain as well as between it and the bloc. As much evidence has showed, the British economy has suffered much, and frustration has grown over the unfulfilled promises. Worse yet, no quick solution is in sight.ECONOMIC TOLL""There´s now a reasonable consensus that the effects of Brexit on the UK economy have been negative,"" Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) told Xinhua. ""It´s more an incremental, small, bit-by-bit, drip-by-drip effect on the British economy. But it´s mainly been in one direction of being negative.""Evidence abounds that both households and businesses have been hit hard. Brexit added an average of 210 pounds (258.4 U.S. dollars) to household food bills in the EU over the two years to the end of 2021, and cost British consumers a total of 5.8 billion pounds (7.1 billion dollars) with higher food bills, research from the LSE Centre for Economic Performance showed in December 2022.A man stands at the entrance of a store in Basingstoke, Britain on Nov. 13, 2022. (Photo by Tim Ireland/Xinhua)""And since low-income households spend a greater share of their income on food than richer families, these Brexit-driven price rises had a proportionately greater impact on the poorest people,"" the study added.Companies have also felt the blow. Nearly half businesses still found Brexit challenging, while only a third could envisage opportunities materializing from Brexit, a report published by the Institute of Directors in November 2022 showed.Businesses said that they have lost clients as a result of Brexit, and that they have had to divert supply chains and relocate to the EU to keep trading, said the report, noting that EU firms are pulling out of Britain as an export market because of the barriers.""Businesses feel they are banging their heads against a brick wall as nothing has been done to help them,"" said Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""The longer the current problems go unchecked, the more EU traders go elsewhere, and the more damage is done.""Brexit has inevitably led to tax rises as well, because a slower-growing economy requires higher taxation to fund public services and benefits, said deputy director John Springford at the think tank Centre for European Reform. If Brexit had not happened, he added, most of the tax rises that the government announced in March 2022 would not have been necessary.A report published by think tank Resolution Foundation in June 2022 found that since 2019, Britain had experienced a sharp decline of 8 percentage points in trade openness, or total trade as a share of GDP. It´s estimated that labor productivity will be reduced by 1.3 percent by the end of the decade due to changes in trading rules alone.While the debate on the impact of Brexit has implied a one-off shock, adjustment will be gradual and create a lasting impact on Britain´s competitiveness and productivity over the coming decade, the report noted.BROKEN PROMISESOne of the illusory promises of Brexit was it would enable Britain to cut quick-and-easy trade deals, but this has not happened with the EU, by far its largest partner, nor with the United States, said John Kampfner from the policy institute Chatham House in a December 2022 article.Photo taken on Dec. 31, 2020 shows a general view of the Port of Dover, following the end of the Brexit Transition Period, in Dover, Britain. (Photo by Tim Ireland/Xinhua)""Considerable effort, and resource, has been expended on devising an independent trade policy. Once again, the results are limited,"" Kampfner noted. ""Much of Brexit´s Global Britain dream was based on reviving deeper relationships with the Commonwealth. Again, this is proving harder than originally envisaged.""The reality is that the vast majority of the 71 deals reached since Brexit are rollover agreements with countries that already had trade agreements with the EU, according to researcher Stephen Hunsaker at the UK in a Changing Europe in January. Even though the existing UK-Japan agreement was slightly modified, analysts cautioned that it will provide no net gain compared to the EU-Japan deal, Hunsaker added.Also, migration was quite a big deal in Brexit debates, but two years on from the end of free movement, the level of net migration certainly has not fallen, said Torsten Bell, chief executive at the Resolution Foundation.Statistics show net migration continued to add to the population in the year ending June 2022, with an estimated 504,000 more people arriving long-term to the UK than departing.""EU migration has decreased sharply, while there has been a substantial increase in non-EU migration. Combined with other factors, this has led to migration overall running at record levels,"" said a report published by UK in a Changing Europe in January.""The new system has seen increases in work visas in the health sector, and some other high-skilled service sectors, while other sectors, such as hospitality, which were previously more dependent on EU workers, are seeing labour shortages,"" it added.Regrets have been growing. The number of Leave voters who think it was wrong for Britain to vote leave the EU has been steadily increasing since 2021, hitting a record 19 percent in November 2022, YouGov data showed, identifying the top reason as ""just a general sense that things have gotten worse since Brexit.""Simon Wolfson, chief executive of the retailer Next, called for more foreign workers in Britain during a recent media interview. It is ""not the Brexit I wanted,"" said the Brexit supporter.CONTINUED CHAOSA dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol, the rules governing post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, has strained Britain´s relations with the EU, even stoking worries of a trade war. Tension grew when the British government in June 2022 introduced a bill to unilaterally change parts of the protocol, which the EU said was not acceptable.A vehicle moves past a border sign near Newry, Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, on June 14, 2022.

However, a de facto Irish Sea border was thus created between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, meaning goods transported to and from Northern Ireland are subject to border controls.This has elicited firm opposition from Northern Ireland´s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, which has demanded the removal or replacement of the protocol as a precondition for it to sit in the assembly and form a devolved government. Political chaos has continued.The British government´s approach to resolving the problems with the protocol has been counterproductive and has further undermined trust, said Hilary Benn, the Labour Member of Parliament for Leeds Central, in September 2022.""One of the most striking features of Brexit is that those who argued most strongly for it appear unwilling to take any responsibility for its consequences. Nowhere has this been demonstrated more clearly than in the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Benn noted.More recently, with efforts to heal the rifts, progress was made in Britain-EU talks. Nevertheless, gaps remained, and analysts expect a long road ahead for the two sides to settle their disputes.The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January. ""What seems clear, however, is that the relationship is far from settled. Brexit will not be 'done' for a while yet.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0201/c90000-10202028.html,01,2,2023,uk,pdo

Although facing fierce competition from domestic rivals, they will remain competitive in this huge market as long as they adjust quickly, Sang added.Zhang Xiaoyu, president for China at Arkema, a French manufacturer of specialty materials, said, ""With China further optimizing its COVID-19 control policies and vowing to make greater efforts to maintain steady foreign investment growth, we remain confident and ready to contribute to the development of local industry.""Early last month, Bostik, a subsidiary of Arkema, announced a plan to increase its investment by 400 million yuan ($58 million) in new businesses and to develop new products in Shanghai.【1】【2】【3】【4】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0106/c90000-10192623.html,06,1,2023,uk,pdo

""The UK is trying to export more goods and services to China to compensate for the loss on the EU front.""On the other hand, he added, although the geopolitical drumbeat was noticeable between the UK and China last year, the reality was that businesspeople were putting their money where their mouths were, and that was reflected clearly in the trading data.Given that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already revised China´s economic growth rate to 5.2 percent in 2023, the country´s purchasing power should increase and therefore trade between the UK and China should improve in 2023, Cheung said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0218/c90000-10209526.html,18,2,2023,uk,pdo

UK economy contracts in Q3 as recession looms - People's Daily Online,"UK economy contracts in Q3 as recession looms (Xinhua) 13:58, November 12, 2022LONDON, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom´s (UK) economy contracted by an estimated 0.2 percent in the third quarter (Q3) of this year, official figures showed on Friday. This is expected to mark the start of a long recession that could last for two years.FIRST CONTRACTION SINCE 2021Following a rise of 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the three months from July to September saw the first quarterly contraction since the start of 2021, when the country was under tight COVID-19 restrictions. The economy is still 0.4 percent below its pre-COVID-19 level, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Monthly estimates showed the gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 0.6 percent in September. GDP was affected by the bank holiday for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, when some businesses closed.""The quarterly fall was driven by manufacturing, which saw widespread declines across most industries. Services were flat overall, but consumer-facing industries fared badly, with a notable fall in retail,"" said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan.Among the six Group of Seven (G7) economies that have already reported Q3 estimates, GDP only fell in the UK. It is also the only G7 country not to have seen GDP recover fully to its pre-pandemic level, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy.""The UK economy has slipped to the back of the G7 pack again, beset by more intense headwinds from fiscal and monetary policy, and substantial long-term supply-side damage from Covid and Brexit,"" Tombs said.LONG RECESSION LOOMINGA lengthy recession is looming for the UK. The Bank of England in early November said that if interest rates were to rise as much as the market expected, the GDP will continue to fall throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024. Even without more rate hikes, the economy is still expected to be falling at the end of 2023.Many business surveys have depicted a bleak future. The S&P Global/CIPS Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index registered at 47.2 in October, and it has stayed below the neutral 50.0 no-change value since August. The GfK consumer confidence index for the UK in September hit its lowest point since records began in 1974.Monthly comparison of independent projections published by the UK Treasury in October showed an average new forecast of 3.9 percent for UK GDP growth in 2022, and 0.3-percent contraction in 2023.Should the UK slide into recession next quarter, it would be the quickest return to recession since 1975, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. The UK only came out of its last recession eight quarters ago.After the September announcement of a large-scale package of tax cuts rattled financial markets and raised severe concerns about the UK´s fiscal health, the UK government has taken a U-turn and is set to raise taxes and cut spending to offer reassurance. However, economic growth is expected to take a further blow.""I am under no illusion that there is a tough road ahead -- one which will require extremely difficult decisions to restore confidence and economic stability,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt tweeted on Friday in response to the GDP statistics.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1112/c90000-10170437.html,12,11,2022,uk,pdo

Thanks to its extremely important geographical position, the Arabian region is bound to be a buffer between China and the United States and Europe.The Arabic civilization in the Middle East, the Confucian civilization of China and the Western Christian civilization represented by Europe and the US are together called the great triangle of world civilizations.These civilizations have blended, but also collided, with each other during exchanges, while developing together as well as restricting each other. In a process lasting more than 1,000 years, 10 ethnic groups in China converted to Islam, thus adding another diverse element to the Chinese nation and civilization. This shows that members of different civilizations can live together in peace and resolve their differences through dialogue.As an important part of the developing world and the Non-Aligned Movement, Middle East countries have played (and are playing) a very important role in the development of China´s diplomacy and multilateral relations. That New China could break the Western diplomatic boycott and blockade, return to the United Nations and become an important player in the international political arena was made possible partly due to the understanding and support of the Middle East countries.In recent years, China and the Arab countries have reached many consensuses on issues such as human rights, democratization of international relations, and building a multipolar world order. When it comes to China´s core interests, no matter how many differences the Middle East countries have, the four major players — Arab countries, Turkey, Israel and Iran — have always understood China´s position and supported it, which makes the region China´s core base on the international stage.With limited resources, relatively insufficient workforce and unbalanced economic development, the region is economically complementary to China. China´s initial overseas engineering projects and labor export since the launch of reform and opening-up all positioned the Arab region as the main market. Such exchanges helped increase China´s foreign exchange earnings, made it more familiar with international rules and consolidated its diplomatic relations with other countries.The China-Arab regional trade volume has increased by nearly 80 times — from less than $3 billion in 1990 to about $300 billion in 2021 — and China has become the largest trading partner of the region.In particular, the Belt and Road Initiative has accelerated two-way economic, trade and investment activities. For example, China is helping Egypt´s industrialization and Saudi Arabia´s economic diversification, while improving the overall development level in the Middle East.Also, China is the largest importer of oil and gas from the Middle East, which holds 70 percent and 50 percent of the global oil and natural gas reserves.Since China became a net importer of oil in 1993, its energy imports have doubled every 10 years, of which 60 percent comes from the Middle East. In 2021, China´s total oil imports reached 51,298 million metric tons, with the Middle East accounting for 51.25 percent of that, with the exception of Iran, which once accounted for a high percentage of China´s energy imports but has been forced to drastically cut oil exports due to US sanctions.China has suggested ways to resolve or reduce conflicts in the Middle East. It is the only major country that has no record of colonization, or staging invasion or proxy wars in the Middle East. It has always believed that it is the people who should decide the fate of their country, and countries should settle their disputes through peaceful talks.At the beginning of the Gulf War in 1990, China worked as a mediator, trying to persuade Saddam Hussein´s government to end its occupation of Kuwait and avoid war. In 2002, China appointed its first Middle East special envoy dedicated to mediating between the Palestinians and Israelis to help resolve their disputes. In 2003 before the Iraq War, it advocated peaceful resolution, but the US, the United Kingdom and other US allies still resorted to military means. And when the Libyan crisis broke out in 2011, China accepted the decision of the League of Arab States and didn't veto Security Council Resolution 1973, and asked the Libyan government and opposition to settle their disputes through talks.But China, along with Russia, used its veto powers in the Security Council many a time when it came to the Syrian crisis, in order to thwart the West´s attempts to subvert, even overthrow, the legitimate Syrian government. Most dispensations in the Middle East, including the Syrian government and the opposition, lauded China for its efforts. China has also played the mediator´s role in the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan, something which other major powers have not done.China is strongly against extremism, violence and terrorism, but it has participated in only justified anti-terrorism operations in the Middle East, reflecting its respect for multiculturalism and the values which other civilizations hold high. It also demonstrates China´s belief in the principle that extremism and terrorism are not associated with a specific ethnic group or faith.As a matter of fact, China advocates that global cooperation to fight terrorism be based on international law and respect for the sovereignty and dignity of all countries, a position which has been welcomed by Middle East countries.In accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China is practicing major country diplomacy, playing a responsible international role, and highlighting the importance of Middle East countries' diplomacy in international relations.Still, China´s diplomacy in the Middle East is in its primary stage. It largely lags behind that of the US in comprehensive strength, and Russia in diplomatic and military capabilities. Also, its soft power and geographical position still cannot rival those of Europe, especially the UK and France. Therefore, China´s cooperation with the Arab countries still has a lot of potential to tap.The author is the dean of and a professor at the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1207/c90000-10180813.html,07,12,2022,uk,pdo
Massive strikes to hit Britain during Christmas season - People's Daily Online,"Massive strikes to hit Britain during Christmas season (Xinhua) 10:13, December 17, 2022LONDON, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) faces weeks of massive strikes during the Christmas season by transport and postal workers, nurses, and border guards.A wave of industrial action began on Tuesday, with more than 40,000 members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) walking out for 48 hours. Three more weeks of disruption are set to follow.Britain´s National Railway said due to various industrial actions, there will be a reduced train service until Jan. 8, 2023, with ""significant disruption expected across the rail network.""The Communication Workers Union (CWU) also said there would be strikes on Dec. 23 and Dec. 24, some of the busiest days for pre-Christmas deliveries.Meanwhile, the Public and Commercial Service (PCS) union has announced that Civil Service industrial action in late December will impact Border Force services. Travelers who are planning to enter the UK during the proposed strike period may face longer waiting times at border controls.Nurses have also joined the list of striking workers.""Up to 100,000 nursing staff are taking part in strikes in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, and a further day of strike action is planned for Dec. 20,"" said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).Gemma Dean, a human resources expert and lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University´s business school told Xinhua in an interview: ""The industrial situation we're seeing at the moment, with a significant increase in strikes, has been something we haven't seen in the UK for a little while.""What we're seeing right now are groups of workers going on strike or taking forms of industrial action that typically haven't done so. For example, ambulance drivers and nurses. Some of these groups have never gone on strike, so it is surprising to see that, but it may be reflective of the depth of feeling that employees have now about their pay and their terms and conditions of employment,"" said Dean.The current high inflation rate in the UK and cost-of-living increases have put a lot of pressure on people, said Madeleine Stevens, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University.""After working through the pandemic the morale was an all-time high at one point, and then it was an all-time low,"" a nurse told Xinhua.""And now is the time to give the nurses what they and the rest of Britain´s National Health Service (NHS) deserve. After everything they've done, they work back-to-back shifts, no days off, for very little pay,"" the nurse said.Stevens told Xinhua: ""I think the wave of industrial action we see now is not only a roller coaster effect from the rail strikes and the Royal Mail, and then it´s kind of growing in momentum, but also with Christmas time coming people are feeling pressure and worries. It´s driven by fear, which is very unpleasant.""There could even be further consequences than the strikes, Stevens said. ""It could be more than just the public service sector that´s struggling with pay awards and the cost of living. It impacts every single one of us. So there is a risk, if the demand for pay goes up, that it will have further implications for the wider community,"" she said.""And perhaps a strategy to consider is to rather look at some of the causes that will benefit across the board, the nation across the board,"" Stevens suggested.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1217/c90000-10185233.html,17,12,2022,uk,pdo
'Historic' COP15 deal reached on biodiversity - People's Daily Online,"'Historic' COP15 deal reached on biodiversityBy LIU YINMENG and RENA LI in Montreal (Chinadaily.com.cn) 09:21, December 20, 2022A worker pushes a cart past the China Pavilion of the second part of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Montreal, Canada, on Dec. 6, 2022. (Photo/Xinhua)After two weeks of intense debate at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, or COP15, delegates from around the world agreed on Monday to adopt a landmark plan to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.""This is a historic moment,"" said Huang Runqiu, COP15 president and China´s minister of ecology and environment, who noted that the adoption was the result of numerous efforts by all parties.""Finally, we reached our destiny. We adopted the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,"" he announced.The new framework is a commitment by 196 parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to conserve at least 30 percent of the Earth´s land and ocean area by the next decade. It also will increase the expected annual financial assistance from developed countries through 2030 to help developing nations with biodiversity protection.Furthermore, it promises to reduce government subsidies that are harmful to nature by at least $500 billion per year, addresses the rights of indigenous people, and calls for gender equity in the implementation of the framework.Agreement on adopting the milestone Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework came after four years of discussions and two weeks of intense negotiations. It is the first global framework on biodiversity since the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were adopted 12 years ago.In an exclusive interview with China Daily after the agreement´s adoption, Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said he was ""very happy"" with the outcome.""It´s a historic day for the world. Some people have compared it to the 'Paris Moment', when the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, and I agree it is. It is a historic moment for nature protection around the world. I congratulate the Chinese presidency (of COP15) ... They did fantastic work, we worked very closely together, and it was a great partnership,"" he said.COP15 convened delegates from around the world in Montreal from Dec 7 to Monday to decide on the terms of the post-2020 biodiversity framework.The plenary session to adopt the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was originally scheduled to begin at 7:30 pm local time on Sunday, with the intention of sealing a deal early. However, the session was delayed as negotiations among top officials continued behind closed doors while delegates waited anxiously.At around 2:45 am on Monday, the last official day of the summit, Huang entered the room to announce the start of the plenary meeting. At 3:30 am, when he said that the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework had been adopted, loud applause and cheers greeted the announcement.While waiting for the outcome, Hugo Maria Schally, an adviser on international negotiations from the European Union, said that the ""Chinese presidency is working hard behind the scenes to get us a deal"".Rosalind Helfand, a researcher from the University of Cambridge´s Conservation Leadership Alumni Network who attended the conference on behalf of UN Women, said she hoped to see a global biodiversity framework that helps communicate the importance of a global agreement to save nature.""And that´s why I think that Section K of the framework, which is all about communication, and outreach and awareness and uptake, I think that that´s actually a really important section. And I think there´s some ambitious planning for that. And I really hope to see that happen,"" said Helfand.Section K calls for ""enhanced communication, education and awareness on biodiversity"" by all actors to ensure the effective implementation of the agreement.As COP15 president, China submitted a draft text of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework on Sunday morning that listed 23 targets for achievement by 2030.The new framework includes consensus on several issues that were considered a sticking point throughout the negotiations, including resource commitments from developed countries. Estimates suggested that a $700 billion annual funding gap needed to be closed in the next decade for the biodiversity framework to be effectively implemented.As part of the new deal, parties will collectively mobilize at least $200 billion per year by 2030. The money will come from public and private sources.Specifically, countries from the Global North agreed to scale up conservation funding for developing nations, small-island states and ""countries with economies in transition"" to at least $20 billion per year by 2025, and to $30 billion per year by 2030.During the first part of COP15 in Kunming in October last year, President Xi Jinping set the tone by investing 1.5 billion yuan ($215 million) to establish the Kunming Biodiversity Fund to support biodiversity protection in developing countries. He invited other nations to contribute.Countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Japan, Norway, Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands, along with the European Union, have pledged to increase their financial support to developing nations.So far, the total amount of international biodiversity commitments publicly announced by governments, philanthropists, corporations and investors stands at $8.3 billion annually, according to a tracker by several environmental organizations, including Campaign for Nature and Conservation International.The framework creates a new biodiversity fund within the UN´s existing Global Environment Facility. This came about as a compromise between developing nations, which wanted a new fund, and developed countries, which did not.The deal also recognizes the roles and contributions of indigenous people.In a statement, The International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity thanked the COP15 president for including ""strong language on respect for the rights of indigenous people and local communities"".All UN member states except the US have ratified the international treaty on biodiversity.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1220/c90000-10185982.html,20,12,2022,uk,pdo

About nine hours later, a second, magnitude 7.5, quake struck the region.The team was called to the site after their Turkish counterparts discovered signs of life while clearing a pile of rubble. During the operation, the Chinese rescuers squeezed a flexible endoscope camera through small gaps in the debris to survey the conditions beneath. They also worked with Turkish rescuers to break up the surface of rubble to gain access to the woman and extract her safely.On Saturday evening, with technical support from the Chinese team, Turkish rescuers successfully saved a man during a joint search mission in Antakya where survivors were found the previous day.The 82-member official Chinese team has been working closely with its international counterparts from Italy, the United Kingdom, Serbia, Slovakia and Oman, ensuring that search and rescue missions are well coordinated.Meanwhile, a 59-member team sent by the Hong Kong government pulled three survivors from six-meter-deep rubble in Hatay on Saturday.Yiu Men-yeung, head of the HK team, said that it was exciting to find the survivors six days after the earthquake. Rescuers will do their best to search for more people and won't give up hope, Yiu added.China´s civilian rescue teams also continued to search for survivors over the weekend. As of Friday morning, 15 civilian Chinese rescue teams, comprising 288 members, had made it to quake-hit regions in Turkiye.On Saturday, the Rescue Team of Ramunion helped locate seven people trapped in an apartment building in Iskenderun, Hatay, after 10 hours of searching. Unfortunately, they were all dead, the team´s command center said.The Ramunion team has been involved in search and rescue missions in four cities in Hatay since arriving in Turkiye on Wednesday. By Saturday night, the team had found seven survivors.Meanwhile, China also delivered on Saturday morning its first earthquake relief supplies to Turkiye, including tents and medical equipment, according to the China International Development Cooperation Agency.The death toll in Turkiye and Syria surpassed 33,000 on Sunday, AP reported.Zhao Mi, a Chinese national who has lived in Antakya since 2019, survived the earthquake. While receiving treatment at a hospital, she recalled the terrifying moment the quake struck early in the morning.She and her children were sleeping in separate bedrooms when the 15-story apartment building they had been living in collapsed on Monday, Chinese media reported on Saturday.""The building first started to shake violently. When it collapsed, I immediately curled up my body. I was buried in darkness and couldn't move,"" the 32-year-old said.She could hear her daughter, 9, and son, 13, calling for help and they were soon rescued from the rubble.Zhao was pulled from the ruins about 25 hours after the building collapsed. ""I used toilet tissue to soak up rainwater dripping down from the rubble and then squeezed the water into my mouth to survive. The water also kept me alert so I could call for help,"" she said.Zhao was being treated for multiple fractures in a hospital. Her daughter was in the intensive care unit of another hospital for multiple fractures and injuries to her organs.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0213/c90000-10206582.html,13,2,2023,uk,pdo

(Xinhua/Luo Xiaoguang)The Saudi-Iranian agreement to restore diplomatic relation was hailed by Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, as ""a victory for dialogue and peace"" and has been widely welcomed worldwide.The European Union (EU) on Saturday joined countries including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Iraq, Cuba and Pakistan to welcome the agreement, saying in a statement posted on its website that it ""acknowledges the diplomatic efforts leading to this important step.""The United Nations (UN) has also praised China´s role in the process.""The secretary-general has expressed his appreciation to the People´s Republic of China for hosting these recent talks and for promoting dialogue between the two countries,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said after the agreement was reached.DEAL GOES BEYOND SECURITY SPHERESaudi Arabia and Iran have been at odds over a range of issues for years and have backed opposing sides in conflicts in countries like Yemen and Syria.In early 2016, Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran in response to attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran after the kingdom executed a Shiite cleric.Before they clinched the deal in Beijing, the two countries had held five rounds of talks in Iraq to improve bilateral relations since 2021.""The Saudi-Iranian agreement achieved with Chinese mediation is a significant development in regional geopolitics,"" wrote Faisal J. Abbas, editor-in-chief of Arab News, in an article published on the website of the Saudi-based English language daily newspaper on Saturday, adding that it ""could be a true game-changer, heralding an era of regional peace and prosperity not seen in decades.""As Iran and Saudi Arabia are two powerful nations in the Middle East and the Muslim world, a peaceful and friendly relationship could bring more peace and stability to the region and the world, said Mohammad Reza Manafi, editor-in-chief for the Asia-Pacific news desk of Iran´s official news agency IRNA.""The move means a lot to both countries, as it will ease tensions between Shias and Sunnis,"" said Adnan Bourji, director of the Lebanese National Center for Studies.The reconciliation between the two regional rivals could set an example for other countries to follow in solving conflicts through dialogue, Bourji said.The ease of tensions will give Iran more room to handle repercussions of harsh sanctions imposed by the United States, while it will also calm the Saudi borders with Yemen, where Saudi-led coalition is engaged in a military conflict with Iran-backed Houthi militia, analysts say.Khaled Hamade, a Lebanese military analyst and retired brigadier general, told Xinhua that the China-brokered Saudi-Iran deal includes points related directly to the Yemeni crisis, such as the respect of other countries' sovereignty, and non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs.GOODWILL TO PROMOTE GLOBAL SECURITYWang Yi, who chaired both the opening and closing ceremonies of the Saudi-Iranian talks in Beijing, said the dialogue between the two countries in Beijing has ""become a successful practice for the strong implementation of the Global Security Initiative (GSI).""Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, presides over the closing meeting of the talks between a Saudi delegation and an Iranian delegation in Beijing, capital of China, March 10, 2023. (Xinhua/Luo Xiaoguang)The initiative, which was proposed by China in 2022, seeks to address the complex and intertwined security challenges with a win-win mindset.""We will continue to play a constructive role in properly handling hotspot issues in today´s world in accordance with the wishes of all countries and demonstrate our responsibility as a major country,"" Wang said.Analysts believe China´s successful hosting of the talks, which led to the breakthrough, highlights Beijing´s goodwill and endeavor to promote peace in the Middle East through political dialogue, as well as its efforts to advance the implementation of the GSI that seeks to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts and promote durable peace and development in the world.China´s successful mediation in the Saudi-Iranian deal proves that the world is open to an order characterized by multilateralism championed by China, instead of an order characterized by unilateralism the United States has enforced over the past decades, said Bourji.The Saudi-Iranian deal´s success has reflected the different approaches adopted by the United States and China in the Middle East, he added.""China handles (its diplomatic relations) in a spirit of friendship, persuasion, and the realization of mutual interests, while the United States handles (its diplomatic relations) in a spirit of imposition, hegemony, and ensuring American and Israeli interests at the expense of Arab dignity and interests,"" he added.The solutions proposed by China, which seek to solve international problems through mutual benefit, peaceful consultation, non-violent and non-military means, have gained more and more recognition around the world, said Dai Xiaoqi, professor at the School of Middle Eastern Studies of Beijing International Studies University.China´s ""balanced relations"" with both Saudi Arabia and Iran allowed it to accomplish the significant achievement, said Osama Danura, a political expert based in the Syrian capital Damascus.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0314/c90000-10221827.html,14,3,2023,uk,pdo

London, a leading foreign exchange market, has also actively adopted the internationalization of the renminbi, he added.Stressing the importance of green development, McLean said that ""green is the new driver"" of UK-China financial cooperation. Both countries have been keen players in green finance, such as green bond issuance, he said.McLean, also chair of the UK-China Business Development Center and a senior adviser to the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK, listed several other areas in which businesses in the UK and China could further cooperate. These include education, pharmaceuticals, the arts, green energy and electric vehicles.McLean said that although the people-to-people and government-to-government exchanges between the UK and China were considerably reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, business-to-business ties have continued unabated.According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), UK-China trade in goods increased in 2022. China was the UK´s second largest trading partner in goods imports and the fifth largest in goods exports.Asked about his expectations for China´s economic performance in the near future, McLean said he was optimistic. He cited early data from the first two months of this year as indicating that a 5 percent economic growth in 2023 could be a reality rather than just a forecast.""What we have to do is ensure that Chinese businesses feel welcome in the UK and that it applies the other way round,"" McLean said.Founded in 1903, the IoD is one of the UK´s longest running organizations for company directors, senior business leaders and entrepreneurs from various sectors, including finance, property, education and international trade.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219812.html,10,3,2023,uk,pdo

Conditions ripe for international students to return to China - People's Daily Online,"Conditions ripe for international students to return to ChinaBy Zou Shuo  (China Daily) 13:57, February 21, 2023After a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, numbers are set to quickly rise to reach levels seen before the outbreak. China´s rich culture, history, innovation and rapid growth and development in economic and technological terms will continue to attract international students, according to those already studying in the country.The cuisine, rich scenery and friendliness of the Chinese people have all left good impressions on the students, who are happy to promote friendship and closeness between citizens of their home countries and Chinese people.They said China´s optimization of its COVID-19 epidemic control measures means more international students will come to the country to study.A lack of understanding, knowledge and awareness often creates the biggest misunderstandings, bias or even conflict, and having international students from different countries in China is an opportunity to show the country to those at home from a genuine perspective and establish a stronger bridge between different cultures, they added.Unofficial 'ambassadors'The students are a link between China and their own countries, bringing different perspectives and acting as ""ambassadors"" for China at home, they said.Hasan Mahady is a second-year undergraduate at Beijing Jiaotong University. The 23-year-old from Bangladesh said China is one of the safest countries in the world, noting that Beijing is one of the largest and busiest places in China, yet there is almost no crime in the city.The cost of studying in China is relatively low, compared with places such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and European countries. Given the guarantee of quality education, international students who decide to study in China are less burdened financially, he said.As the government invests to provide resources for universities and internationalize the education system, the country´s universities are increasingly well-respected globally, while more schools in China are listed in the Times Higher Education´s World University Rankings than ever before.""Chinese is not the most straightforward language, but it is not impossible to learn. It is one of the most widely spoken languages on Earth, and it looks good on resumes and job applications. China has a lot of opportunities if we speak good Chinese,"" Mahady said.Minh David Thao Chan is a second-year PhD candidate at Tsinghua University, focusing on information technology and telecommunications.The 30-year-old from France said he thinks China has become a leader in technology and will attract intellectuals from across the globe, just as the United States did 30 years ago.China offers many learning opportunities and methodologies, and has great economic development potential, he said.The main reasons he came to China are the culture and language, a willingness to challenge himself, and the improved financial opportunities after graduation, he said.Mexican national Jorge Filio, 25, is studying for a master´s in Chinese Studies at Peking University´s Yenching Academy.He said that the optimization of the epidemic restrictions means China will definitely regain its position as an academic beacon for the best students from the developing world across many disciplines.Filio came to China for the first time in 2017 for a summer program at Tsinghua University´s School of Environment. It took less than a month for him to learn that China is the best environment to grow academically and professionally, he said.""Therefore, I made up my mind to pursue postgraduate studies in Beijing. China is the most different environment that I can think of, and so it is the perfect way to challenge myself,"" he said.Mexico is repositioning itself as a manufacturing hub in North America, encouraging near-shoring and the relocation of transnational companies. The move offers an opportunity to reassess Mexico´s relationship with China and look for industries in which Chinese companies have a technological advantage, then push for their introduction to the Mexican market, he added.Rapid developmentPhearum Vannaseka is an undergraduate at Beijing Jiaotong University, majoring in financial management. The 21-year-old Cambodian native believes that more students from her country will come to China to study as the country optimizes its epidemic control measures.China has rapidly developed its economy, technology and education system, she said. ""As an international student studying in China, I have firsthand knowledge of the fact that Chinese universities don't just teach theories and principles; they also conduct experiments. As a result, the students quickly understand the lessons and their enthusiasm in class increases,"" she said.She added that she came to China to study because it is a highly diverse and historic country.""There are many things to discover and do in China, but the main attraction, in my opinion, is tied to the amazing architecture, delectable cuisine, martial arts and lengthy history of creation,"" she said. She added that Chinese people are genuinely helpful and courteous, and she was pleasantly surprised by how polite they are.""They are really kind to foreigners like me, young and old alike. For instance, I frequently got lost on the street early on, but every time I asked, the local people responded in kind voices and with friendly smiles. I had a homey feeling overall,"" she said.Isidore Chitosi, 23, from Malawi, is a postgraduate student in civil engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University. He decided to study the subject in China because in recent years, the country has made headlines across the globe for its ""skyscraper boom"", and the related buildings are famous for going beyond the boundaries of traditional engineering.In addition, bilateral agreements between China and Malawi have involved China playing a huge role in the construction of some of his country´s key infrastructure, such as the new parliament building in Lilongwe, the capital, and the Malawi University of Science and Technology, he said.""The thing I find most impressive about Chinese people is their admirable work ethic — they always take an earnest approach to completing tasks,"" he said.He added that international students can act as a bridge between the two countries. By gaining an understanding of both cultures, they can help identify the mutual interests and common goals that exist between countries.Chen Shin Ni, 22, is a Malaysian student majoring in pharmaceutical sciences at Tsinghua University.She thinks that many international students will study in China because the education system is good, the living environment is safe and the cost of living is acceptable.International students can help strengthen the relationship between their home country and China by becoming ""ambassadors"" for their countries and sharing their culture and experiences with students from other countries, especially with those from China, she said.Motogo Mangue Mariano Mba, 25, from Equatorial Guinea, is a senior in optoelectronic information science and engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University.""Every time I am asked why I have come to China, my answer is 'Why not?' In recent years, I have grown, matured and fallen in love with the culture, the people and, most importantly, the convenience and safety of China,"" he said.He thinks more students will come to China because no other country in human history has done what China is doing in terms of development and helping the whole world develop.Language of choiceIn addition, he thinks that Mandarin is becoming a language everyone should learn, just like China is a country everyone should visit.""What has impressed me most is the kindness of the people and their ability to make you feel welcome,"" he said.""Chinese people are clear, practical and realistic. They respect all cultures and they understand how important mutual respect is between people from different backgrounds.""As China has some of the world´s largest information and communications technology markets, the country can provide him with the opportunity to build a lucrative career and the skills to develop further within this critical and growing area, he said.""With all that being said, I know people will come to China because it is the future — there is no better place to be right now if you want to make history.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0221/c90000-10210713.html,21,2,2023,uk,pdo

(Xinhua/Shadati)ANKARA, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- In 2022, Türkiye launched a diplomatic offensive with a number of initiatives to mend fences with regional rivals and actively mediate the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Analysts said that Türkiye, which has complicated or tense relations with many regional heavyweights, played a big role in the shifting of geopolitics in the Middle East in the past year.As Türkiye´s economy struggled with shrinking trade and investment as well as skyrocketing inflation in 2022, the country increased its regional influence with its diplomatic initiatives to normalize ties with Gulf countries, Israel and Egypt.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R) welcomes Saudi Arabia´s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud in Ankara, Turkey, on June 22, 2022.

The two countries signed a dozen of agreements on cooperation in trade, agriculture, technology, defense and other sectors. Analysts said that the shared concerns over Iran were behind the reconciliation between the two countries which had feuded over many regional issues.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R) and Israeli President Isaac Herzog attend a joint press conference in Ankara, Turkey, on March 9, 2022.

Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the relations between the two neighbors have deteriorated.""Türkiye does not have the luxury of closing in, isolating itself from the outside world and watching the events in its region by sitting on the fence,"" Erdogan, who is facing a presidential election in 2023, said in an address to the Turkish parliament in October.

Mideast tourism market gears up to welcome back Chinese tourists - People's Daily Online,"Mideast tourism market gears up to welcome back Chinese tourists (Xinhua) 13:44, January 09, 2023TUNIS/CAIRO, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- China´s move to downgrade the management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B starting from Sunday has excited governmental officials and tourism industry players in the Middle East, who are gearing up to welcome back Chinese tourists absent for three years due to the pandemic.LONG-AWAITED RETURN OF CHINESE TOURISTSChina has continuously optimized its COVID-19 responses, the latest of which will be lifting restrictions on citizens' outbound trips as of Sunday. The move is warmly welcomed by tourism practitioners in the Middle East.""We are so happy to hear the good news,"" Amir Ben Aribia, general manager of the Tunisian travel company Tunisia Blue Sky, told Xinhua.With Chinese tourists accounting for 90 percent of the company´s business before the pandemic outbreak, Ben Aribia has been closely following the adjustment of China´s COVID-related policies.Karim Mohammed, a souvenir shop owner in the famous Khan El Khalili bazaar in Egypt´s capital of Cairo, said that he expected Chinese tourists to return to Egypt soon.As the Belt and Road cooperation runs through the Middle East region where more countries offer visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry to Chinese citizens, the number of Chinese arrivals has surged in the pre-pandemic years.In 2016, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) started to grant visas to Chinese visitors upon arrival. In 2017, over 764,000 Chinese tourists visited the UAE, representing a 41-percent increase year on year.According to the 2020 report of Dubai Tourism, the easing of the UAE visa rules in 2016 led to the doubling of the number of Chinese visitors to the Gulf country in four years.When Saudi Arabia announced the issuance of tourist visas to visitors from 49 countries in 2019, China topped the number of tourist visas issued by the kingdom.Chinese tourists used to come in groups, which helped boost his business significantly, Mohammed said.Halis Aydogan, an official of the Turkish company Pasha Balloon Tours, told Xinhua that in Cappadocia, famous for its hot air balloon tours, Chinese tourists accounted for nearly half of some 600,000 balloon trip takers in 2019.HUGE POTENTIAL FOR MIDDLE EASTDespite the rapid growth, China remains a tourism market with huge potential for the Middle East. Experts believe the return of Chinese tourists would have a positive impact on a wide range of sectors in the region.""Not only does a hotel stay benefit the hospitality industry, but visitor spending in retail and leisure activities boosts demand for employment and stimulates the wider economy,"" Ross Curran, an assistant professor at Edinburgh Business School at Heriot-Watt University Dubai, told The National, an English daily newspaper with headquarters in Abu Dhabi.Meanwhile, the return of Chinese tourists would strengthen cultural exchanges between China and the Mideast countries in the long run.Chinese tourists show more interest in the historical sites and natural landscapes, Ben Aribia said, adding that the Chinese travel style brings the industry a stable and handsome income.That is why Tunisia Blue Sky has focused on the Chinese market in recent years, he said.Abedulrazzak Abo Mohaisen, a Jordanian who owns a workshop selling his handcrafted traditional Arabic daggers near the historical Roman Theater of Amman, said he expected a prosperous season brought by the return of Chinese visitors.""I believe that good numbers of Chinese tourists will revive tourism in Jordan. China is a major country with an ancient civilization, and cooperation with it in this sector will be very promising,"" he said.Saudi Arabia´s Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said that he hopes more Chinese tourists would visit and learn about Saudi heritage, culture, and people.""China is one of Saudi Arabia´s main trade partners, and we have been enjoying Chinese culture and heritage for many years, especially the delicious food that can be found everywhere in Saudi Arabia. Now, we want the Chinese to come,"" the minister told Xinhua before the 116th World Tourism Organization Executive Council Meeting in Jeddah.PREPARATIONS FOR NEW TOURIST WAVEWith restrictions on Chinese citizens' outbound trips lifted, a surge in numbers in 2023 is expected. Analysts noted that the travel industry needs to remain flexible to respond to changing conditions.International tourism arrivals, up 60 percent in 2022, will rise by a further 30 percent in 2023, with Chinese tourists acting as a great impetus to the growth, according to the London-based Economist.For now, hoteliers and travel agents in the Middle East are making preparations for a new wave of Chinese tourists.""We sit and work with our friends ... to plan on receiving Chinese visitors and organizing new tours and destinations in the city,"" Serhan Kochan, a tour operator for the Ligarba Travel Agency in the largest Turkish city of Istanbul, told Xinhua.He said his teams are creating unique excursion tours to cover some newly restored or opened tourist destinations along the coast of the sea.Irfan Karsli, head of the Ligarba Travel Agency, said Chinese tour groups are expected to start visiting Türkiye in April and the arrivals of large numbers of Chinese tourists would help boost the country´s ailing economy.Elhamy Al-Zayyat, a tourism expert and former head of the Egyptian Tourism Federation, said that Egypt targets a 30-percent rise in tourists per year after China lifts overseas travel restrictions, but promotional campaigns alone are not enough.""We need interesting services and innovative measures so as to lure Chinese tourists and challenge other competing markets,"" he said.Al-Zayyat also hoped that Egypt would cooperate with Chinese travel agencies to attract more Chinese tourists by providing interesting projects.""Chinese tourists will be impressed when they return to Egypt, because Khan al-Khalili has undergone a comprehensive development process that increased its beauty while preserving the Islamic heritage nature of the place,"" said Mohammed Saleh, an owner of a traditional Egyptian food restaurant in the bazaar.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0109/c90000-10193495.html,09,1,2023,uk,pdo

CHINA DAILYOverseas expansion plans target new customers, additional incomeHotpot chain Xiabuxiabu recently opened its first overseas store in Singapore, introducing its renowned small-pot individual servings, along with a special sesame sauce.To cater to local customers' preferences, these meals are selected from five options created specifically for the overseas market, including pickled cabbage golden soup and pepper pork stomach and chicken soup. All options are served with a mushroom soup base.The chain plans to expand further by opening a total of six overseas stores this year in Singapore and Malaysia.Chinese restaurant businesses are accelerating their expansion plans in foreign markets. Large chains and smaller-sized brands are targeting Southeast Asia — particularly Singapore — as well as North America.Such expansion has shifted from targeting overseas Chinese to attracting local customers. It has also transitioned from small-scale fragmented operations to specialized and network-based businesses with local supply chains, reflecting the growing popularity of Chinese cuisine and the global appeal of the nation´s culture.Coucou, another Xiabuxiabu hotpot brand, launched in Singapore a year ago. For many Chinese restaurant businesses, Singapore is their first choice for overseas expansion, as the city state has a sizable Chinese population and a multicultural society that enjoys different types of cuisine.Taier Chinese Sauerkraut Fish opened its first overseas store at Changi Airport in Singapore in August 2021, while Meow Barbecue launched its first store on foreign soil in Singapore in September.Tanyu, a restaurant chain focusing on roasted fish, has opened five stores in Singapore. Li Xiaoshuai, a spokesman for Tanyu´s franchise expansion, told Chuhaitimes, a news website covering Chinese companies exploring foreign markets, that when choosing a location. The main consideration is whether it fits the company´s customer base of overseas Chinese, including students.Dishes offered by Tanyu feature flavors popular in China, giving overseas Chinese a taste of home.Li said that for financial reasons, more than half the materials used by Tanyu´s Singaporean outlets are imported from China through third-party channels, including kitchen utensils. Fish, the core ingredient, is sourced from Vietnam.Tanyu´s stores in Singapore operate in a franchise system and are managed by local teams. Li said the company´s headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, arranges online training to maintain consistency with its food produced in China.Annual revenue from a single Tanyu outlet is about 19 million yuan ($2.74 million), and Li said the business plans to expand to 10 to 20 overseas destinations in the next two to three years.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0316/c90000-10223233.html,16,3,2023,uk,pdo
Chinese universities climb world rankings - People's Daily Online,"Chinese universities climb world rankingsBy ZOU SHUO (China Daily) 10:51, November 14, 2022Graduates attend the 2019 commencement ceremony of Tsinghua University in Beijing on July 7, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua]Chinese institutions of higher learning are on the rise in global university rankings, as the country strives to elevate a number of them to world-class status.In the 2022-2023 Best Global University Rankings published recently by US News& World Report, 338 Chinese universities were among the schools listed, exceeding the 280 listed for the United States, 105 for Japan and 92 for the United Kingdom. The new rankings include 2,000 universities from more than 90 countries.It is the first time that China had more universities in the rankings than the US. However, the majority of US universities appear in the top half of the rankings, including eight of the top 10.Tsinghua University´s ranking rose three places to 23rd, making it the highest-ranked university in Asia. Meanwhile, Peking University´s place rose from 45 to 39.Among the top 10 schools for artificial intelligence, five were from China, including Tsinghua University, the No 1. Carnegie Mellon University ranked 12th in the sector, making it the best US university for AI research.According to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2023, seven universities from China were ranked in the world´s top 100, up from six last year.Tsinghua University and Peking University were ranked 16th and 17th, respectively. The other five were Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, the University of Science and Technology of China and Nanjing University.Xiong Bingqi, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, said universities should not be too preoccupied with rankings. Experts have also cautioned that university rankings are based on evaluation standards that differentiate and that universities and people should view them more objectively.Nevertheless, Chinese universities have put great emphasis on academic research, which is more of an issue in the evaluation of world university rankings, and have achieved progress in rankings, Xiong said.Chinese universities should also focus on nurturing top-notch students to achieve the goal of creating ""world-class universities with Chinese characteristics"", he said.Renmin University of China said in April that it had withdrawn from all international rankings and Nanjing University said that it ""no longer considers international rankings a development target"" during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period. Columbia University announced in July it would not participate in the next US News& World Report´s university rankings.Chen Zhiwen, editor-in-chief of the online education portal EOL, said none of the rankings are perfect and they cannot reflect the overall situation and strength of universities.The Chinese government has advocated getting rid of an overreliance on the number of papers and academic titles in the evaluation of universities, while putting more emphasis on training students.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1114/c90000-10170787.html,14,11,2022,uk,pdo

(Photo by Jon Super/Xinhua)Mortgage rates were still over three times higher than they were a year ago, pricing many out of the market, while many more potential buyers would fail lenders' affordability tests, which had become tougher to pass since the central bank has hiked the bank rate, said Gabriella Dickens, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy.At the same time, households' real disposable incomes would be squeezed further in the second quarter by the watering down of government support for energy bills, Dickens added.Earlier this month, a report published by mortgage provider Nationwide Building Society also showed that annual house price growth slowed to 1.1 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December.Month-on-month, January saw a further price fall of 0.6 percent, which left prices 3.2 percent lower than their August peak after taking account of seasonal effects. The monthly decline was the fourth in a row, marking the longest period of consecutive falls since 2009.""Nationwide´s data show that house prices are continuing to buckle under the pressure of elevated mortgage rates, squeezed real incomes and weakened consumer confidence,"" Dickens said.Photo taken on Sept. 2, 2020 shows estate agency signs in Reading, Britain.

Accelerating rate of mountain forest loss globally threatens biodiversity hotspots: study - People's Daily Online,"Accelerating rate of mountain forest loss globally threatens biodiversity hotspots: study (Xinhua) 10:52, March 20, 2023Photo taken on Aug. 24, 2022 shows a fire site in the forest area of the central resort town of Borjomi, Georgia. (Photo by Tamuna Kulumbegashvili/Xinhua)GUANGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese researchers along with their counterparts from Britain have found that global mountain forests are disappearing at an accelerating rate, putting increasing pressure on threatened species.The study published on Saturday in the journal One Earth under Cell Press showed that about 78.1 million hectares or 7.1 percent of mountain forest have been lost since 2000, and what made it worse, much of the loss took place in tropical biodiversity hotspots.The researchers from the Southern University of Science and Technology in China and the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom tracked changes in mountain forests on a yearly basis from 2001 to 2018.The annual rate of loss increased by 50 percent from 2001-2009 to 2010-2018, with approximately 5.2 million hectares of mountain forests lost per year.Logging was the biggest cause of mountain forest loss overall (42 percent), followed by wildfires (29 percent), ""slash-and-burn"" cultivation (15 percent) and permanent or semi-permanent agriculture (10 percent), according to their findings.According to the researchers, this acceleration resulted probably largely from rapid agricultural expansion into highland areas in Southeast Asia, and increased logging of mountain forests.Particularly, tropical mountain forests experienced the maximum loss and the most rapid acceleration rate, but the good news is that these forests saw a faster rate of regrowth compared to mountain forests in temperate and boreal regions, according to the study.More than 85 percent of the world´s bird, mammal, and amphibian species live in mountains, particularly in forest habitats, according to the study.To protect sensitive species in biodiversity hotspots, the integrity of forests in large enough zones must be maintained, beyond simply preventing forest loss, the researchers said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0320/c90000-10224670.html,20,3,2023,uk,pdo

[Photos by Li Ran/For chinadaily.com.cn]Despite projected emissions declines from China and the European Union, the world´s overall carbon emissions this year remain at record levels, with no sign of the decrease urgently needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 C, according to a recent study.The world´s total global carbon dioxide emissions in 2022 are projected to be 40.6 billion metric tons, said the Global Carbon Budget report, which was produced by an international team of over 100 scientists.They are fueled by fossil-fuel generated CO2 emissions that are projected to rise 1 percent compared with 2021 to 36.6 billion tons, slightly above the 2019 pre-COVID 19 levels, noted the report as climate diplomats recently met at the COP27 United Nations climate change conference in Egypt.If current emissions levels persist, there is now a 50 percent chance that global warming of 1.5 C will be exceeded in nine years, it says.The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change aims to keep the global temperature rise this century below 2 C from preindustrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 C.The 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body that assesses the science behind climate change, highlighted a series of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 C.By the end of this century, for example, the rise in global sea levels would be 10 centimeters lower with a temperature increase of 1.5 C compared with 2 C.""This year we see yet another rise in global fossil CO2 emissions, when we need a rapid decline,"" said Pierre Friedlingstein of the University of Exeter´s Global Systems Institute, who led the study.There are some positive signs, but leaders meeting at COP27 will have to take meaningful action if the world is to have any chance of limiting global warming close to 1.5 C.""The Global Carbon Budget numbers monitor the progress on climate action and right now we are not seeing the action required,"" he said.This year´s carbon budget shows that the long-term rate of increasing CO2 emissions has slowed. The average rise peaked at 3 percent per year during the 2000s, while growth in the last decade has been about 0.5 percent annually.The 2022 picture among major emitters is mixed. Emissions are projected to fall by 0.9 percent in China and 0.8 percent in the EU, according to the report. An increase of 6 percent is expected for India, 1.5 percent for the United States and 1.7 percent for the rest of the world combined.Corinne Le Quere, a professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, said the team´s findings reveal turbulence in emissions patterns this year resulting from the pandemic and global energy crises.If governments respond by turbo-charging clean energy investments, and plant — not cut down — trees, global emissions could rapidly start to fall, Le Quere said.""We are at a turning point and must not allow world events to distract us from the urgent and sustained need to cut our emissions to stabilize the global climate and reduce cascading risks,"" she said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1119/c90000-10173713.html,19,11,2022,uk,pdo
US sowed 20 years of misery - People's Daily Online,"US sowed 20 years of miseryBy JAN YUMUL in Hong Kong  (China Daily) 09:36, March 20, 2023Renewed calls for justice over invasion of Iraq without UN consentEditor´s note: On March 20, 2003, the United States launched a military invasion of Iraq, the second time it fought a war in that country in a little more than 10 years. Now, two decades after war broke out, China Daily reviews how the US broke a unified state at the heart of the Arab world with falsehoods, opening a power vacuum and leaving oil-rich Iraq a wounded nation in the Middle East.Twenty years after the United States-led invasion of Iraq, the world continues to call for Washington to be held to account for its aggression and the misery it caused to millions of innocent Iraqis.The invasion of Iraq started on March 20, 2003, after Washington accused Baghdad of developing weapons of mass destruction. The claim was later found to be false. Kofi Annan, then United Nations secretary-general, termed the war illegal, saying the action was not in conformity with the UN Charter.Hassan Imran, a legal activist who is a board member at Law for Palestine, a nonprofit that has offices in Sweden and Manchester, England, noted that the US had acted unilaterally outside the collective ambit of the UN Security Council, citing a right to self-defense, but this had been very problematic in the eyes of a majority of international law experts.""Self-defense in international law has certain conditions, mainly that it should be against an imminent and proximate threat to one´s territory, and this was not met in this case,"" Imran said, adding that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.The unprovoked war also raises questions in regard to international governance and US double standards, as well as its self-assumed role as the regulator of international law to help bring alleged perpetrators of crimes to justice, observers and analysts say.According to the Costs of War project, which was founded more than a decade ago at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and was codirected by two scholars of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, it was estimated that the Iraq War could have cost US taxpayers more than $2 trillion.It noted that the ensuing war, in which the US ground presence peaked in 2007 with more than 170,000 soldiers, caused tens of thousands of deaths, destruction and political instability in Iraq. Further, among the consequences was ""the increase in sectarian politics, widespread violence and the rise of the Islamic State militant group with its terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East"".Although the US government officially ended its war in Iraq in 2011, the repercussions of the invasion and occupation, as well as subsequent and continuing military interventions, have had an enormous human, social, economic, and environmental toll, the study said.

""Building on my experiences during a visit last year, there is one stratum of society which is extremely rich and one section which is in the perils of extreme poverty — no in-between.""Iraq ""is only somewhat starting to recover from decades of tumultuous events"", she said, which include the 2003 US invasion, the 2014 anti-Islamic State coalition and regional proxy wars.""It took Iraq more than 30 years to settle the reparations for its invasion (of) Kuwait. The US invasion took place in 2003, so one can't expect (any such reparations to Iraq) to happen in the short to medium term,"" Siddiqa said, adding that Iraq has also failed to present a unified front.Last year, more than 30 years after the United Nations Compensation Commission was created to ensure restitution for Kuwait owing to Iraq´s invasion of 1990, the reparations body announced it had processed its final claim, amounting to $52.4 billion in total.According to the United Nations, 1.5 million successful claims were awarded, out of a total of about 2.7 million lodged with the commission. If all the claims had been found legitimate, it said, that would have meant a total payout of $352.5 billion.""Payment of reparations for an illegal invasion is a key principle of international humanitarian law,"" said Ahmad Ghouri, director of internationalization at the School of Law, Politics and Sociology at the University of Sussex in England.Paying reparations""By requiring new leadership of an invading country to pay reparations for an earlier regime´s actions, international law aims to deter future wars of aggression. Another aim is to provide transitional justice to people affected by illegal invasion.""He also cited the plight of refugees and other non-nationals in Iraq after the fall of the government of Saddam Hussein on April 11, 2003, which has been well documented.""However, no such compensation is demanded by the UN Security Council from the United States of America or the United Kingdom, although it has undoubtedly established that their joint invasion of Iraq in 2003 was illegal,"" Ghouri said.""All parties, including the US and the UK, committed war crimes including massacres and torture on a massive scale. On the face of this illegal invasion, the UN´s inaction to create a commission to compensate Iraq, its people, and foreigners affected by war is a mockery of international law and the law of war.""Iraqi journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi, who gained fame for hurling his shoes at President George W. Bush in a news conference to show his anger at the corruption and chaos that followed the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, said he is still furious.""The same people who entered 20 years ago with the occupier are still ruling despite failures and corruption.

The struggle to elect a new speaker shows the bitter divisions in U.S. politics - People's Daily Online,"The struggle to elect a new speaker shows the bitter divisions in U.S. politicsBy Tom Fowdy (China.org.cn) 09:31, January 12, 2023U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy (C) is seen in the House chamber as the House meets to elect a speaker in Washington, D.C., the United States, on Jan. 6, 2023. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)Kevin McCarthy was recently elected as the new speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The passing of the baton comes with the exit of Nancy Pelosi, who left her position following Republicans taking control of the House in the November 2022 mid-term elections. While one might have assumed the election of McCarthy was a formality, it proved to be anything but. The party´s narrow majority, combined with bitter internal politics, saw McCarthy lose 14 bids to be elected as the speaker due to a cohort of rebel legislators, led by Trump loyalist Matt Gaetz, who sought to impose several political conditionalities for his support, resulting in the group blocking his election again and again. Eventually, on the 15th try, McCarthy was elected to the post.Never since the American Civil War, in the mid-19th century, had the election of a U.S. House speaker been so contentious. Although he prevailed, as Reuters notes, it comes at a ""cost,"" one which involved ""making extensive concessions to right-wing hardliners that raised questions about the party´s ability to govern."" This speaks volumes about the current polarization of American politics, not least in the Republican Party, wherein the legacy of the former president has caused large-scale division both across the spectrum and within his own party, which has increasingly eroded the political center ground.The Republican Party has been in a civil war of sorts, wherein moderate or ""NeoConservative""-leaning Republicans have found themselves at odds with the ""Trump"" or ""MAGA"" faction, which espouses economic protectionism and hard-line nationalism. The former looks at the latter as being morally flawed and repulsive, while the latter sees the former as part of a corrupt establishment who do not vouch for the interests of ordinary people. This has led to a continual battle for influence in internal Republican party elections, such as primaries and nominations for various positions. When the GOP performed less well than expected in the 2022 mid-terms, including having lost the senate to the Democrats, the reaction of many was to blame the Trump faction for its perceived malign influence.But that hasn't settled the argument. On at least winning the House of Representatives, the Trumpian loyalists sought to undermine any attempt for a so-called moderate Republican in Kevin McCarthy to become Speaker of the House, taking no hesitation to undermine their own party in the first place. In doing so, this small faction of rebels is utilizing a tactic famously used in legislatures when the leading party only has a small majority, leveraging their numbers to strong-arm the ruling majority into taking on board their own political demands.This makes the ruling majority ""conditional,"" a phenomenon that has regularly been seen in the United Kingdom. For example, when the Conservative Party had a small ruling majority in the 1990s and from 2016-2019, pro-Brexit rebels repeatedly undermined the government. This effect is amplified when the political climate of a given country is polarized, and thus the ""fringe"" rebels have more backing in areas of public opinion to be able to politically gain from undermining the status quo. This reflects the current state of American democracy, which is increasingly contentious, bitter, and divided.The result is that Kevin McCarthy has been elected as a vastly weakened speaker. The Trumpian rebels will be able to force their demands and agenda onto various bills and items more successfully, which will have a destabilizing effect on American politics. This spells trouble for the Biden administration, who, while having gained the senate, will almost certainly find himself in contention with the House and a speaker who is forced to cater more to the party´s right wing. This will also spell further disruption to U.S.-China relations, as Trump-supporting representatives will be able to push anti-China items and influence the foreign policy of the U.S. in negative ways, irrespective of what the administration wants.The phenomenon of ""congressional gridlock,"" whereby the relationship between the executive and the legislature is defined by endless confrontation and frustration, is not a new thing in America, with every preceding president having faced it. However, a key is that in the increasingly divided and polarized environment of U.S. politics, this trend is only going to get worse and have more adverse effects. One simply has to look back at how Nancy Pelosi´s House of Representatives imposed the largest government shutdown ever in a conflict with the Trump administration over funding for his ""wall"" in 2018-2019. Keeping these previous events in mind, it looks as if American politics will face further bumpy roads ahead.Tom Fowdy is a British political and international relations analyst and a graduate of Durham and Oxford universities.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0112/c90000-10194977.html,12,1,2023,uk,pdo

(People´s Daily Online/Gu Changwang)As international organizations and investment institutions lifted their forecast on China´s economic growth this year, the international community has gained stronger confidence in the Chinese economy.There is an increasingly prevalent view that China will be a major driver of global recovery. It is anticipated that the Chinese economy will embrace brighter prospects and once again become the largest contributor to global growth.The lifted expectations on China´s growth mirror the country´s strong economic resilience.According to the recent World Economic Outlook report issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), growth in China is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in 2023, 0.8 percentage points higher than its previous forecast, and China´s economic growth will contribute around a quarter of global growth.The United Nations' World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2023 report said China´s economy is expected to grow by 4.8 percent this year, leading the economic recovery in East Asia.Besides, many international investment institutions including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and JPMorgan have lifted their forecasts on China´s economic growth in 2023.Yachts are seen sailing on the water in Sanya, south China´s Hainan province, Feb. 7, 2023.

According to the latest statistics, the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China´s manufacturing sector regained expansion this January, which also indicated a stable economic rebound.American weekly magazine Barron´s said that all the switches that can be switched on have been moved toward growth in China, and there´s a lot of momentum behind it.China, maintaining its commodity price at a relatively low level, has convinced the international community of its ample room for keeping proactive fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies.Last year, some countries witnessed soaring energy and food prices. For instance, the consumer price index (CPI) in December 2022 grew 6.5 percent year on year in the United States, 9.2 percent in the eurozone and 10.5 percent in the United Kingdom.A teacher and her students watch homemade lanterns at an elementary school in Changxing county, Huzhou, east China´s Zhejiang province, Feb. 6, 2023. (People´s Daily Online/Zhou Hongfeng)Global economic activities will still bear the pressure from high inflation this year. To bring inflation down and prevent the global economy from falling into recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, and the European Central Bank and the Bank of England followed this move to hike interest rates by 50 basis points.In contrast, China´s commodity price is generally stable. The country´s CPI rose 2 percent from a year ago in 2022.Vice President of the BRICS New Development Bank Leslie Maasdorp said China has ample fiscal space, which enables it to better adapt its economy following the recovery.To predict economic trends calls for studies into both short-term dynamic and long-term growth momentums.Boasting a population of more than 1.4 billion, per capita GDP of over $12,000 and 400 million middle-income earners, China is the world´s most promising super-large market.

Experts optimistic on overall price stability this year - People's Daily Online,"Experts optimistic on overall price stability this yearBy OUYANG SHIJIA (China Daily) 09:38, January 13, 2023Customers shop for Spring Festival decorations at a market in Taian, Shandong province, on Thursday. China´s consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, rose by 2 percent year-on-year in 2022, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. ZOU HONG/CHINA DAILYChina has favorable conditions and capabilities to maintain overall price stability in 2023 despite imported inflationary pressures and potential fluctuations in high international commodity prices, officials and experts said on Thursday.Compared with the soaring prices in major advanced economies, China´s inflation remains mild and controllable, leaving room for policy easing to bolster the economy amid headwinds and uncertainties, they said.China´s consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year in December, up from a 1.6 percent increase in November, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.Meanwhile, China´s producer price index, which gauges factory-gate prices, decreased by 0.7 percent year-on-year last month, after a 1.3 percent decline in November.Wan Jinsong, director of the National Development and Reform Commission´s Department of Price, said the country has solid foundations, as well as confidence and capabilities, to maintain overall price stability in 2023, given the sufficient supply of daily necessities, the stable supply of energy and an improved system for ensuring price and supply stability.Wan told a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that China´s overall price levels are generally stable as the country´s full-year consumer inflation rose by 2 percent year-on-year. In contrast, inflation in major advanced economies — the United States, the eurozone and the United Kingdom — as measured by CPI, was about 8 percent, above 8 percent and about 9 percent, respectively.""Unlike the rest of the world, China has continued to issue low inflation data due to weak domestic demand,"" said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, adding that the COVID-19 outbreaks severely curtailed economic activity in December, particularly in the services sector.Lu said his team expects CPI inflation to rise slightly to 2 percent year-on-year in January, mostly due to seasonal patterns, as the lunar New Year holiday takes place early this year compared with 2022.Meanwhile, PPI inflation will post a 0.5 percent year-on-year decline in January, mainly driven by the recent rise in some metal prices, he said.""Looking forward … we think inflation is not a major concern for China in 2023 and we expect the policy stance to remain accommodative,"" Lu said.A top government think tank forecast on Thursday that China´s consumer inflation will stay mild in 2023, cautioning that the risks of price increases beyond expectations still remain.The Center for Forecasting Science at the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates that China´s CPI will rise about 1.8 percent in 2023, while the PPI will decline by about 0.4 percent.Zhou Maohua, an analyst at China Everbright Bank, said the mild inflation levels will offer room for policymakers to intensify policy easing, and there is plenty of policy space to cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio — the proportion of money that lenders must hold as reserves — in the next few months.The latest data also offers the official snapshot of improved monetary conditions as China´s broad money supply, or M2, rose 11.8 percent year-on-year in December to 266.43 trillion yuan ($39.41 trillion), according to the People´s Bank of China, the country´s central bank.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0113/c90000-10195523.html,13,1,2023,uk,pdo

For the past week, he attended several fintech and venture capital-themed events in Hong Kong, during which he connected with potential clients and investors for his Finland-based fintech startup.""I always know Hong Kong as an international financial center, but I didn't know there is such a big fintech scene here,"" he told Xinhua during the ongoing 2022 Hong Kong Fintech Week, taking place in person and virtually from Monday to Friday.The event is attracting the attention of international investors and entrepreneurs. As an international financial center, Hong Kong is actively embracing technological innovation in the financial industry with open-mindedness and an updated regulatory framework, thereby further consolidating its financial hub status while creating new growth drivers.Paul Chan, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said in a video address to the event that Hong Kong had no more than 180 fintech companies five years ago, but the number rose to more than 800 as of today.""Many of them are founded by overseas talents, from Israel, France, the United Kingdom and many other places. And we ought to be proud that our fintech sector also gave birth to a number of unicorns,"" he said.The impressive growth has been powered by Hong Kong´s open market, a rigorous regulatory regime, the rule of law, sophisticated infrastructure and the free flow of capital and information, he said.Building on the already flourishing fintech scene is the HKSAR government´s latest open stance towards the development of virtual assets in Hong Kong.The HKSAR government on Monday issued a policy statement on the development of virtual assets (VA) in Hong Kong, saying that Hong Kong is open and inclusive towards the global community of innovators engaging in VA businesses.The HKSAR government would work with the financial regulators to provide a facilitating environment for promoting sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector in Hong Kong, the statement said.""We will put in place timely and necessary guardrails to mitigate actual and potential risks in line with international standards, so that virtual assets innovations can thrive in Hong Kong in a sustainable manner,"" it said.Adrian Cheng, chief executive officer of New World Development Company Limited, said that Hong Kong sees three major opportunities, including the possibility to become the digital financial asset issuance center, the chance to create a comprehensive ecosystem combining traditional and digital finance as well as the opportunity to cultivate a cross-border platform for blockchain development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.Hong Kong´s unique advantage of being backed by the motherland and connected to the world also has a role to play in fintech development. Federico Fontolan, who leads digital innovation at CRIF Hong Kong, a business information provider, said that the Italy-based company chose Hong Kong as its regional headquarters partly because of Hong Kong´s proximity to the Chinese mainland.""Here you have access to innovations from all over the world, and as China is one of our biggest markets, it´s always nice to be close to our customers,"" he said.Financial regulators from the Chinese mainland are also stepping up support for Hong Kong´s fintech development.Yi Gang, China´s central bank governor, said in his video address to the Hong Kong Fintech Week that the People´s Bank of China is cooperating with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and other monetary authorities on the Central Bank Digital Currency, or CBDC, as it attracted growing attention in recent years.""We hope such cooperation will better serve both global and domestic investors and help enhance Hong Kong´s role as an international financial center,"" he said.Cai Jianchun, general manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said that the exchange will leverage its experience and advantages in the coordinated development of fintech and the capital market to deepen its cooperation with Hong Kong and help consolidate Hong Kong´s status as an international financial hub.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1102/c90000-10166149.html,02,11,2022,uk,pdo

As of the close of trading on Feb 16, the sector index fell by 3.43 percent, with companies that had previously announced overseas expansion plans leading the decline, including Juhua Technology, Daotong Technology, and Shenghong, according to the report.However, US EV maker Tesla said the plan to produce charging stations domestically in the United States was too aggressive. Tesla has told the US Department of Transportation that, given the speed and scale of deployment, the new regulations could lead to an insufficient number of compliant charging stations.US companies in the industry have also said that global demand for electric vehicle charging stations is putting pressure on the supply chain, making it difficult to meet US manufacturing standards and accelerate the construction of new charging stations. They argue that requiring localization of parts too early could hinder the expansion of the charging network.In addition to charging stations, the United States also passed the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" in August last year, aiming to accelerate the localization process of electric vehicle batteries. The new law strengthens ""Made in America"" requirements, demanding that electric vehicles must be assembled in North America, and the materials and ""critical minerals"" in the batteries must come from the United States or countries that have a free trade agreement with the United States. Otherwise, consumers purchasing new electric vehicles will not be able to receive a $7,500 government subsidy.The above regulations have also directly impacted the progress of Contemporary Amperex Technology´s factory construction in the United States. Recently, in order to enter the US market, CATL has decided to adopt a new cooperative construction model with Ford, in which Ford will provide funding and CATL will provide technology to circumvent the restrictions of the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" regulations.Compared to the domestic market, the overseas new energy vehicle market has a more severe imbalance between the number of vehicles and the number of charging stations, which contains greater market dividends.According to a research report from Everbright Securities, as of April 2022, the ratio of the number of electric vehicles to the number of charging stations in the United States was 21.2:1, while in the European Union was 8.5:1, with Germany at 20:1, the United Kingdom at 16:1, France at 10:1, and the Netherlands at 5:1, all showing significant gaps compared to China.As of the end of 2022, the ratio of new energy vehicles to charging stations in China was about 2.6:1, meaning that 2.6 new energy vehicles could share one charging station.Due to the strong demand from overseas markets, many Chinese-listed companies in the charging station business have disclosed their layout in overseas markets in 2022.""Currently, the new regulations in the United States do not have much impact on domestic charging station companies because the number of charging stations exported to the United States by domestic companies is relatively small,"" said a manager of a charging station production company to the reporter of Yicai.com.Daotong Technology said the regulation will have a relatively small impact on the company, as it has taken the policy´s impact into account when formulating its 2023 sales targets. In response to the policy requirements, the company is planning to build a factory in the United States, which is expected to be established and put into operation by the end of 2023.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0217/c90000-10209411.html,17,2,2023,uk,pdo
Sunak set to take over as UK's next PM - People's Daily Online,"Sunak set to take over as UK´s next PM (Xinhua) 09:26, October 25, 2022LONDON, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Rishi Sunak, former chancellor of the exchequer of the United Kingdom (UK), on Monday won the ruling Conservative Party´s leadership contest. He will replace Liz Truss as the country´s new prime minister.Sunak was the only contender who secured the required backing of 100 lawmakers by the deadline of 2 p.m. local time, thus becoming the winner automatically. Another contender, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons, failed to garner enough votes.Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson withdrew from the contest on Sunday night, despite claiming that he had secured the backing of 102 Tory lawmakers. Johnson said it was ""simply not the right time"" for him to stand for the leadership race as ""you can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in Parliament.""The leadership race was triggered when Truss announced her resignation on Thursday after a little over six weeks in office. Her economic blueprint, the ""mini-budget,"" was blamed for causing economic chaos and tanking the Conservative Party´s poll rating.In Sunak´s first shot at the top job this summer, he lost to Truss in the head-to-head stage of the Tory leadership race, triggered then by scandal-hit Johnson´s resignation.Sunak, 42, is the first person of Indian origin to become UK prime minister.He inherits an economy that is on the brink of recession as a combination of energy crisis, cost-of-living crisis and runaway inflation defies any easy fix.His predecessor´s solution of debt-funded tax cuts failed to turn the situation around. Truss´s economic strategy plunged the British pound to a 37-year low against the U.S. dollar, while pushing up the cost of government borrowing and mortgage rates.In his first public address as the Tory leader, Sunak said: ""There is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge. We now need stability and unity. And I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.""The opposition parties, including the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, have all swiftly renewed their calls for a general election, arguing that the country´s people should have a say over who lead the country instead of only the Tory party members calling the shot.Sunak is expected to meet King Charles III in Buckingham Palace, where the monarch will invite him to form a government, though when the meeting will take place remains unknown. Truss' spokesperson said there won't be a handover to Sunak on Monday.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1025/c90000-10163084.html,25,10,2022,uk,pdo

He lived between 701 and 762, also a golden age of Chinese poetry, and his poems are brimful of patriotism and romanticism.Gu´s generation´s relay of guarding the tomb serves as a great testimony to Li Bai´s famous verse on good faith, ""Hai Yue Shang Ke Qing, Tu Nuo Zhong Bu Yi."" The words simply mean that even if the oceans dry up and mountains fall apart, the promise made remains unchangeable.Chinese people have long cherished good faith as one of their top values and essential virtues in life and pursued harmony.In Dangtu County, the locals' good faith has brought them more than a good reputation but also tangible benefits.In August 2019, the county launched a pilot credit rating program in the townships of Wuxi and Huhei, which can grant the villagers low-interest unsecured loans via cooperation with local banks.Based on solid evidence and cautious ratings on personal performances, Shi Hailin in Qifang Village received a total of 600,000 yuan (about 84,200 U.S. dollars) of loans via the program to buy raw materials, upgrade equipment and expand his crab farming business.Shi´s good faith was proven by daily good acts, including keeping promises, active participation in social welfare activities, respecting the elderly, and caring for the young.Different from the conventional credit rating system, the county´s programs advocate more good faith embodied in one´s daily performances.

China opposes IAEA using budget for AUKUS-related safeguards activities - People's Daily Online,"China opposes IAEA using budget for AUKUS-related safeguards activities (Xinhua) 11:14, November 19, 2022VIENNA, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- China is opposed to using the budget of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for safeguards activities related to nuclear submarine cooperation under the AUKUS, which is ""a sheer act of nuclear proliferation,"" a Chinese envoy said here on Friday.Wang Qun, China´s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Vienna, said at a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors that the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation represents a serious non-proliferation challenge facing the international community and must be addressed properly.In September 2021, the United States (U.S.), the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia established the AUKUS alliance, under which the U.S. and the UK will assist Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. China and many other countries have repeatedly expressed concerns over the transfer of nuclear weapon materials involved in the trilateral pact.Wang said that three principles are essential to address the challenge posed by the AUKUS -- the IAEA´s non-proliferation mandate and political orientation must be upheld; an intergovernmental review and consultation process driven by IAEA member states must be upheld to address the safeguards issues for the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation; and the safeguards arrangements for the AUKUS cooperation must be worked out through a consensus-based approach.The IAEA secretariat can only make the corresponding safeguards arrangements with Australia as mandated by the agency´s member states and does not have the authority to make decisions on its own, Wang added.The Chinese envoy stressed that if the AUKUS countries and the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi try to negotiate any safeguards arrangement without consensus among the agency´s member states, such arrangement will carry no validity and will severely undermine the IAEA´s unity and credibility, paralyze its functions and threaten the effectiveness and integrity of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) and the international non-proliferation regime.Wang called on the AUKUS countries to return to compliance with the international non-proliferation regime and urged Grossi to effectively perform his duties and act in strict accordance with the IAEA Statute and the mandate given to him by its member states.He also called on all IAEA member states to jointly safeguard the NPT and the international non-proliferation regime. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1119/c90000-10173706.html,19,11,2022,uk,pdo

This technology will reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution.""""Our goal is to offset all greenhouse gas emissions, while advancing low-carbon solutions in Qatar,"" the organizers said.The goal also has a lot to do with Qatar´s vision that by 2030 the country will become capable of sustaining its development and providing a high standard of living for its people.Yutong said it is building a knockdown plant in Qatar to facilitate the country´s campaign. The plant is expected to become operational in November 2023.Besides Qatar, Yutong is exporting its electric vehicles to several countries, including France, the United Kingdom and Norway, as the world shifts toward emissions-free transportation.The bus maker is one of the Chinese vehicle companies that are drawing attention at global events.A total of 300 Air EVs made by China´s Wuling served as shuttle vehicles at the 17th Group of 20 or G20 Summit held last week in Bali, Indonesia.Other electric vehicles used during the summit were from South Korea´s Hyundai and Japan´s Toyota.The Wuling Air EVs were made at Wuling´s Bekasi production base in West Java, Indonesia.Xu Haidong, vice-chief engineer of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said Chinese companies are competitive globally in terms of new energy vehicles, as China has an early-mover advantage in the segment and China´s huge market has stimulated companies to improve their products.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1121/c90000-10174191.html,21,11,2022,uk,pdo

Nation's modernization both challenging and significant - People's Daily Online,"Nation´s modernization both challenging and significantBy Zheng Gongcheng (China Daily) 09:21, October 31, 2022In the report delivered to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that China´s modernization is ""a task of unparalleled difficulty and complexity"", as it entails the modernization of a population that is larger than the combined population of all developed countries. Its difficulty and complexity can be seen from at least two perspectives.First, from a historical perspective, modernization is a developed social form characterized by industrialization, urbanization and profound changes in the economy, society, politics and culture.So far, the current trend of modernization of human society has been going on for over 200 years. In the second half of the 18th century, when the United Kingdom started its industrialization, it had an estimated population of 8 million people. In the 20th century, when the United States led global modernization, its population grew from 100 million in 1910 to more than 300 million in 2007.China must complete its modernization process with a population of over 1.4 billion, which would be the most remarkable modernization in the history of human development.Second, from a realistic perspective, China is the world´s most populous country and the largest developing country.According to population data this year, China´s population accounts for about 18 percent of the total global population. The nation´s population is 4.26 times that of the US, 3.16 times that of the European Union, 9.75 times that of Russia, and 11.21 times that of Japan. China´s population is over 1.5 times the total population of the countries and regions that have completed modernization.The modernization of a country with such a huge population will completely rewrite the landscape of global modernization. By that time, the center of global modernization will no longer be Europe and North America, but China or modern Asia and modern East Asia with China as the mainstay. It is an inevitable outcome of major changes underway in the global landscape.The modernization of its huge population is significant for both China and the world.In terms of the implications for China, its modernization seeks common prosperity and thus is a process that will benefit all of the people. It took only decades for the Chinese people, under the leadership of the CPC and through their own unremitting efforts, to complete the nation´s industrialization process — a process that took developed countries over 200 years.The nation has managed to lift nearly 100 million rural residents out of extreme poverty over the past decade with a campaign that brought an end to regional and overall poverty. With the overall living standards of urban and rural residents being lifted to a higher level, China has succeeded in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, laying a solid foundation for the realization of its modernization.Being able to move toward modernization in a developing country with such a huge population fully demonstrates the strength of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. This strength has been transformed into the efficiency of national governance, which in turn has been transformed into a huge development achievement in the process of national modernization.Therefore, the modernization of a huge population and common prosperity will offer not only the best example of the strength in China´s system, but also the best example for a new form of human civilization created by the Chinese path to modernization.In terms of its significance for the world, the modernization of a country or region with a small population will not be as significant as the modernization of a country with a large population. The modernization of the UK, Germany and the US has exerted important influences and played high exemplary roles in the world.As a developing country with a huge population, China started as a poor country. Through arduous exploration and hard work, the nation has followed a path of modernization that is different from that of the developed countries in the West.Since the founding of the People´s Republic of China, the nation´s successful practice in continuously improving public wellbeing, and its modernization drive toward common prosperity, have demonstrated that the modernization of Western capitalist countries is not the only modernization path. In doing so, China has blazed a new path for developing countries to move toward modernization, and provided new options for nations wishing to accelerate their development and maintain their independence and autonomy. Therefore, the contribution of Chinese modernization to human modernization is brand new at the institutional level.It should be pointed out that, with its huge population, China´s modernization will be an arduous and complex process. As General Secretary Xi pointed out, ""Our modernization is both the most difficult and the greatest.""Therefore, it is important to maintain a sober mind going forward and adopt a problem-oriented approach focusing on the goals already established. The successful convening of the 20th CPC National Congress marks the beginning of the next stage of China´s journey as it strives to become a modern socialist country in all respects.As long as we uphold the leadership of the CPC and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and make steady progress toward the established goals in accordance with strategic plans, the blueprint for the Chinese path to modernization and common prosperity for over 1.4 billion people will surely become a reality.The author is a professor at Renmin University of China and head of the China Association of Social Security.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1031/c90000-10165231.html,31,10,2022,uk,pdo
Interview: China's path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist - People's Daily Online,"Interview: China´s path to modernization congruent with its culture: renowned British sociologist (Xinhua) 11:56, March 11, 2023LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China has blazed a path to modernization that suits its society and harmonizes with the environment, a renowned British sociologist has said.""There are two things (about the Chinese path to modernization) which stand out for me: the scale of the task with such a large population on one side, harmony with nature on the other,"" Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.Albrow said that, given the sheer size of China´s population, the amazing pace of its modernization has greatly impressed him.Harmony between humanity and nature is a theme that goes back millennia into Chinese history, the sociologist said. ""It shows that the emphasis China gives to that means that modernization does not discard the past; it adopts the past and carries the past forward.""""Modernization is congruent with the culture of China itself,"" Albrow said.The Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development, he said.Albrow explained that modernization means applying science and technology to human organizations.""On the back of the development of modern technologies, modernization allows countries to take their own culture forward,"" he said. ""Every country is able to develop modernity in the way that suits its own culture.""""China has given an example to the world of how you can have a culturally-led modernization program,"" he added.Albrow, author of the book China and the Shared Human Future: Exploring Common Values and Goals, said that as the world turns its attention to the ongoing ""two sessions"" held in Beijing, it´s important for China to demonstrate that ""democracy comes in many different forms"" and that ""China is moving forward all the time.""The ""two sessions"" refer to the annual meetings of the National People´s Congress, the country´s national legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body.""The Chinese version of democracy is one which enlists the support of the whole population, through the efforts of the Communist Party of China to produce a coherent approach to the rest of the world,"" he said. ""China´s form of democracy is an evolving form of discussion and debate, but one which is built upon the consensus of society as a whole.""""It´s a profound kind of democracy and very different from the kinds which exist in so many Western countries, the kinds of democracies that exist, for instance, (in) the United Kingdom or the United States, ones which tend to produce disagreements"" and make it difficult for a country to take any single path into the future, despite its continual debate and discussion about how to go forward, according to Albrow.""Democracy is not a stable condition; democracy is something which is continually moving forward,"" he continued, adding that ""China is in a position now, in this particular 'two sessions', to take us forward again, with well-judged reforms of its own system.""Albrow is confident in the CPC´s resolve to further reforms that will remove institutional obstacles to fulfill Chinese modernization. Over the past decades, the CPC has shown the courage to develop and introduce changes and reforms, he said. ""I have no reason to think it can't do it in the future."" ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0311/c90000-10220509.html,11,3,2023,uk,pdo

OU DONGQU/XINHUAIn the past 12 months, Chinese experts provided the impetus for many discoveries.Zhang Zhihao reports.Fostering quality scientific talent, employing innovation to serve the country´s strategic needs and achieving major milestones in research capacities were last year´s highlights for China´s science and technology sector.Science and technology underpinned many of the nation´s biggest achievements, including hosting the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, finding new engines for socioeconomic growth and completing construction of the Tiangong Space Station.Last year, the country climbed one place to 11th out of 132 economies on the Global Innovation Ranking 2022, published by the World Intellectual Property Organization. China was the only middle-income economy to make it into the top 20.The country topped nine indicators out of the roughly 80 criteria used by the list to measure innovation capacity, including: domestic market size; the number of companies offering formal training; patients by origin; growth of labor productivity; trademarks by origin; industrial designs by origin; and exports of creative goods.For the first time, China had as many top 100 science and technology clusters as the United States, with 21 apiece, according to WIPO.Meanwhile, Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou was the world´s second-most innovative sci-tech cluster, with Beijing in third place.Speaking via a video address to the publication ceremony of the Global Innovation Ranking 2022 in September, Wang Zhigang, minister of science and technology, said that over the past decade, China´s science and technology sector has seen historic and profound changes. ""China has been a key participant in global frontier science, technology and innovation, as well as a key contributor to jointly solving global challenges,"" he said.He added that China will facilitate opening-up and international cooperation, actively integrate into the global innovation network and foster bigger and deeper collaboration in science and technology.In an article published last month, Hou Jianguo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that a country´s research capability in basic sciences is the foundation for supporting innovation and the basis of China´s pursuit of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency in science and technology.The academy will help optimize policies to support scientific research and regulations on cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology, he said, noting that it will also build a more effective innovation mechanism, nurture world-class scientists and promote open sciences and international cooperation.【1】【2】【3】",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0103/c90000-10191270.html,03,1,2023,uk,pdo

This will allow them to not only meet Ukraine´s needs on the frontline but also to replenish the NATO and EU member states' ammunition stockpiles.Since the consumption rate of ammunition is greater than the production rate, the EU and NATO member states need to ramp up production, Stoltenberg and Borrell said. Efforts to ramp up production started at the end of last summer, according to Kuleba.NATO will help Ukraine develop a procurement system that is effective, transparent and accountable, Stoltenberg said. The alliance will also increase its targets for ammunition stockpiles through its Defense Planning Process.Stoltenberg said he regretted Russia´s decision to suspend its participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States, which was announced earlier on Tuesday by Russia´s President Vladimir Putin.Russia suspends participation in New START rather than withdraws from it, Putin said.In early February, NATO called on Russia to ""return to full compliance"" with New START and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. That ""sounds like some kind of nonsense amid today´s confrontation,"" Putin said in his annual address to Russia´s Federal Assembly.He pointed to the combined strike potential of NATO as the United Kingdom and France also have nuclear arsenals that pose a threat to Russia.Moscow said it had information that ""certain figures in Washington"" are considering conducting tests to develop new types of nuclear weapons. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0222/c90000-10211233.html,22,2,2023,uk,pdo

(Xinhua/Zhou Mu)China had detected 24 imported cases of the new Omicron variant CH.1.1 and its offshoots as of Monday. However, the strain is not expected to spark widespread transmission in the short term, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.No domestic cases of the strain have been reported so far, China CDC said in a statement released on Tuesday.CH.1.1 is a descendant of BA.2.75, an Omicron subvariant that was first reported in India in July. It is now responsible for about 25 percent of infections in the United Kingdom and has also spread quickly in Denmark and Singapore.The variant features multiple mutations that enhance its ability to evade immunity, including a mutation seen in the more deadly Delta variant. However, there is no evidence pointing to stronger pathogenicity.The majority of people in China have high levels of neutralizing antibodies that can protect them against CH.1.1, China CDC said.""In the short term, CH.1.1 will not trigger large-scale outbreaks,"" it said, adding that people age 65 and older, those with preexisting illnesses and unvaccinated people should maintain personal protection.China is nearing the end of the current outbreak, with BF.7 and BA.5.2 remaining the dominant strains, health officials said recently.Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at China CDC, said the nation has established basic herd immunity against COVID-19.In an interview with People´s Daily on Wednesday, he said 80 to 90 percent of people in China have acquired immunity from recent infections. That figure, coupled with vaccination coverage hitting 90 percent, means that herd immunity has been established in a basic form.""In the short term, the epidemic situation is safe, and the thunderstorms have passed,"" he said.In the long run, many uncertainties remain, such as the threat from emerging imported strains and the risk facing unvaccinated elderly people, Zeng said.By Jan 20, the Chinese mainland had administered nearly 3.5 billion doses of vaccines and fully vaccinated 90.5 percent of its total population, official data shows.Wang Quanyi, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said on Tuesday that the Chinese capital has built temporary herd immunity and the risk of another COVID wave in the next three months is small.He suggested that unvaccinated people age 80 and above seize the window of opportunity and get inoculated.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0202/c90000-10202240.html,02,2,2023,uk,pdo

"UK hit by waves of labor action over pay, conditions - People's Daily Online","UK hit by waves of labor action over pay, conditions (Xinhua) 10:37, November 26, 2022LONDON, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Recurring strikes by nurses, university staff and postal workers, among others, have caused chaos in the United Kingdom (UK) in November and the coming months are likely to bring further disputes over pay.NURSES TO WALK OUTThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said on Friday its members are set to stage a national walkout, the first in the organization´s 106-year history, in mid-December to demand more pay, and said that further days of strike action may also be announced later.""Nursing staff have had enough of being taken for granted, enough of low pay and unsafe staffing levels, enough of not being able to give our patients the care they deserve,"" RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen said in a statement.An analysis published by the London Economics consultancy in October found that the salaries of experienced nurses have declined by 20 percent in real terms over the last 10 years in most of the UK. The RCN is campaigning for a 5 percent pay rise that is 5 percent above the rate of inflation.The RCN is ""demanding a massive pay rise of 17.6 percent--an increase around three times the average settlement that millions of hardworking people outside the public sector are getting,"" Health Secretary Steve Barclay tweeted on Friday.""Inevitably strike action will have an impact on services,"" he added, noting that the government remains open to talks.MORE STRIKES UNDERWAYMore than 70,000 staff at 150 universities across the UK began three days of strike action on Thursday over pay, working conditions and pensions. The University and College Union (UCU) said the strike is the biggest in the history of higher education and that over 2.5 million students could be impacted.The union´s demands include ""a meaningful pay rise to deal with the cost-of-living crisis as well as action to end the use of insecure contracts and deal with dangerously high workloads.""The Communication Workers Union (CWU), Royal Mail´s biggest labor union, went on strike on Thursday and Friday after it had failed to reach an agreement with the postal service and courier company. The walkouts coincided with the Black Friday sales.""Our members are striking for a pay rise that fully addresses the current cost of living,"" the CWU said. When Royal Mail workers walked out in late October, the union said the total number of days lost to industrial action in 2022 in CWU strikes had reached 1.25 million.The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) also announced on Tuesday a series of 48-hour strikes in December and January involving more than 40,000 members after the union and industry bosses failed to reach a settlement.This latest round of labor action ""will send a clear message that we want a good deal on job security, pay and conditions for our people,"" RMT General Secretary Mick Lynch said.RISING COST OF LIVINGStrikes have swept across the UK in the past months. In September, there were 205,000 working days lost to labor disputes in the country, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Pay disputes have intensified amid the rising cost of living. The UK´s consumer price index (CPI) rose by 11.1 percent in the 12 months to October, up from 10.1 percent in September, hitting a fresh 41-year high. Rising energy and food costs have more bearing on the inflation rate experienced by low-income households.After taking inflation into account, average total pay (including bonuses) fell by 2.6 percent and regular pay (excluding bonuses) fell by 2.7 percent between July and September, the ONS said. This was among the largest falls in growth since comparable records began in 2001.""Pay growth continues to strengthen in the private sector. This has driven a huge wedge between private and public sector pay, which has been subject to very tight settlements,"" Louise Murphy, an economist at the think tank Resolution Foundation, said.""This wedge is unsustainable in the long run as it creates huge difficulties for recruiting and retaining the public sector,"" she said.The walkouts have taken a huge economic toll and had a huge impact on day-to-day life. Economists have assessed that the first wave of rail strikes alone, in June 2022, cost the UK economy nearly 100 million British pounds (121 million U.S. dollars), according to a government report.

"Interview: Some UK households face ""heat or eat"" dilemma, says scholar - People's Daily Online","Interview: Some UK households face ""heat or eat"" dilemma, says scholar (Xinhua) 13:26, December 22, 2022LONDON, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- Facing the combined effects of sub-zero temperatures and increasing prices, some families across the United Kingdom (UK) have to juggle their incomes between staying warm or buying food, a Glasgow Caledonian University research fellow told Xinhua. Simply put, their choice is between heat or eat.Many in the country had already been in a rather tight financial position before the cold weather set in, Dr. Keith Baker said.Last week was a particularly cold one across the UK, with snow, ice and fog warnings in several places. Dec. 12 was the coldest day in the UK since December 2010, the Met Office said.As a scholar, Baker has worked with groups seeking to help people faced with the dual problem of a cost-of-living crisis and high energy bills. ""People really are on the line between just and only just about surviving and being pushed into really quite deplorable situations.""Inflation has been running high in the UK since last winter, reaching successive new records. In November, the UK´s consumer price index (CPI) rose by 10.7 percent. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increased by 16.5 percent in that month.""We don't know how high some food prices are going to rise. Barely a day goes by before you see that the price of one type of food is going up, next day the price of another type of food is going up,"" Baker said, adding that this level of uncertainty is detrimental to mental health.Inflation is being driven mainly by soaring energy prices. In October, UK households paid 88.9 percent more on average for electricity, gas and other fuels than a year ago, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Domestic gas prices in October were more than double that a year earlier.People have suffered substantially with their bills going up, Baker said. ""Energy bills will go up to about 2,600 British pounds (3,146 U.S. dollars) on average, and I stress that´s average, rising again to 3,000 pounds as of April.""""We've now got to the point where charities are trying to get out warm clothing to people.""Public libraries and community centers across the UK have thrown open their doors to people eager to escape the cold in their homes, offering warm drinks and hot soup.Acknowledging that the government support offered by newly installed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt may go some way to help families on welfare benefits, Baker has called for more.""A lot of households are already in the position of no heat and less to eat, and I really wish politicians would get it through their heads that some householders are really in a dire situation.""

"UK chancellor announces tax hikes, spending cuts to restore finances - People's Daily Online","UK chancellor announces tax hikes, spending cuts to restore finances (Xinhua) 10:13, November 18, 2022Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt of the United Kingdom (UK) leaves 11 Downing Street in London, Britain, on Nov. 17, 2022. (Xinhua)LONDON, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt of the United Kingdom (UK) on Thursday announced a package of tax hikes and spending cuts worth 55 billion British pounds (65 billion U.S. dollars) in a bid to improve the public finances and restore the country´s economic credibility.FISCAL SQUEEZE""Today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and rebuild our economy,"" Hunt told the House of Commons in his Autumn Statement 2022. ""Our priorities are stability, growth and public services.""To raise further funds, the threshold at which higher earners start to pay the top 45 percent rate will be reduced from 150,000 pounds to 125,140 pounds, while the income tax, inheritance tax and national insurance thresholds will be frozen for a further two years until April 2028, according to the chancellor.To ensure that businesses making extraordinary profits due to the high energy prices also pay their fair share, the windfall tax on oil and gas companies will increase from 25 percent to 35 percent, with the levy remaining in place until March 2028, and a new, temporary 45 percent levy will be introduced for electricity generators.On public spending, according to the statement, departments will be expected to work more efficiently and support the government´s mission of fiscal discipline. From 2025-2026 onwards, day-to-day spending will increase more slowly by 1 percent above inflation.Amid the cost-of-living crisis, the chancellor unveiled another support package. While the government is capping typical energy bills for households this winter at 2,500 pounds, the Energy Price Guarantee will continue to provide support from April 2023 with the cap rising to 3,000 pounds. Households on means-tested benefits, pensioners and people on disability benefits will receive new payments.To ensure fiscal discipline, the chancellor also introduced two new fiscal rules: the country´s national debt must fall as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) by the fifth year of a rolling five-year period; and public sector borrowing in the same year must be below 3 percent of GDP.Overall, according to the government, the fiscal plan improves public finances by 55 billion pounds by 2027-2028.The budget squeeze comes after a large-scale package of unfunded tax cuts announced by the government in September threw financial markets into turmoil as the fiscal giveaway measures were expected to ramp up public borrowing and they dealt a huge blow to the country´s fiscal reputation.BLEAK OUTLOOK""The chancellor has stayed true to his word in focusing on financial stability and targeting support for the most vulnerable in society. But in the teeth of a recession, this statement will not increase business confidence,"" Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), commented.On Thursday, the fiscal watchdog Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said in its latest economic and fiscal outlook that rising prices would erode real wages and reduce living standards by 7 percent in total over the two financial years to 2023-2024, wiping out the previous eight years' growth, despite government support.The squeeze on real incomes, rise in interest rates and fall in house prices would all weigh on consumption and investment, tipping the economy into a recession lasting just over a year from the third quarter of 2022, with a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of 2 percent, it said.The OBR noted that the medium-term fiscal outlook has materially worsened since its March forecast due to a weaker economy, higher interest rates and higher inflation.Based on the policy as it stood in March, the OBR said, government borrowing would have been 108 billion pounds, or 3.7 percent of GDP, in 2027-2028 and underlying debt would have been rising every year.Many other forecasts have also depicted a bleak future. The Bank of England in early November said that if interest rates were to rise as much as the market expected, GDP would continue to fall throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024. Even without more rate hikes, the economy is still expected to be falling at the end of 2023.A monthly comparison of independent projections published by the UK Treasury on Wednesday showed an average new forecast of 4.2 percent for UK GDP growth in 2022 and 0.9-percent contraction in 2023.""Fiscal policy will be tightened materially next year, amplifying the recession already underway,"" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said.""Britain´s recession likely will be the deepest among the major advanced economies, given that no other country has moved so soon to raise taxes and withdraw energy price support,"" Tombs added.

"Yearender: Fruitful cooperation in 2022 as China, Uganda celebrate six-decade ties - People's Daily Online","Yearender: Fruitful cooperation in 2022 as China, Uganda celebrate six-decade ties (Xinhua) 10:03, December 30, 2022KAMPALA, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- The year 2022 has been fruitful for China-Uganda cooperation as the two countries celebrated 60 years of diplomatic ties.A month into 2022, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), together with France´s TotalEnergies, announced the long-awaited 10-billion-U.S.-dollar Final Investment Decision, a blueprint plan to start commercial production of Uganda´s oil. This was a signal of the deepening ties between Uganda and China, dating back to Oct. 18, 1962, just nine days after the east African country attained political independence from the United Kingdom.At an event held at the national ceremonial ground, Kololo Independence Ground, Kampala, the capital of Uganda, on Feb. 1, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni told the country and the world that once the first oil starts flowing in 2025, the revenues would be used to fast-track the country´s economic development, especially in the transport and energy infrastructure sectors.Economic experts from entities including Uganda´s central bank, the Bank of Uganda, have argued that proper utilization of Uganda´s oil revenue will fast-track its economic development, pulling millions out of poverty.Months into 2022, drilling activities have started in the oil wells in the western part of the country on the shores of Lake Albert, shared with the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Chinese drilling experts together with their Ugandan experts are already at Kingfisher oilfield, which is owned by CNOOC. Works are also ongoing at Tilenga oil fields which are owned by TotalEnergies. A 1,445-km crude oil pipeline, estimated to cost 3.55 billion dollars, will be constructed to transport the oil to the international market through the Tanzanian seaport of Tanga. Uganda´s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development estimates that the oil project will generate about 160,000 jobs besides provisions of goods and services.The Chinese Embassy in Uganda this year also announced that as a follow-up of the nine cooperation programs announced at last year´s Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), it has together with the Ugandan government developed a pool of projects aimed at increasing household income. These projects include mushroom and bamboo growing at a commercial level, according to Zhang Lizhong, Chinese ambassador to Uganda.Also as a follow-up on the eighth ministerial FOCAC meeting, China this year extended up to 98 percent of Ugandan goods to access the Chinese market at zero tariffs, starting Dec. 1. China pledged to increase the scope of products enjoying zero tariff treatment for the least developed countries that have diplomatic ties with it in a bid to reach 300 billion U.S. dollars in total imports from Africa in the next three years.Uganda´s Minister for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives Francis Mwebesa, while speaking at the public unveiling of the Special Preferential Tariff Treatment of Ugandan Exports to China held in Kampala on Nov. 18, urged the business community to take advantage of the Chinese market access.""To export to China, it is the best market we can access, the private sector especially those in coffee should access the Chinese market,"" Mwebesa said.China has since 2010 been increasing the number of Ugandan goods that can access its market tariff-free. According to Uganda´s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperative, China in 2013 increased the zero tariff line to 95 percent from 60 percent in 2010. In 2015, the zero tariff line was further increased to 97 percent.The trade volume between the two countries in 2021 amounted to 1.07 billion dollars, registering a 28.5 percent increase, against the shock waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of 2020, China´s direct investment in Uganda reached 710 million dollars and the investment is mainly focused on manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and logistics.This year, China and Uganda also commemorated their 60th anniversary since the establishment of diplomatic ties. At a webinar held in September, organized by the Chinese People´s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), the Chinese Embassy in Uganda, and the Ugandan Embassy in China, speakers on both sides hailed the bilateral ties on international affairs.Vice President of CPAFFC Jiang Jiang said China supported African countries to fight imperialism and colonialism. Africa also supported China´s restoration of the lawful seat at the United Nations in 1971, signaling deep ties between the two sides.""African brothers have withstood tremendous pressure, carried China to the United Nations, and always firmly supported China in safeguarding its legitimate rights and interests and core interests on international occasions,"" Jiang said.Uganda´s Ambassador to China Oliver Wonekha said China has been playing a central role in building transport and energy infrastructure in Uganda. China is financing the expansion of the country´s Entebbe International Airport, the main gateway to the world. China also financed the construction of the Kampala-Entebbe expressway linking the national capital of Kampala to the airport. In the energy sector, China financed the construction of the Karuma Hydro Power Plant and Isimba Hydro Power Plant which helped address Uganda´s energy deficit, a major bottleneck to the country´s development, the ambassador said.A report issued this month titled ""Chinese Enterprises Social Responsibility Report 2022"" showed that Chinese enterprises in Uganda are deepening the people-to-people ties between local and Chinese communities through their corporate social responsibility work.The report, which sampled 21 out of 129 member enterprises of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Uganda, showed that the enterprises have supported local communities by providing medical camps, scholarships, knowledge and skills training, and renovation of schools, among others.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1230/c90000-10190197.html,30,12,2022,uk,pdo

(Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa)Humans have paid a high price because of these extreme weather events, with lives lost to the natural disasters.LONDON, Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- From scorching sun and drying rivers to devastating floods, another year of extreme weather gripped Europe in 2022, warning about the impact of climate change and sending a cautionary note that more human efforts are needed for a greener future.""LIVE PICTURE OF A WARMING WORLD""When a cold snap gripped Northern Europe in mid-December and snow, a rare occurrence, blanketed London, memories of the extreme summer heat still lingered. In July, the United Kingdom (UK) recorded its highest ever temperature. Hungary this year also endured its hottest summer since 1901.Amid the scorching heatwaves, natural disasters ensued. A wildfire caused by a lightning strike in June became the worst ever recorded in Spain. Several parts of Italy also saw wildfires, including a massive one that burned over 850 hectares of land and forced more than 1,000 residents to evacuate.In late August, Europe was experiencing its worst drought in at least 500 years, with almost two-thirds of the continent in a state of alert or warning. Water levels of the river Drava in eastern Croatia dropped to a historic low.Photo taken on Aug. 31, 2022 shows a drought-affected farm field in Staffordshire, Britain. (Photo by Jon Super/Xinhua)Floods have posed another threat. A storm hit the northern Adriatic port of Rijeka in Croatia in September, with the downpour flooding the city center and damaging buildings. Intense rains early this month in Portugal also led to disturbances to road traffic and flooding at Lisbon Airport.With the higher frequency of extreme weather events came increasing concerns over climate change. Temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average over the past 30 years, the highest of any continent in the world, a report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) showed in early November.As a result, Alpine glaciers lost 30 meters in ice thickness from 1997 to 2021, and the Greenland ice sheet is melting and contributing to accelerating sea level rise, the report said.""Europe presents a live picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from impacts of extreme weather events,"" WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said.A car moves in flood water after heavy rain in Brod na Kupi, Croatia, Sept. 29, 2022. (Goran Kovacic/PIXSELL via Xinhua)HUGE LOSSESHumans have paid a high price because of these extreme weather events, with lives lost to the natural disasters. During the five heat periods this summer, the estimated excess mortality in England was 2,803 for those aged 65 and over, the highest since the introduction of a heatwave plan in 2004.In Spain, this summer was not only the hottest on record, but also the deadliest in 20 years, as thousands of people have died from heat-related causes on top of the high death toll associated with COVID-19.""Most at risk are the very young and the very old or those with a chronic illness that prevents them from hydrating themselves or those who are unable to avoid the heat,"" Emilio Salgado, senior specialist in the Emergency Department of Barcelona´s Hospital Clinic, told Xinhua.The deadliest extreme climate events in Europe are heatwaves, particularly in Western and Southern Europe, the WMO explained. ""The combination of climate change, urbanization and population ageing in the region creates, and will further exacerbate, vulnerability to heat,"" it said.A woman refreshes herself with the water from a fountain at Piazza del Popolo in Rome, Italy on Aug. 5, 2022. (Photo by Alberto Lingria/Xinhua)Pressure has been piling on the economy. Public transport was disrupted across the UK amid heatwaves. Severe droughts undermined supply chains on waterways in Germany. In France, wine production suffered in quantity and quality, while Italy saw agricultural production slashed.Climate-related events, including heatwaves, floods and storms, have caused over 145 billion euros (154.2 billion U.S. dollars) in economic losses in the European Union (EU) over the past decade, the bloc´s statistical office Eurostat said in late October.The highest total loss was recorded in 2017, reaching 27.9 billion euros, because of the heatwaves registered in Europe that dried the land and caused wildfires, Eurostat added.A thermometer shows 41 degrees Celsius in front of a building in Bucharest, capital of Romania, July 24, 2022. (Photo by Cristian Cristel/Xinhua)DOUBLE STANDARDSThe prolonged energy crisis has distracted Europe from its green goals, as many countries considered turning back to coal to secure energy supplies. Germany, Austria, Poland, the Netherlands and Greece were among the first to reopen coal power plants or take measures to support coal power.Europe´s thermal coal imports through November jumped by 36.2 percent from the same period in 2021 to roughly 83 million tonnes, a Reuters columnist quoted ship-tracking data from Kpler as saying in a December article.This summer, the European Parliament also voted in favor of plans to award a green investment label to nuclear and gas projects, sparking claims of ""greenwashing"" by some EU member states and environmental lobbyists.Photo taken on Sept. 10, 2022 shows a household gas stove in Haarlem, the Netherlands. (Photo by Sylvia Lederer/Xinhua)""European countries, which have been the chief beneficiaries of carbon pollution, are taking deliberate energy policy that clearly impinges on environmental protection aspirations. It is a demonstration of double standards,"" Kenya-based international relations scholar Cavince Adhere said.In early December, the UK government also approved the country´s first new coal mine in three decades, largely for steelmaking. Despite an official endorsement that the mine seeks to be net zero in its operations and contribute to local employment, criticism mounted over its lasting environmental impact.The coal mine will release some 250 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next 30 years, according to Myles Allen, professor of geosystem sciences at the University of Oxford.A train passes a thermal power plant in Berlin, Germany, Sept. 8, 2022. (Xinhua/Ren Pengfei)Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate change economics and policy at the University of Oxford, emphasized the difference between a short-term increase in fossil fuel use in response to the energy crisis, and new long-term investment in a coal mine.The decision to approve the mine sends a completely wrong message about the UK´s commitment to net zero, Fankhauser said. ""It looks hypocritical in the eyes of low-income countries, whose own fossil fuel ambitions we have repeatedly criticized.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1226/c90000-10188211.html,26,12,2022,uk,pdo

US-led West's pandemic trick won't succeed - People's Daily Online,"US-led West´s pandemic trick won't succeedBy Mahesh Pathak (China Daily) 10:44, January 19, 2023Luo Jie | China DailyRight from the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been stigmatized by some Western countries, especially the United States, with many people of Chinese origin becoming the target of hate crimes.Hate-mongers in some Western countries, the US in particular, used the pandemic as an excuse to target people of Asian, especially Chinese, origin. They blamed people of Asian origin for the spread of the novel coronavirus. Worse, previous US president Donald Trump played a key role in increasing racist attacks by labeling the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"".""People first"" has remained at the core of China´s COVID-19 response over the past three years, during which the virus mutated many times and the pandemic situation got from bad to worse before improving. Yet the worsening pandemic situation also spurred different governments and pharmaceutical companies to invest more resources and use more scientific minds to develop vaccines and prescribe the treatment for COVID-19 patients. As for China, the pandemic not only prompted it to develop COVID-19 vaccines but also provide free vaccination for all Chinese citizens.But with China lifting almost all anti-pandemic restrictions on Jan 8, some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, reintroduced compulsory pre-flight COVID-19 tests for Chinese visitors, while countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Italy, now require Chinese visitors to undergo COVID-19 tests on arrival and quarantine if they test positive.The World Health Organization has said that it is very concerned about reports of rising number of severe cases in China after the country abandoned the dynamic clearing COVID-19 policy.Most countries have not announced new entry requirements for Chinese visitors, and a select few have ruled them out entirely, including Poland and Bulgaria which refused to toe the European Union´s line on entry requirements for Chinese visitors.The US has made it mandatory for Chinese visitors to take an RT-PCR test less than 48 hours before boarding a flight and test negative to gain entry into the country from Jan 5. China fully opened its borders from Jan 8, welcoming visitors without mandatory quarantine and allowing Chinese citizens to travel abroad.At the Hong Kong airport, hundreds of people were recently seen waiting to check in for flights to cities on the Chinese mainland, but the arrivals hall was relatively quiet. Many of Hong Kong´s border checkpoints were fully opened, as were transportation halls and shuttered storefronts.Given the present situation, therefore, China may first normalize economic ties with some countries, including Belt and Road countries, before it does so with Western nations to establish a channel for the normal movement of people and goods.The Global North is also trying to reduce China´s expanding global presence in the fields of infrastructure and technology. For example, the G7 Summit in June 2022 launched a $600 billion fund to mobilize investment in global infrastructure projects as an answer to the Belt and Road Initiative. But the G7´s endeavor is a decade too late and short of billions of dollars, because the China-proposed initiative was launched in 2013 and completed or is working on projects worth more than $4 trillion.There are also presentation problems. The industrialized countries claim they are banding together to defend universal values, underpinning a liberal world order. But China and Russia argue that the industrialized countries are trying to rebuild a hierarchy based on imperialism and white supremacy. Opinion polls in the Global South show the arguments of Russia and China have found a receptive audience. Even within the Global North, many countries believe unilateral US actions are alienating some of their business partners. In fact, the US' restrictions on technology exports to China will deal another big blow to the biggest tech enterprises in the ROK, Japan and the EU.The Global North is also worried that China might end up controlling the technologies of the future and building what one senior US official said was ""a terrifying surveillance autocracy"" with a worldwide reach.To be sure, the pandemic has intensified the competition between China and the US, and the US has been badmouthing and stigmatizing China in the hope that it will help it emerge victorious in the competition. But that might not happen.The author is an independent expert in international relations based in Nepal.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0119/c90000-10198105.html,19,1,2023,uk,pdo
"Interview: Middle-earners to be worst hit by UK's new budget, says expert - People's Daily Online","Interview: Middle-earners to be worst hit by UK´s new budget, says expert (Xinhua) 09:49, November 24, 2022LONDON, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- Middle income earners in the United Kingdom (UK) will be the hardest hit by the government´s updated budget, a leading political expert told Xinhua.Commenting on the Autumn Statement delivered by Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt recently, Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science said the fiscal plan is a mix of measures for everyone but the middle classes will feel that the outcome is very negative for them.Last week, Hunt announced a package of tax hikes and spending cuts worth 55 billion British pounds (66.2 billion U.S. dollars). The government extended windfall taxes on energy companies' profits, froze the income tax, inheritance tax and national insurance thresholds, reduced the threshold of the top income tax rate and increased the minimum wage.""Those on lowish incomes will be brought into the tax bracket,"" Begg said. ""Those on the current lower rate of tax may well be brought into a higher rate of tax if they gain pay increases because the tax thresholds are being frozen. And that´s going to mean that those who are relatively prosperous will be paying more in tax simply because the thresholds have not been adjusted.""By freezing the tax thresholds and tax allowances, as Hunt has done, the government will drag more people into the tax net to generate more tax revenue, Begg explained.The updates to the country´s fiscal policies came against the backdrop of a worsening cost-of-living crisis. Inflation in the UK hit a 41-year high of 11.1 percent in October and people´s wage growth has failed to catch up with the soaring inflation.""People are already digging deeper into their pockets because of inflation. It means that your current income doesn't go as far as it used to,"" Begg said.""There were a number of measures that should at least prevent the worst off from being more badly hit than might have been feared,"" he said.According to Hunt, the National Living Wage (NLW) will rise to 10.42 pounds per hour from April 1, 2023, an increase of 92 pence or 9.7 percent.Also, while the government is currently capping typical energy bills for households this winter at 2,500 pounds, the Energy Price Guarantee will continue to provide support from April 2023 with the cap rising to 3,000 pounds. Households on means-tested benefits, pensioners and people on disability benefits will receive new payments.Hunt´s announcement came after a large-scale package of unfunded tax cuts announced by the previous government led by former Prime Minister Liz Truss in September threw financial markets into turmoil. The giveaway measures were expected to ramp up public borrowing, but they dealt a huge blow to the country´s fiscal reputation.

Villages adapt to changing times - People's Daily Online,"Villages adapt to changing timesBy YANG FEIYUE in Jiaxing, Zhejiang (China Daily) 09:07, October 26, 2022A bird´s-eye view of Xueshuigang village in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province. CHINA DAILYNew projects close the gap between rural and urban developmentIn his book Garden Cities of Tomorrow, Ebenezer Howard, an urban planner in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, supported the idea of combining active urban living with a pleasant rural environment.As China sets its sights on advancing rural vitalization in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) after eradicating the last traces of absolute poverty by the end of 2020, numerous villages nationwide have transformed themselves into places that Howard would have been happy to visit.In Jiaxing, Zhejiang province, villages have prospered by exploring distinctive ways to tap their potential.While baseball is commonly played in China, participation in the sport remains largely confined to major urban centers. However, in Xujiadai village, Zhejiang, home to some 5,000 residents, the sport is played every day.Professional baseball players have visited Xujiadai — which forms part of Pinghu, a county-level city in Jiaxing — to compete for prizes, while local children and farmers, as well as amateur players from urban areas, play the sport for fun in the village.Late last month Xu Hanwen, an 11-year-old from Xujiadai, completed a training session clad in a baseball strip, his white teeth contrasting with his tanned skin.""We played baseball for about four hours a day during the summer vacation,"" he said.Earlier this year, the boy and his teammates won a championship at a national youth baseball competition, and he was awarded the best hitter award.He was the envy of his young urban counterparts when they visited Xujiadai to experience baseball, which is expanding its presence in China.Well-equipped baseball facilities, ranging from grass fields to games rooms, have been introduced in Xujiadai.Xu is one of many local children who have received professional coaching in the sport for the past three years, with all costs covered by the village authorities in their efforts to boost the rural area.Liu Jianqun, a senior official in Xujiadai, which has a long history of traditional agriculture, said, ""You can tell from these children´s tans just how long they spend training outdoors.""When Liu took charge of development in the village in 2017, he aimed to set it on a particular course.""I used to play baseball, and saw how popular it is in a big city such as Shanghai, which is close to us,"" he said.After carrying out comprehensive research and analysis, Liu made the bold decision to develop baseball.""Villagers accepted our ideas, and even helped us make plans,"" Liu said. ""It was all hands on deck, and not only was the environment improved, but unity among local residents was enhanced.""Baseball players make full use of well-equipped facilities that have been introduced in Xujiadai, Jiaxing. CHINA DAILYIn 2018, the village authorities spent 8 million yuan ($1.15 million) on constructing the baseball facilities. A training area of more than 24,000 square meters is available for a total of 10 local primary and middle schools.In addition to holding physical exercise classes, professional coaches train players who are hoping some day to play baseball at international level.In recent years, Xujiadai has hosted a dozen baseball matches, including several at national level. It has also become a national baseball training venue for teenagers.Interest in the sport has drawn tourists to the area to try their hand at baseball and enjoy the scenic countryside.Farm parks and homestays have been developed to better meet travelers' needs, while businesses manufacturing baseball bags, caps and related cultural items are operating in Xujiadai.Fang Xi, who runs a private art gallery and a restaurant, said, ""I was immediately drawn to the countryside and decided to settle in the village.""Hailing from downtown Pinghu, Fang first visited Xujiadai in 2019, and invited her friends to play baseball with villagers. ""Baseball has been a great diversion for all of us,"" she said.Fang said her restaurant often caters to more than 100 guests during weekends, when the parking lot is full.More than 30 villagers have received dividends from shares in her business. ""This business mode is great, and I feel as though I genuinely fit in with the village,"" Fang said.The village authorities have launched a rural tourism company — encouraging locals to invest in this business, which has become a major source of income.""We give low-income households the first refusal on shares,"" Liu said.In recent years, the local economy has expanded annually by more than 50 percent, and the tourism company´s yearly business turnover exceeds 10 million yuan.Farmers in Jiaxing paint in their spare time. WANG GANG/CHINA NEWS SERVICEGala performersThe picturesque village of Zhongdai in Jiaxing is situated about 16 kilometers northwest of Xujiadai. Birds fly over gray-tiled, white-walled properties on the banks of a meandering river, while numerous visitors enjoy fishing at a pond.Early last month, as Liu Fang prepared food for weekend guests, she spoke fondly of a recent gala staged in Zhongdai, her home village.Hosted by China Central Television on Sept 3, the gala featured dancing and singing troupes, as well as 600 drones that lit up the sky above the village.The event was a rehearsal for and a prerecording of the Chinese Farmers Harvest Festival gala, which aired nationwide on Sept 23.Liu said: ""The gala was splendid. I received many orders after the event, especially with the National Day holiday just around the corner at the time.""She has run a rural catering business for many years, with turnover ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan a day during weekends and major holidays.""Now that the village has a nice environment, visitors from Shanghai, Hangzhou (capital of Zhejiang) and Jiaxing are arriving to see what it is like,"" Liu said.Zhongdai used to be one of the most economically backward areas of Jiaxing. In 2010, the village´s collective income was a little over 100,000 yuan.In 2013, the authorities in Zhongdai began eyeing an economy based on the logistics sector as the Pinghu Economic-Technological Development Zone in the neighborhood became a national-level zone.Yang Sijun, Zhongdai´s Party secretary, said properties in the village were transformed into factories. New properties were built to rent out, which over the years have produced a 10 percent return on investment.Zhongdai has also accelerated the transfer of land use to develop modern agriculture.Residents enjoy food at a community cultural event in the Pinghu Economic-Technological Development Zone, Zhejiang. CHINA DAILYLast year, the village netted more than 8 million yuan in recurring revenue — over six times the figure in 2012, according to the local authorities.The rising income enabled more infrastructure development and provided the village with a face-lift.A catering center launched in Zhongdai has hosted more than 60 events so far this year, earning revenue of 324,000 yuan.More agricultural and leisure tourism products have been introduced as a result of the progress made in the village.Over the years, many visitors to Zhongdai have headed for Cao Guijuan´s handmade rice wine workshop.Five years ago, Cao and her husband were persuaded by local officials to use their wine-making skills to open a business to attract visitors.""We have many patrons who keep returning to taste our rice wine,"" Cao said.One customer from Inner Mongolia autonomous region ordered 50 kilograms of rice wine in 2018 after tasting it in the village. Cao said that during Spring Festival last year, her business sold more than 1,000 kg of wine.Last year, Zhongdai received 150,000 traveler visits, with tourism income exceeding 30 million yuan, according to the local authorities.Yang said, ""By constructing a beautiful village, we are also actively developing homestays, agritainment and fruit-picking tours. We want to help villagers increase their income and become wealthy by growing the local economy to achieve common prosperity.""Workers replace traditional household stoves using firewood with e-stoves in Xueshuigang. CHINA DAILYVegetation restoredMeanwhile, dusty days are a thing of the past in Xueshuigang village, Haiyan county, Jiaxing, about an hour´s drive southwest of Zhongdai.Chen Yuliang, a senior official in the village, said, ""The hills surrounding Xueshuigang were mined one by one in pursuit of economic benefits, and the environment in the village was extremely bad.""In 2006, the local authorities closed the mines to restore vegetation damaged by the industry.Nine projects have been launched to restore Xueshuigang´s rustic charm. The village is also vigorously promoting the use of clean energy by installing photovoltaic street lamps and parking lots, along with charging posts for e-vehicles.Traditional household stoves using firewood have been replaced by e-stoves to reduce emissions of sulfoxides — organic compounds containing sulfur and oxygen.The vastly improved environment has attracted travelers and young entrepreneurs to Xueshuigang. Chen said, ""Our village has become an online sensation, attracting an increasing number of people.""Xueshuigang welcomed more than 210,000 visitors last year, earning tourism income of 6.42 million yuan, Chen added.Three years ago, Shu Hualun decided to set up his business in Xueshuigang, his home village, when he heard the local authorities were planning to develop an agricultural economic development zone.""The blueprint was very appealing to me,"" Shu said, adding that he made his decision after comparing local conditions with those in Shanghai and Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province.His company, Jiaxing Ronghe Agricultural Technology Co, specializes in organic fruit plantations, and its output value is expected to reach 8 million yuan this year, according to Shu.Cherry tomatoes are checked at a farm in Haiyan county, Zhejiang. CHINA DAILYSome 10 modern and highly efficient agricultural production projects such as Shu´s have been launched in Xueshuigang, creating job opportunities for more than 300 locals, including Cui Jinliang, who said, ""We have been able to make money right on our doorsteps.""Cui earns 4,000 yuan a month from working at a modern farm.Closing the gap between urban and rural development in Jiaxing has not only enriched villagers' lives but encouraged them, especially the younger generation, to set their sights high for the future.Back in Xujiadai, Xu, the 11-year-old, looked determined when asked if he would continue his intense baseball training in the village.""My parents have been supportive, and they play the sport in their spare time as well,"" he said, adding that baseball has enabled him to make friends nationwide.""I will try my best to be selected for the national team one day,"" he added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2022/1026/c90000-10163468.html,26,10,2022,uk,pdo
UN envoy calls for sustainable political settlement of Yemen crisis - People's Daily Online,"UN envoy calls for sustainable political settlement of Yemen crisis (Xinhua) 08:44, March 16, 2023The UN Security Council holds a meeting on Yemen at the UN headquarters in New York, on March 15, 2023. UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg on Wednesday called for efforts toward a nationwide cease-fire and a sustainable political settlement of the conflict. (Manuel Elias/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua)UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg on Wednesday called for efforts toward a nationwide cease-fire and a sustainable political settlement of the conflict.The overall military situation in Yemen continues to be relatively stable. Since a truce came into effect on April 2, 2022, Yemeni men and women have experienced almost a year of lower levels of violence, but ""this is fragile,"" said Grundberg.In a briefing to the Security Council, he expressed concerns about the uptick in the number and the intensity of clashes in several front-line areas, particularly the fronts in Marib and Taiz. ""I call on the parties to exercise maximum restraint during this critical time, including refraining from escalatory public rhetoric, to avoid destabilizing the situation.""In addition to the relative calm, elements of the truce continue to be implemented despite the fact that the truce has not been renewed lately. Thanks to the valuable support of Jordan, commercial flights continue to operate three times a week between Sanaa and Amman. Fuel ships continue to enter Hodeidah ports, along with other commodities, he noted.Yet, these gains are also fragile. And daily life remains a struggle for most Yemenis, he warned.The economic situation continues to be dire with the sadly familiar pattern of tit-for-tat economic retaliations, rather than cooperation. New restrictions hinder the freedom of movement of civilians, particularly women, and impede commercial traffic between different parts of the country. Yemenis' access to basic services remains limited, said Grundberg.""This underscores what I have stated almost one year ago: The truce can only be a stepping stone. We urgently need to build on what was achieved by the truce and work toward a nationwide cease-fire and an inclusive political settlement to end the conflict in Yemen.""Intense diplomatic efforts are ongoing at different levels to bring the conflict in Yemen to an end, he said.""We are currently witnessing renewed regional diplomatic momentum, as well as a step change in the scope and depth of the discussions. I welcome the continued efforts of regional member states, in particular, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman and ask the parties to seize the opportunities created by the regional momentum.""Grundberg also called on all sides to maintain a conducive environment for discussions and to allow the time and space needed for the discussions to bear fruit, warning that impatience at this juncture risks a return to a cycle of violence and risks unraveling what has been achieved so far.Short-term solutions and a piecemeal approach can only bring partial relief. A cease-fire and a sustainable political settlement can only be achieved through a more comprehensive approach, he said. ""The parties, as well as regional states, are clear that any understanding reached as part of the ongoing discussions must be translated into an intra-Yemeni agreement under UN auspices. A resumption of a political process is a central element in this regard and remains at the core of my mandate.""The political process must take into account the complexities of the conflict. It will be a difficult process that requires strong planning and a vision, backed by the commitment of the parties, he said.A political process that addresses the concerns and aspirations of the Yemeni people must be Yemeni-owned and inclusive. It must include the voices of a wide range of Yemeni stakeholders, including youth, civil society, and women, he added.Grundberg hailed the Chinese-brokered agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the restoration of diplomatic relations, saying the deal will have a positive impact on Yemen.""Allow me to also take this opportunity to welcome the recent agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran to resume diplomatic ties, which was facilitated by the People´s Republic of China. This dialogue and good neighborly relations are important for the region and for Yemen,"" he said.The parties must seize the opportunity presented by this regional and international momentum to take decisive steps toward a more peaceful future. This requires patience and a long-term perspective. And this requires courage and leadership. Much has been achieved over the past year and now is the time to take the next steps, he said.Yemen has been mired in a civil war since late 2014 when the Iran-backed Houthi militia stormed several northern cities and forced the Saudi-backed Yemeni government out of the capital Sanaa. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in the Yemeni conflict in 2015 to support the Yemeni government.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0316/c90000-10223115.html,16,3,2023,uk,pdo

[Photo/Xinhua]Vice-Premier Liu He met with United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Zurich, Switzerland, on Wednesday, for talks that were seen as improving bilateral relations while finding ways for China and the US to work together on tackling global challenges.Both countries agreed to enhance communication on macroeconomic and financial issues, according to a joint statement released after the talks. The statement described the first face-to-face meeting between the two as ""substantive, candid and pragmatic"".The two sides also agreed to increase cooperation on green finance on a bilateral and a multilateral basis, such as within the frameworks of the United Nations, the G20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the statement said.Yellen was invited to visit China this year, and the two sides agreed that their economic and trade teams will maintain communication at all levels.The meeting was a follow-up to the one between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia, in November, during which both leaders pledged to increase communication.Christopher Bovis, a professor of international business law at the University of Hull in the United Kingdom, said, ""The significance of the meeting between the Chinese vice-premier and the US treasury secretary is not to be underestimated.""""Face-to-face communication, in diplomatic terms, usually indicates the gravitas of the situation amidst the big picture of international developments and the thematics of the 2023 Davos economic forum,"" he said.Bovis said he believes the talks set the agenda that not only will dominate the Davos proceedings, but also project the parameters of current and future cooperation between the US and China, the world´s two largest economies.In a speech on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum´s annual meeting in Davos, Liu urged world leaders to abandon the ""Cold War mentality"" and reaffirmed China´s commitment to international cooperation and all-around opening-up, adding that ""China´s door to the outside will only open wider"".",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0119/c90000-10197944.html,19,1,2023,uk,pdo
