Pyongyang has previously referred to such exercises as a ‚Äúdress-rehearsal‚Äù for a full-scale invasion.The military drills, which are due to take place over the coming weeks, will feature computer-simulated responses to North Korean nuclear threats, as well as live-fire training and expanded field exercises.Pyongyang‚Äôs ballistic missile and nuclear programmes are outlawed under resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, but the North Korean leadership has maintained that weapons development is a necessary deterrent to oppose Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúhostile policies‚Äù.The North Korean military tested a record number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) last year, which it claims are capable of striking anywhere within the United States. The country also passed a law last year which authorizes the launch of pre-emptive nuclear strikes under certain conditions.

Cuba's leader Fidel Castro speaks on International Workers Day in Revolution Plaza in Havana, Cuba. ¬©                AP PhotoJavier GaleanoIn the immediate aftermath of the recent devastating earthquakes in T√ºrkiye and Syria, Cuba dispatched medical teams to the affected areas to provide care to victims.Their departure was marked by a farewell ceremony, which featured a large photo of Fidel Castro. It was quite appropriate, for the international medical solidarity which Cuba regularly extends to countries throughout the world is the brainchild of the late iconic leader himself, who, in 2003, proudly proclaimed that Cuba does not drop bombs on other countries but instead sends them doctors.Though Castro retired from his official duties as President of Cuba 15 years ago to the day, he has continued to remain a leader in solidarity and in peace. Cuban doctors were sent to more than 70 countries over the years, including nearly 40 different countries in 2020 to help in the fight against Covid-19. In 2010, even the New York Times acknowledged Cuba‚Äôs successful campaign against the cholera epidemic which broke out in Haiti after another earthquake. In 2014, the Times similarly gave credit to Cuba‚Äôs leadership in successfully fighting Ebola in Africa:‚ÄúCuba is an impoverished island that remains largely cut off from the world and lies about 4,500 miles from the West African nations where Ebola is spreading at an alarming rate. Yet, having pledged to deploy hundreds of medical professionals to the front lines of the pandemic, Cuba stands to play the most robust role among the nations seeking to contain the virus.Cuba‚Äôs contribution is doubtlessly meant at least in part to bolster its beleaguered international standing. Nonetheless, it should be lauded and emulated.‚ÄùIn addition, patients from 26 Latin American and Caribbean countries have traveled to Cuba to have their eyesight restored by Cuban doctors in what was dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Miracle.‚Äù Among them was Mario Teran, the Bolivian soldier who shot and killed Che Guevara.Read moreOnly one country backs US in UN Cuba voteIn 2014, Fidel received the Confucius Peace Award for his efforts in ending tensions with the United States and for his work to eliminate nuclear weapons.In addition, he played a key role in helping initiate, host and mediate the peace talks between the Colombian government and FARC guerillas which resulted in a peace deal in 2016, ending 52 years of brutal civil conflict.The historic role that Fidel Castro played was always outsized for a country as small as the island nation of Cuba, and as a result, his impact was felt beyond its borders. One of the first countries that Cuba aided, back in the early 1960s, was Algeria, which had recently won its independence from France.As described by Piero Gleijeses, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, in his book Conflicting Missions:It was an unusual gesture: an underdeveloped country tendering free aid to another in even more dire straits. It was offered at a time when the exodus of doctors from Cuba following the revolution had forced the government to stretch its resources while launching its domestic programs to increase mass access to health care. ‚ÄúIt was like a beggar offering his help, but we knew the Algerian people needed it even more than we did and that they deserved it,‚Äù [Cuban Minister of Public Health] Machado Ventura remarked. It was an act of solidarity that brought no tangible benefit and came at real material cost.This can be said of all of Cuba‚Äôs acts of international solidarity.                   Cuban doctors and nurses are bid farewell before leaving to Turkey to care for the victims of the earthquake, in Havana, on February 10, 2023.     ¬© YAMIL LAGE  AFP                                                        Meanwhile, what very few in the West know is that Cuba, under Fidel‚Äôs leadership and with the support of the USSR, played a key role in liberating southern Africa from US and apartheid-era South African domination, and in ultimately ending apartheid in the country itself. It was for this reason that the first nation Nelson Mandela visited after his release from prison was Cuba.While there, Mandela lauded the nation as ‚Äúa source of inspiration to all freedom-loving people.‚ÄùEven the Washington Postrecognized Fidel Castro as a hero of Africa.After the Chernobyl disaster of 1989, Cuba took in and treated 24,000 affected children.Many of these individuals and their families still live there to this day.This act of solidarity cannot be understated given the economic conditions in the island nation at the time.While Cuba benefited greatly from the support of the USSR and Eastern Bloc after its 1959 Revolution, which Fidel led, by 1989 the Communist governments had fallen and aid from the USSR itself, which would collapse in 1991, was drying up.As a result of all of this, Cuba would enter what it called its ‚ÄúSpecial Period,‚Äù a time of great economic deprivation which many believed would lead to the collapse of the Cuban Revolution as well.But Fidel and Cuba hung on, and they continued to extend help to people around the world even while they were having trouble feeding their own people.Read moreOn the edge of Armageddon? Why the Ukraine conflict is dangerously similar to the Cuban missile crisisDue to the intensification of US sanctions and the blockade of Cuba under President Donald Trump, and continued under President Biden, Cuba has now entered a time rivaling the ‚ÄúSpecial Period.‚ÄùEven before Trump‚Äôs tightening of the sanctions ‚Äì unrelenting US economic war against Cuba, described by Havana as ‚Äúgenocidal,‚Äù had cost the country an estimated $1.1 trillion in revenue and had denied the Cuban people ‚Äúlife-saving medicine, nutritious food, and vital agricultural equipment.‚ÄùDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the US even blocked delivery of critical medical aid, including masks and diagnostic equipment, to Cuba.The US is punishing Cuba and the Cuban people not for their shortcomings and failures, but because of their very successes.And amongst the successes of the Cuban Revolution which Fidel Castro led even after officially stepping down from power, is Cuba‚Äôs unequaled solidarity to the world.Fidel‚Äôs ‚Äúdoctors, not bombs‚Äù speech implicitly contrasted his country with the US, which is by far the world‚Äôs largest arms supplier while helping less and less with humanitarian aid.Indeed, US sanctions are directly standing in the way of humanitarian efforts in countries like Syria ‚Äì a country the US continues to economically strangle even in the face of the recent earthquake.Jose Marti, the Cuban revolutionary and poet who inspired Fidel Castro himself, once said that ‚Äúthere are two kinds of people in the world ‚Äì those who love and create, and those who hate and destroy.‚ÄùIt is evident that Cuba, continuously inspired by the ideas and example of Fidel, is of the former type.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571705-fidel-cuba-legacy-doctors/,2023,Feb,19

US attempts to ban TikTok are not about ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô ‚Äî RT World News,"        US attempts to ban TikTok are not about ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô                        Washington lawmakers have an aversion to anything coming out of China and attaining global success            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analyst¬©                Rafael HenriqueLightRocket via Getty ImagesTikTok is the most successful social media app to emerge in the past decade.A huge phenomenon among young people, TikTok has established itself as the single most downloaded application in the world,becoming a staplein many people‚Äôs lives in the same wayother platforms, such as Facebook, managed in the past.However, not everyone is happy. One unique characteristic of TikTok is that it‚Äôs the first non-American social media app to ever gain worldwide ascendancy. Even more importantly, it‚Äôs Chinese, and as much as the application isn‚Äôt political, its association with Beijing has landed it in the line of fire.A US House committee has just voted to forward an act which, if signed into law, will give the president power to ban TikTok as he wishes. Likewise, US President Joe Biden himself has ordered the application removed from all federally owned devices, a move which has been copied by some other Western countries.Read moreUS House committee votes on TikTok banThe claim is, because TikTok is ‚ÄúChinese-owned,‚Äù it must be a ‚Äúnational security risk.‚Äù The most hawkish US senators, such as Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, have never disguised their intentions to have it banned completely in the United States, and who can forget that the Trump administration already attempted to do so but was unsuccessful after the move waschallenged in court?Of course, there isn‚Äôt any serious evidence of a ‚Äúsecurity risk‚Äù posed by TikTok ‚Äì only guilt by association, since the app is Chinese. The firm has worked hard, and devotes enormous amounts of money to lobbying and marketing to prove the opposite. Apparently, that is not enough to stop the tide of paranoia sweeping in its direction.The reality? The US just isn‚Äôt rational when it comes to dealing with China. American political culture is deeply affected by ‚ÄòMcCarthyist‚Äô scaremongering, and when there are not enough solid facts available to justify an aggressive political decision, such decisions are made based on emotional statements. These emotional statements are most often related to fear or hatred, and trumped up as necessary to manufacture public consent. This is a ‚Äòpost-truth‚Äô world, and China is on the other side of it.Over the past few years, the US has developed an aversion to anything coming out of China that has attained global success. US foreign policy is now obsessed with trying to contain China at all costs, especially in the field of high-end technologies which, if Beijing is allowed to succeed, will enormously deplete US power and influence.The US has subsequently ‚Äúentity listed‚Äù or blacklisted thousands of Chinese companies. Recent measures include targeting Beijing‚Äôs entire semiconductor industry. This was after Washington set out to cripple Huawei. As the US pursues the Chinese companies it seeks to take down, it levels the same vague allegations at them, claiming that they are a ‚Äúnational security threat,‚Äù and that through their ‚Äúassociation‚Äù with the Chinese government, there is a risk that the technology will be used to take your data and spy on them.Read moreWhy is the Covid-19 lab leak theory back in the headlines?These allegations can get as silly as claiming Chinese-madefridges can spy on people. Never in this ‚Äòdebate‚Äô is any solid evidence ever provided. The US just simply says so again and again, until it becomes an established trope in popular discourse, is parroted by the mainstream media, and steers the public debate in allied countries to get the foreign policy outcomes that Washington wants. This is precisely how the US was able to convince allied countries to exclude Huawei from its 5G networks.However, it still remains unclear if the Biden administration will actually ban TikTok countrywide. First, it is because, as much as it is a hugely successful Chinese application, the reality is that the stakes of TikTok‚Äôs success are not strategic. It does not alter the balance of power between the US or China in a dynamic which can have military implications, at least not in a way that something such as semiconductors can. Secondly, such a ban can have shocking reverberations for freedom of speech and there is a serious argument that it may be unconstitutional. Case in point, the previous attempts to ban Chinese applications by the Trump administration, including WeChat and TikTok itself, were blocked in the courts. This sets a precedent regardless of any bill the US Congress may pass.Given this, it is clear that the obsession over TikTok is nothing more than collective mass hysteria, the same mass hysteria which pervades all things related to China in the US today. However, whether this will ever lead to substantial policy outcomes in the TikTok case remains to be seen, and if it ever did, it would likely provoke outrage and cost Biden a generation of young voters.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572417-us-china-tiktok-ban/,2023,Mar,4

Directors of the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) also testified at the hearing.The 40-page report dedicates four pages to Russia, looking at both the conflict in Ukraine and Moscow‚Äôs role in Central Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though the report accuses Russia of ‚Äúunprovoked aggression‚Äù in Ukraine, within a few paragraphs it admits that Moscow acted because it perceived an ‚Äúexistential threat in its neighborhood‚Äù that could ‚Äúendanger Russian national security.‚ÄùThe Ukraine conflict was described as ‚Äúa tectonic event that is reshaping Russia‚Äôs relationships with the West and China, and more broadly in ways that are unfolding and remain highly uncertain.‚ÄùRead moreFormer Russian president eyes ‚Äòfinal nail‚Äô in neocolonialism‚Äôs coffinThe next few years will be ‚Äúcritical to determining who and what will shape the narrative‚Äù in the strategic competition between the US and its allies on one side and Russia and China on the other, said the report.US spies believe Russia‚Äôs ground forces have been weakened by the war and ‚Äúmilitary failures‚Äù in Ukraine, which will compel Moscow to rely on its significant nuclear deterrent.

China meets American hegemony head-on ‚Äî RT World News,"        China meets American hegemony head-on                        In a rare scathing essay, Beijing‚Äôs foreign ministry has blasted Washington‚Äôs continued attempts at world domination            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analyst¬©                Photo by Kevin FrayerGetty ImagesThe Chinese foreign ministry has published an essay titled ‚ÄòUS Hegemony and Its Perils‚Äô, a scathing attack on the United States and itsdesire to effectively rule the world.The essay was widely shared throughout Chinese state media outlets and was probably the harshest thing they‚Äôve ever published at least as far as Washington is concerned. It coincides with Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs recent addressand attacks the US across a broad spectrum of topics, outlining Washington‚Äôs multi-pronged efforts to achieve and maintain exclusive dominance over the entire planet. This includes military action, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as interference in internal political affairs of countries in the form of coups and revolutions.The essay discussed the Arab Spring, US interference in Latin America including the CIA coup in Chile and attempts to undermine the government of Cuba and Venezuela, and the number of ‚Äúcolor revolutions‚Äù in former Soviet states such as Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. It went on to condemn how Washington weaponizes the subject of democracy and forces countries to take sides, branded the US a country ‚Äúcharacterized by violence and expansion‚Äù that crushes its opponents with sanctions and ‚Äúeconomic coercion‚Äù and claimed the (US) dollar of being ‚Äúthe main source of instability and uncertainty in the world economy.‚Äù: China outlines diplomatic goals with RussiaNever has China‚Äôs foreign ministry launched such a blistering attack on the US. For many years, despite Washington‚Äôs turn to hostility towards Beijing, China has been overwhelmingly restrained when it comes to the US. For a long time, it held to the belief that America can be engaged with, that somehow the country can be brought to reason, and that the US-China bilateral relationship can be improved and stabilized. It once held the belief that after the departure of the Donald Trump administration, things could be returned to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù under Joe Biden.That belief could not have been more wrong. After two years in office, the Biden administration has shown itself to be more belligerent and hawkish on China than Trump and his colleagues had ever been, and ties have gone from one new low to another, with the Biden presidency having transformed US policy from a series of ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù Trumpian grievances over trade, to an all-encompassing campaign of military and strategic containment which has dramatically escalated tensions. Trump was a negotiator, who wanted to make trade deals with China to suit American interests using tariffs as leverage, whereas the word ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù does not exist in Biden‚Äôs vocabulary.The Biden administration has repeatedly claimed it wants ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù and ‚Äúlines of communication‚Äù with Beijing, but its actions have shown its real intentions, from allowing Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs highly provocative visit to Taiwan, to stoking paranoia over a balloon, to forcing countries to cut off supplies to China‚Äôs entire semiconductor industry. The conclusion that Beijing has finally arrived at is that when it comes to the United States, there is no serious dialogue to be had. It is a waste of time. China faces a belligerent, hegemonic and bad-faith actor who seeks to contain it and strategically crush it at all costs.: China unveils global security paperThe US is forcing a change in China‚Äôs foreign policy. For many decades, China‚Äôs philosophy was to avoid confrontation with Washington and seek cooperation, to prevent the Americans from moving towards policies of Cold War containment and blocking its economic development, which is the Communist Party‚Äôs overarching domestic priority. This is why even when the US was turning hostile, China remained ambivalent and restrained for a long time. It wanted to believe the relationship with America could be rescued, and these policies could be offset.China now recognizes that its best bet is not appeasing Washington, but that its continued development and prosperity depends on sustaining a multipolar world where American power is diluted. China has formally identified American hegemony as the biggest source of instability, chaos, inequality and conflict in the world, mirroring comments made by Vladimir Putin.As such, the US has no interest in accepting or coming to terms with the rise of any other country which challenges its monopoly on global power, believing its hegemony to be some sort of divine right, and leaving little hope for ‚Äústability‚Äù. It will do everything it can to try and contain China and break up its integration with the global economy. While this does not mean Beijing will do something reckless or risk-prone, it does mean it has finally woken up to the challenge it faces and is no longer, after decades of cordial ties, starry-eyed or deluded about the true nature of the American regime.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571933-china-us-hegemony-beijing/,2023,Feb,23

Mao responded by urging Washington to ‚Äúimmediately end the troops‚Äô illegal occupation and plundering‚Äù and repeal crippling sanctions targeting the Syrian economy.‚ÄúSince the US began its illegal interference in the Syrian crisis, its military operations in Syria have taken away a large number of innocent civilian lives and caused grave humanitarian disasters,‚Äù she said, adding that the US has been ‚Äúcriticized multiple times‚Äù by the United Nations and other international bodies for ‚Äúindiscriminate attacks that may amount to a war crime.‚Äù: US Congress rejects Syria troop pulloutA Republican-sponsored War Powers Resolution was voted down on Wednesday amid strong bipartisan opposition, with critics of the bill arguing a troop pullout could lead to the resurgence of terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). Introduced by Florida Republican Matt Gaetz, the legislation sought a full withdrawal of American soldiers within a period of six months, with the lawmaker observing that Congress never voted to authorize the years-long deployment in the first place.Mao also implored Washington to ‚Äúrespect other countries‚Äô sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,‚Äù and to stop ‚Äúaggravating humanitarian disasters‚Äù in Syria, where a recent earthquake left more than 7,000 dead. US economic penalties have interfered with relief efforts in the wake of the disaster, prompting further calls from Beijing to drop the sanctions and allow for much-needed aid to enter the country unimpeded.The People‚Äôs Republic has previously highlighted alleged oil theft by US forces stationed in Syria‚Äôs resource-rich northeast, where they have long been embedded with Kurdish militia groups.

He has a syndicated column at CGTN and is a freelance reporter for international news agencies including Xinhua News Agency.@BradBlank_A general view of Embassy of the United State of America in Cuba, Havana on September 18, 2017. ¬©                Photo by Yander ZamoraAnadolu AgencyGetty ImagesFor seven years, US diplomats worldwide have succumbed to mysterious illnesses and abnormal acoustic sensations dubbed ‚ÄúHavana syndrome,‚Äù after the first ‚Äúcase‚Äù was detected in the Cuban capital in 2016. These mystery illnesses have racked up burdensome medical bills for many and pushed some into early retirement.Investigators initially pinned these incidents on a suspected high-tech energy weapon, possibly developed by Russia, until an exclusive Washington Post report was released last week. According to the report, which cites anonymous officials familiar with conclusions found by several agencies, the ‚Äúsyndrome‚Äù was not caused by an energy weapon and one agency nixed the idea completely that a foreign adversary was behind it. Reportedly, none of the agencies disagreed with the latter conclusion. Investigations into what exactly happened are still ongoing.However, for years the US media pointed the finger at Russia through ‚Äúscoops‚Äù dropped by anonymous intelligence officials. For instance, Politico reported in 2021 that American spy agencies were lasering in on Russia‚Äôs military intelligence unit, GRU. These officials reportedly debriefed members of Congress on the matter. Likewise, that same year the New Yorker posed the tantalizing question: ‚ÄúAre U.S. Officials Under Silent Attack?‚Äù And, of course, well before this, the likes of CNN and MSNBC were already speculating about a conspiracy on their broadcasts and, as always, blaming the Russians.Read morePayouts to Havana Syndrome victims to continue indefinitelyThe debunking itself comes from a paper that has reported speculative information from ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù intelligence officials in the past. However, it references a number of reports ‚Äì things that exist ‚Äì within US intelligence agencies, which lends it much more substance and credibility.It‚Äôs hard to speculate on what might have been behind the ‚ÄúHavana syndrome‚Äù incidents but what‚Äôs clear is that US officials jumped the gun in blaming Russia. If we turn the clock back seven years, we might recall that this was one of the spikes in anti-Russia hysteria in the US. Report after report came out suggesting that Russia ‚Äúhacked‚Äù the US presidential election that year in favor of Donald Trump. Then the goal posts kept shifting, first to how Russia ‚Äúinterfered‚Äù in the election, and then to how Russia ‚Äúinfluenced‚Äù the election.Each of these reports was debunked and some journalists were even sackedor forced to resign over ‚Äúscoops‚Äù that had not been properly fact-checked. For example, one Washington Post reporter got a scoop from officials that Russia hacked into the state of Vermont‚Äôs energy grid, a claim that was immediately debunked. Another CNN investigation, alleging that Russia had a slush fund in place for Trump-tied officials, led to three journalists, including one executive editor, resigning.Russia‚Äôs vindication regarding the mystery illnesses of US diplomats is a premier case study in unethical speculation by federal officials exacerbated by sloppy journalism. Going back to when ‚ÄúHavana syndrome‚Äù first appeared, we will also remember that it was not long after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Ukraine, which nearly sparked a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, led to the Russian annexation of Crimea and spurred events leading to the current Ukraine crisis.Read moreUS spies debunk ‚ÄòHavana Syndrome‚Äô conspiracy ‚ÄìWaPoUS officials and their media stenographers were trying hard to drive public opinion against Russia by claiming Moscow was directly undermining America‚Äôs democracy and covertly attacking our diplomats around the world. Of course, it was all a bunch of lies, as history has revealed. There needn‚Äôt be a foreign adversary to explain the health issues of US diplomats. Perhaps the explanation is simpler, something like travelers‚Äô sickness, which many people experience. One thing is certain, there was never any actual evidence that Russia was behind these weird illnesses ‚Äì only speculation.We‚Äôre now seeing this in action again after a Chinese balloon was spotted over the continental United States. The US government shot down the airship, speculating that it was part of a surveillance operation. China maintains that it was simply a weather monitoring balloon that had veered off course.In any case, the US is reportedly releasing an investigation on this matter. After the latest revelation about the ‚ÄúHavana syndrome‚Äù, I fully anticipate the report will show that, in fact, it was a civilian weather balloon all along and not a surveillance op. Releasing defamatory ‚Äòscoops‚Äô about adversarial countries, not backed by evidence, has been the modus operandi for US officials and media for a while now.However, I hope these intelligence reports dug up by the Washington Post can be a point of reflection for the media. Hopefully, they will stop embarrassing themselves by uncritically broadcasting the officials‚Äô finger-pointing. The American people are sick of the lies, sick of the transparently false claims roundly reported in the media and sick of not having a media apparatus that actually discusses issues relevant to their lives.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572580-havana-syndrome-cuba-us/,2023,Mar,7

As someone who studied Russian history in college, and who, at an early stage in my development as an adult had the opportunity to live and work in Russia during the Soviet era, I have a deep, yet admittedly incomplete, appreciation for Russia's culture, language and history. This appreciation has helpedme to make judgments about the country, its political leadership, and its people, especially when assessing the interactions between Russia and America today.Withoutthis background, I would expect that I would be susceptible to the Russophobia emanating from the US government and echoed without question by a compliant mainstream American media. With it, I am able to see through the falsehoods and mischaracterizations that appear deliberately designed to warp the sensibilities and logic of Russophobia‚Äôs intended audience ‚Äì the American people.Recently, I ran across an essay that had been published by the Ambassador of Russia to the US, Anatoly Antonov, in the Russian newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, andsubsequently posted on the Russian Embassy Facebook page. The title of the essay,Russophobia as a malignant tumor in the United States, is, admittedly, provocative ‚Äì as all good, thought-provoking titles should be. After reading it, it became apparent to me that, in the interest of combating the trend, I should help bring the Ambassador‚Äôs essay to the attention of as many people as possible. ‚ÄúRussia,‚Äù the essay opens, ‚Äúhas always venerated and respected the rich cultural traditions of all countries.

Culture must always remain the bridge for strengthening trust between the peoples, however complicated the relations between the states may be.‚Äù‚ÄúThere was no ‚Äúcancellation of culture‚Äù even during the Cold War. A lesser-known fact is that the first Tchaikovsky International Competition in 1958 was won by Van Cliburn, an outstanding pianist and U.S. national. His sensational performance in Moscow at the height of the Cold War helped break down barriers and gave hope for finding mutual understanding based on love for classical music.‚ÄùThe story of how Harvey Lavan ‚ÄúVan‚Äù Cliburn, a tall, curly-haired Texan pianist, conquered Moscow is legendary. By 1958, US-Soviet relations were tense, impacted as they were by the politics of the Cold War. To promote a thaw in relations, the Soviets and Americans proposed a series of cultural exchanges. The Soviets, for their part, convened the first International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition, named after the famous Russian composer,Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.Tchaikovsky is perhaps best known in the United States for his rousing1812 Overture, the melodicNutcracker Suite, once a Christmas staple, and the unforgettableSwan Lakeballet. The premise of the competition was to invite 50 musicians from 19 countries to compete in an international competition designed to highlight Soviet accomplishment in the arts. A distinguished jury, headed byDmitry Shostakovich, a legendary composer in his own right, was convened to judge the competition.Cliburn was one of several Americans invited to compete. His rendition of Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto, considered one of his most popular compositions and, as such, familiar to all, leaving little room for error or misinterpretation, brought the crowd to its feet. Olga Kern, one of Russia‚Äôs finest classical pianists, said of the performance, ‚ÄúVan Cliburn won because he played in a grand way. Soaring. It was beautiful; the piano was singing. It sounded so new and fresh. It was incredible.‚ÄùPopular legend has it that Shostakovich was uncertain whether he could award first prize to an American. When the famed Soviet composer approached Nikita Khrushchev for advice, the Soviet leader asked, ‚ÄúIs he the best?‚Äù Shostakovich replied yes to which Khruschev announced, ‚ÄúThen give him the prize!‚ÄùVan Cliburn returned to America a hero and was given a ticker-tape parade down New York City‚Äôs Avenue of Heroes, the only musician ever to be so honored. Time Magazine put him on its cover, with the headline, ‚ÄúThe Texan Who Conquered Russia.‚ÄùSix months prior to Van Cliburn‚Äôs achievement, the Soviets had put the world‚Äôs first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit, an act that left many Americans feeling vulnerable and uncertain. The country still reeled from the Red Scare politics of Senator Joe McCarthy, whose admonition that ‚Äúyou cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers‚Ä¶ without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder‚Äù continued to resonate in certain circles even after his death in 1957.Van Cliburn‚Äôs performance did, in fact, help ‚Äúbreak down barriers‚Äù and give ‚Äúhope for finding mutual understanding.‚Äù There‚Äôs no lie in the essay penned by the Russian diplomat.‚ÄúCultural cooperation,‚Äùthe Ambassador‚Äôs essay noted, ‚Äúhelped melt the ice then. Its significance cannot be overestimated also in our days because the universal language of art unites people of different nationalities, whatever is going on in the realm of big politics.‚ÄùIt was, in short, an historic event, one worthy of continued attention and recognition. And, largely because of the singular accomplishment of Van Cliburn, the International Tchaikovsky Competition went on to become one of the best-known and most respected music competitions in the world.‚ÄúThe competition,‚Äù the essay observed, ‚Äúwas excluded from the World Federation of International Music Competitions in 2022 amidst indiscriminate Russophobia.‚ÄùThis, too, is a true statement. On April 13, 2022, the World Federation of International Music Competitions voted by an overwhelming majority to exclude the International Tchaikovsky Competition from its membership. In a press release the federation declared that ‚ÄúMany laureates of the Tchaikovsky Competition are among the leading artists of today. However, in the face of Russia‚Äôs brutal war and humanitarian atrocities in Ukraine, the [federation] as an apolitical organization cannot support or have as a member, a competition financed and used as a promotional tool by the Russian regime.‚ÄùIn 2003, following the invasion of Iraq by the United States ‚Äì an act widely acknowledged worldwide as a blatant act of aggression that violated international law, the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, one of six American music competitions that are part of a network of some 120 internationally recognized organizations that comprise the federation, and whose collective goal is to ‚Äúdiscover the most promising young talents in classical music through public competition,‚Äù was not excluded by the World Federation of International Music Competitions.So much for the ‚Äúapolitical‚Äù status of the federation. The exclusion by the federation of the International Tchaikovsky Competition is an inherently political act, a clear example of Russophobia. To pretend otherwise is illogical ‚Äì but then again, Russophobia(‚Äúthe fear or dislike of Russia and its people, often based on stereotypes and propaganda‚Äù), like all other phobias, is inherently illogical, representing as it doesan excessive, extreme, irrational, fear or panic reaction derived from ignorance of the subject in question.‚ÄúAnd yet,‚Äù Antonov declared, ‚Äúdespite that, representatives of the United States still seek to become laureates and winners of this prestigious contest. The 2023 Tchaikovsky International Youth Competition, by the way, was attended by 128 gifted performers from 14 countries, including the United States.‚ÄùAgain, not a false statement ‚Äì the XI International Tchaikovsky Competition for Young Musicians was held in Moscow and St. Petersburg in January 2023. There, 27 young musicians from Russia, China, the Republic of Koreaand the United Stateswere selected for participation in the final round. The top two spots were awarded to competitors from China, while the third spot went to a Russian performer. But Americans were there, participating, and that is what matters.Russian artists are considered among the world‚Äôs most accomplished, and many of their works can be found in art galleries around the world. And yet, even here, Russophobia has raised its ugly head, as the Russian essay so pointedly notes. ‚ÄúThe anti-Russian ‚Äòhate virus‚Äô is giving metastases and continues to affect the United States,‚Äù the essay states. ‚ÄúIt has also infected the leading US art galleries that are now trying to outdo each other in their efforts to ‚Äòcancel‚Äô Russian culture.‚ÄúThe Metropolitan Museum of Art,‚Äù Ambassador Antonov reports, ‚Äúhas reclassified great Russian painters Arkhip Kuindzhi, Ivan Aivazovsky and Ilya Repin as Ukrainians guided by the fact that they were born in Mariupol, Feodosia and Chuguev, which is nothing short of a complete absurdity.‚ÄùOnce again, the assertion put forward in the essay is factually correct. ‚ÄúThe Met continually researches and examines objects in its collection in order to determine the most appropriate and accurate way to catalogue and present them,‚Äù a Met spokesperson said, commenting on the reclassification. ‚ÄúThe cataloguing of these works has been updated following research conducted in collaboration with scholars in the field.‚ÄùThe ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù the Met speaks of came in the form of online pressure from someone the Met described as a Ukrainian art historian, Oksana Semenik, whose Twitter account, Ukrainian Art History (@ukr_arthistory) ran a concerted campaign criticizing the Met for incorrectly labelling the works of Arkhip Kuindzhi as Russian. ‚ÄúAll his famous landscapes were about Ukraine, Dnipro, and steppes,‚Äù Semenik tweeted. ‚ÄúBut also about Ukrainian people.‚ÄùAll his famous landscapes were about Ukraine, Dnipro, and steppes. But also about Ukrainian people. 'The head of a Ukrainian peasant in a straw hat' (1895), 'Sunset' , 'Chumaks path in Mariupol' (1875), 'Steppe' pic.twitter.comH334YVkj5Q‚Äî Ukrainian Art History (@ukr_arthistory) January 28, 2023But, as the Ambassador‚Äôs essay points out, ‚ÄúThis does not withstand any criticism at least because the artists considered themselves Russians. Just in case: ethnically, Ilya Repin was Russian, Ivan Aivazovsky was Armenian and Arkhip Kuindzhi was Greek. All three were born in the Russian Empire ‚Äì when Ukrainian statehood did not exist.‚ÄùKuindzhi was a landscape painter from the Russian Empire of Pontic Greek origin. When he was born, in 1841, the city of Mariupol was one of the subdivisions of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire. The landscapes he painted, at the time they were produced, depicted Russian scenes, and Russian people. Kuindzhi, by any account, was a Russian artist.While Ivan Aivazovsky may have been ethnically Armenian, he and all of Russia considered (and considers) him to be an iconic Romantic painter who is considered one of the greatest masters of marine art of all time. Indeed, several of Aivazovsky‚Äôs works hang in Ambassador Antonov‚Äôs residence in Washington, DC.Prior to the reclassification, the Met described Aivazovsky as such: ‚ÄúThe Russian Romantic artist Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky (1817‚Äì1900) was widely renowned for his paintings of sea battles, shipwrecks, and storms at sea. Born into an Armenian family in the Crimean port city of Feodosia, Aivazovsky was enormously prolific‚Äîhe claimed to have created some six thousand paintings during his lifetime. He was a favorite of Tsar Nicholas I and was appointed official artist of the Russian imperial navy.‚ÄùAs for Ilya Repin, his father had served in an Uhlan Regiment in the Russian army, and Repin was a graduate of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg.The Russophobia of the Met did not stop there. As Antonov‚Äôs essay notes, ‚ÄúAnother example of ignorance by the Met is the renaming of Edgar Degas‚Äôs ‚ÄòRussian Dancers‚Äô to ‚ÄòDancers in Ukrainian Dress‚Äô.‚ÄùThis is true. Moreover, in introducing the work the Met declared, ‚ÄúIn 1899, Degas produced a series of compositions devoted to dancers in Ukrainian folk dress,‚Äù ignoring the fact that Degas himself named the drawings ‚ÄúRussian Dancers,‚Äù thereby reflecting the reality that he was devoting his drawings to dancers in Russian folk dress.But historical accuracy is not, apparently, what the Met aspires to. As Ambassador Antonov explains, ‚ÄúMoreover, a comment added beneath the picture now reads: ‚ÄòThe subject reflects the surge of French interest in the art and culture of Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, following France's political alliance with that Empire in 1894‚Äô. Those who came up with this idea did not bother to figure out that it wasdancers of the Russian Imperial Ballet on tour in Paris who inspired the French impressionist to create the masterpiece. It is na√Øve to imagine,‚Äù the Ambassador notes caustically, ‚Äúthat the artist was familiar with ‚Äòthe great Ukrainian choreographic school‚Äô.‚ÄùAnatoly Antonov lambasts the decisions of the Met to cancel Russian art history in the name of virtue signaling. ‚ÄúThe American Museum of Modern Art,‚Äù his essay notes, ‚Äúhas also yielded to the derangement, dedicating a permanent-collection gallery to works by ‚Äòethnic Ukranians‚Äô. Titled ‚ÄòIn Solidarity‚Äô, it features pieces by Kazimir Malevich, Leonid Berlyavsky-Nevelson, Sonia Delaunay-Terk and Ilya Kabakov.‚ÄùKazimir Malevich was an ethnic Pole, born in Kiev in 1879, and widely considered a leading Russian avant-garde artist and art theorist. Malevich‚Äôs pioneering work had a profound influence on the development of abstract art in the 20th century. His art, and associated politics, ran afoul of Joseph Stalin, and Malevich suffered persecution at the hands of the KGB, before dying in Leningrad in 1935.The Ukrainian art historian-turned-activist, Oksana Semenik, led an online campaign to have the Met reclassify Malevich as Ukrainian. ‚ÄúRussian art critics who had access to the KGB archives,‚Äù she tweeted, without referencing either the art critic or the archival material in question, ‚Äúnote that Malevich answered that he was Ukrainian when asked about his nationality.‚ÄùRussian art critics who had access to the KGB archives note that Malevich answered that he was Ukrainian when asked about his nationality.'Self Portrait', 1910 pic.twitter.comSOU2VtIihx‚Äî Ukrainian Art History (@ukr_arthistory) February 23, 2023Semenik went on to tweet, ‚ÄúSo, @MuseumModernArt, how about making corrections about his true nationality? It will be a present for his birthday (note: Malevich was born on February 23.)‚ÄùA modicum of due diligence, however, of the sort one would expect from an institution such as The Metropolitan Museum of Art, where assiduous accuracy in the pursuit of art history is the norm, not the exception, appears to be lacking in the case of Ms. Semenik.Far from a simple art historian, Semenik is what she calls a ‚Äúcultural journalist‚Äù whose articles have been published in outlets such asThe New Statesman, a British political and cultural magazine with a decidedly pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia editorial bias. On April 4, 2022,The New Statesmanpublished an article authored by Semenik entitled ‚ÄúI escaped Russian atrocities in Bucha. My neighbors weren‚Äôt so lucky.‚ÄùThe account of Ms. Semenik is what it is, and it is important to note that she provides no first-hand observations of so-called ‚ÄúRussian atrocities.‚Äù What is more interesting is her naming of her partner, Sashko Popenko, and the name of the person who edited and translated the article into English,Nataliya Gumenyuk. Both are journalists working for the Public Interest Journalism Lab, which in 2022 was awarded the Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an organization formed in 1983 during the Reagan administration to assume control of CIA programs operating overseas designed to influence international public-private opinions and policies. The NED is funded by an annual grant from the United States Information Agency, and receives direct tasking from the US Congress regarding specific countries of interest to the United States. Ukraine has been designated as such a country.In 2015, the NED was banned in Russia under a law targeting so-called ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù international organizations.It is not my position to question the motives of either Ms. Semenik, Ms. Gemenyuk, the Public Interest Journalism Lab, or the NED.Likewise, Russian domestic policy is a matter for Russia and those impacted by it, including the NED.However, one cannot pretend to turn a blind eye, as the Met does, to the fact that its most ardent proponent for the cultural cancellation of Russia in the Met is not a simple Ukrainian ‚Äúart historian,‚Äù but rather an activist affiliated with a partisan Ukrainian organization that receives funding from a US government-controlled agency.By acting on Ms. Semenik‚Äôs passions regarding the re-classification of longstanding Russian artists as Ukrainian (something The Kyiv Post has described as the ‚ÄúDecolonization of Ukrainian art‚Äù), the Met has allowed itself to become, wittingly or otherwise, a de facto tool of anti-Russian propaganda.This is not the proper role of a major American cultural institution.Here I will let the anger and frustration of the Russian Ambassador to the United States manifest itself without comment:‚ÄúJudging by the rhetoric of the American art beau monde, Vasily Kandinsky, a native of Moscow, and his works are next in line to be ‚ÄòUkrainized‚Äô. There is a heated discussion on whether the fact that he studied in Odessa is a good reason to treat him as a Ukrainian artist.Here arises the question for the museum innovators who until recently admired Russian culture: why have they set about perverting historical reality only now? Isn‚Äôt this sudden ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù just a banal tribute to political fashion? Anyway, the time will come for the US cultural elite to sober up and be embarrassed of its doings.‚ÄùPerhaps. But the reality is that what passes for culture today in America is anything but, especially when it comes to all things Russia. Liquor stores have poured ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù vodka out in protest of the Russian military incursion into Ukraine, ignorant of the fact that many of the brands they were disposing of originated from places other than Russia.Other absurdities abound. The Mari Vanna, a well-known Washington, DC-based Russian restaurant, has renamed the famous ‚ÄúMoscow Mule‚Äù mixed drink (two parts vodka, three parts ginger ale, and a squeeze of lime juice)into the ‚ÄúKyiv (sic) Mule,‚Äù and the long-time Russian staple, borscht, has been redefined as ‚Äúthe masterpiece of Ukrainian cuisine.‚ÄùBut the culture war against all things Russian has serious connotations as well. The Russia House, an established Washington, DC-based Russian restaurant, was vandalized in the weeks following the Russian incursion into Ukraine, leading the owners to shutter their doors for good (the restaurant, like many others, had temporarily closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.)In New York City, the iconic Russian Samovar restaurant came under attack simply because of its name, forcing the owners to fly Ukrainian flags and profess their open support for Ukraine, lest they, too, be subject to attacks that would derail their business.It is not just Russian culture that is being cancelled in the US, but Russian people, including those dispatched by the Russian government for the singular task of improving relations between the two countries. A recentexpos√©published inPolitico, entitled ‚ÄúLonely Anatoly: The Russian ambassador is Washington‚Äôs least popular man,‚Äù observes that ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs ambassador to the United States can‚Äôt get meetings with senior officials at the White House or the State Department. He can‚Äôt convince US lawmakers to see him, much less take a photo. It‚Äôs the rare American think tanker who‚Äôs willing to admit to having any contact with the envoy.‚ÄùAmbassador Antonov is not the only Russian official singled out for diplomatic isolation. In March 2022, at the request of the Ukrainian embassy‚Äôs defense attach√©, the Canadian Embassy orchestrated a vote by the Defense Attach√©s‚Äô Association, a professional and social organization for defense attach√©s and their spouses whose dean is selected by the Defense Intelligence Agency, to expel Major General Evgeny Bobkin, the Russian Military Attach√© assigned to the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, from the group.‚ÄúIt was hard to believe that xenophobia could take roots,‚Äù Ambassador Antonov observed, ‚Äúin a state which is supposed to be resting on the principles of cultural and ethnical diversity and tolerance to different peoples. Nevertheless, US politicians not only encourage hatred of everything Russian, but actively implant it in the minds of citizens. In recent years, they have never stopped fabricating baseless accusations to justify tougher sanctions.‚ÄùOne of the problems confronting the Russian government and people today is the quality of individuals that comprise what passes for ‚ÄúRussia experts‚Äù in America today. Gone are the days when men such as Jack Matlock, the former US Ambassador to Russia, or Stephen Cohen, the lateProfessor Emeritus of Russian and Slavic Studies who taught at Columbia, Princeton, and New York University, walkedthe halls of academia and power. Both men possessed a deep appreciation of Russian history, culture, traditions, language, and politics. Erudite and tough, they articulated for better relations between Russia and the US.Today, they have been replaced by people like Michael McFaul, the former US Ambassador to Russia under Barack Obama, and Fiona Hill, a National Security Council ‚Äúexpert‚Äù on Russia in both the Obama and Trump White Houses. Both McFaul and Hill have expressed a Putin-centric approach when assessing Russia, where everything is explained through an incomplete and narrowly focused concentration on the Russian leader over the Russian nation.The contrast between the approaches taken by Matlock and Cohen, on the one hand, an McFaul and Hill, on the other, could not be more stark; the formerargued for bridging the differences through better understanding, and thelatter for managing differences through confrontation and attempted isolation.One approach promotes peaceful coexistence based upon principles of shared humanity.The other promotes never-ending conflict fueled by Russophobia. ‚ÄúRussian culture,‚Äù Ambassador Antonov concludes, ‚Äúdoes not belong only to Russia. It is the world‚Äôs treasure. We know the Americans as appreciative connoisseurs of true art. Not so long ago tours of the troupes of the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theatres as well as our renowned musicians drew packed houses and were always greeted with a storm of applause. The local audience is apparently longing for Russian performers and art exhibitions.‚Äù‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it time to stop the Russophobic madness?‚Äù the Russian Ambassador asks. That, I believe, isthequestion that defines our times, and our collective fate.Who among us will be the next Van Cliburn? Who will challenge the modern McCarthyism by refusing to bow to the insane pressures of Russophobia, and decide instead to engage with the Russian people as people, with full respect and admiration for their culture, heritage, traditions, and history? This journey doesn‚Äôt require a trip to Moscow. Defeating Russophobia begins here at home, simply by choosing not to buy into the madness promulgated on the part of those who seek to promote conflict by promoting fear generated by ignorance.When it comes to stopping the madness of Russophobia, there is no time like the present. Because if we allow fear-based prejudice to prevail, there may be no tomorrow.This article was first publishedby Scott Ritter on his website.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572274-russophobia-new-red-scare/,2023,Mar,3

However, Biden‚Äôs Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) deemed the water safe to drink based on only a few tainted lab samples provided by Norfolk Southern, the rail company responsible for the catastrophe. Apparently, the EPA never tested the water samples itself.According to reports, the rail company plans to create a $1 million fund for the residents of East Palestine, which, as commentators have pointed out, is far below the $4 billion it spent on stock buybacks last year. In all, that amounts to about $200 a pop for the town‚Äôs nearly 5,000 residents. Apparently, that‚Äôs all the company thinks it should pay forward over this environmental disaster.The cherry on top is that Norfolk Southern is reportedly asking the nation‚Äôs Supreme Court to kill a lawsuit by a sick rail worker and help the firm block future lawsuits against itself over the incident. The Biden administration is now siding with the company, as it did in December when it pusheda ‚Äúskinny deal"" on railway workers across the country who were threatening to strike over pay and working condition concerns.Furthermore, if Secretary Buttigieg, the guy in charge of regulating the railway industry, was asked what the big deal is about, he‚Äôd tell you, ‚ÄúWhile this horrible situation has gotten a particularly high amount of attention, there are roughly 1,000 cases a year of a train derailing."" The DoT is being heavily criticizedfor not reinstating an Obama-era rail safety rule to implement new braking systems since the country‚Äôs railways still use Civil War-era technology. The Trump administration repealed this mandate and the Biden administration did not put it back on the books. So, whatever, just get used to it.The story of what happened in Ohio is truly a tale of unbridled corporate greed coupled with politicians unwilling to regulate the railway industry because of the powerful interests in Washington that prop it up. It transcends party lines. Both Republicans and Democrats are at fault for failing to regulate railways and spewing the company‚Äôs propaganda after the incident on February 3rd, even defaulting to their in-house water tests. The corruption on display truly boggles the mind.Read moreBiden‚Äôs Kiev trip ‚Äòa slap in the face‚Äô to America ‚Äì US CongressmanOddly, all Biden had to do was show up to at least display the slightest amount of empathy required to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the ensuing political battle. Literally, to just physically be at the site of the incident, shake hands, kiss babies and give a speech where he promises to help those affected. But, instead of doing the absolute bare minimum, he flies halfway across the world to Ukraine and pledges half a billion dollars, on top of the billions already given, for a war that has nothing to do with the interests of average Americans.Biden just gave a healthy serving of political points to Donald Trump on a silver platter. Doubtless, Trump will point out Biden‚Äôs hypocrisy, lack of interest or care and perhaps even his relentless pro-war agenda. It will be a speech that many independents might find appealing and it will certainly tap into the angst of the white midwestern American working class, which is, to note, an essential demographic for anyone who wants to become President of the United States.The Biden administration's failure on this issue is immense. It is not just that he materially failed to safeguard Americans‚Äô well-being, but he also made Trump, whose former presidential administration was an absolute calamity for the working class, the winner in all of this. It is hard to find an explanation for how someone with 52 years of political experience could so massively screw this up.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571909-biden-ukraine-ohio-train-derailment/,2023,Feb,22

The document is one of several indications of Washington‚Äôs increased hawkishness towards Tehran, the outlet argued.The contingency plan code-named ‚ÄòSupport Sentry‚Äô was funded in the fiscal year 2019. Given that the Pentagon‚Äôs resources are not unlimited, the fact that effort was expended to produce such a document means that US military planners consider the risk of a clash with Iran significant enough, The Intercept suggested.Another sign of a possible escalation was the order to reassign Israel from European Command (EUCOM) to Central Command (CENTCOM) in the Pentagon‚Äôs responsibility structure, the story said. Carried out by Trump just four days before the inauguration of President Joe Biden, the reassignment built on the rapprochement between Israel and the Arab states under the so-called Arab Accords.

US gaslighting China and the world with warnings against Taiwan aggression ‚Äî RT World News,"        US gaslighting China and the world with warnings against Taiwan aggression                        Washington says Beijing must not use lawmaker visits as pretext for an attack ‚Äì while trying to provoke exactly that            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman ¬©                JIM WATSON  AFPThe United States has publicly warned China against using US lawmakers‚Äô visits to Taiwan ‚Äúas a pretext for military action‚Äù and has demanded that other countries warn Beijing against conflict over the island.The statements were made last week by US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. They come amid speculation that more American congressional representatives will soon visit Taiwan. US lawmakers have been making such trips since then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs visit last August, which created a crisis and caused China to respond with large-scale military exercises. Sherman‚Äôs warning also comes amid an increase in US-China tensions over the so-called ‚Äòspy balloon‚Äô that recently flew over American territory.According to the US, China is an aggressor seeking to unilaterally change the status quo over Taiwan. Meanwhile, Western mainstream media keep the tensions up by speculating as to whether Beijing will invade to accomplish its affirmed goal of ‚Äúreunification.‚Äù Throughout the past year, the Taiwan issue was given more traction by the events in Ukraine, which the US has been exploiting to make comparisons in order to push for the expansion of NATO influence to Asia.Read moreUFO defense: Washington turns to sci-fi to boost military spendingBut who really wants war? Washington claims to support peace and stability with its constant warnings and preparations for what it calls a military contingency in the Taiwan strait. In reality, the US is deliberately undermining the established consensus of the One China principle, forcing Beijing to react and subsequently branding it the aggressor. This, in turn, legitimizes Washington‚Äôs ongoing militarization of the region and asserts its clout over regional partners by placing them in a situation where they have to choose sides.American foreign policy selectively weaponizes the idea of self-determination in order to project military power on a global scale. Using its ideology, the US proclaims it is a champion of free countries to allow it to militarize certain regions of the globe against rival powers. For example, the US uses the former USSR and Soviet Bloc countries to sustain military dominance in Europe, and uses Israel to project itself in the Middle East. Now, Washington is seeking military hegemony over a region it describes as the Indo-Pacific in a bid to contain the rise of China.Of course, it is impossible to get countries of a given region to agree to mass US militarization and destabilization if there is no political will or incentive to do so. For many decades Asia has been integrating within itself, which provides an emphasis on common peace and stability, despite the many disputes that often come with it. This means the US needs an ‚Äúentry point‚Äù in order to force its way into the region, to undermine the existing regional order, and transform it into a zero-sum rendering of ideological and geopolitical confrontation against China ‚Äì in other words, a Cold War model.Read more‚ÄòStop being a troublemaker,‚Äô China tells NATOHow does it do this? As with NATO and Russia, the US actively seeks to foster military tensions by playing up the Taiwan issue and declaring China the aggressor. Thus, in recent years, the US has begun to downplay its commitment to the One China policy it established as the foundation of its diplomatic relations with Beijing, and actively uses the island as a wedge in the containment of China. The US sees Taiwan as being positioned among several key island chains and maritime routes, which, if allowed to return to Beijing‚Äôs full control, will change the balance of power in the region permanently in its favor. So, the US sees multiple strategic benefits in promoting Taiwan‚Äôs ‚Äòde-facto‚Äô independence and using it to bait China into provoking instability.In doing so, the US has been able to reassert geopolitical clout over both Japan and the Philippines, effectively locking them into Taiwan contingency scenarios. The US scored a big win in recent weeks when it won consent from Manila to gain access to four additional military bases, which as it happens are near Taiwan. In doing so, the US pits itself not as an enabler or guarantor of regional peace, but as a disruptor and, if China subsequently responds by invading Taiwan, it would seek to try and apply the ‚ÄúRussia model‚Äù to Beijing, aiming to isolate it and break up integration with the surrounding region and the West through massive sanctions. In doing so, even if no war occurs, the US is actively seeking to stir up a sense of crisis and opposition to a Taiwan emergency in Asia.In conclusion, the United States claims that it opposes conflict, yet reaping benefits from it as a means of geopolitical projection. As a matter of fact, peace and security in the Taiwan strait, manifesting in a scenario where Taiwan puts asides its differences with mainland China consensually and agrees to resolve the longstanding issue, is disastrous for American interests. It‚Äôs the last thing Washington wants. Instead, the US wants to continually provoke tensions to promote deeper militarization of China‚Äôs periphery and to frame Beijing‚Äôs responses as acts of aggression. These warnings are, therefore, pure gaslighting.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571748-us-warning-china-taiwan/,2023,Feb,20

We don‚Äôt let it worry us anymore or undermine our lives, and the harshest restrictions, apart from a few places, are firmly a thing of the past.However, there‚Äôs one lingering aftermath of the pandemic which refuses to go away, and that‚Äôs the political blame game. Over the past few days, the US government has again been cultivating the ‚Äúlab leak‚Äù conspiracy theory, claiming that the –°ovid-19 virus originated from a laboratory leak in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The re-emergence of these claims seems random, but it has been coordinated across the administration. First, the US Department of Energy issued areport on the matter, then US ambassador to China Nicholas Burns called on Beijing to be ‚Äúmore honest‚Äù about Covid origins, which was followed by FBI Director Christopher Wray making his statement.The question is: why are they doing this? And why now? The answer is, yet again, the US is weaponizing this conspiracy theory in a bid to undermine China publicly. Specifically, the goal is to create a public distraction from several issues China has been focusing on lately. One of those is the chemical disaster plaguing the US state of Ohio after last month‚Äôs train derailment, and the Biden administration‚Äôs bungled response to it. The other is China‚Äôs Ukraine peace plan.: White House distances itself from Covid ‚Äòlab-leak‚Äô theoryFor three years, the US has used the Covid-19 pandemic as a public opinion weapon against China across a number of areas, openly scapegoating Beijing for the pandemic and its consequences, while also seeking to depict China‚Äôs response to the pandemic negatively. Examples include: framing China as culpable for a coverup, claiming China is responsible for the worldwide spread of the virus, depicting China‚Äôs lockdowns as brutal and inhumane, and of course, spreading the laboratory leak theory, which has never been taken seriously by credible biomedical experts.It seemed that by 2023, the dismay and struggle of the Covid-19 pandemic was finally over, as even China forfeited its ‚Äúzero-Covid‚Äù policy and moved on with life as usual. Not so, says the US as it begins weaponizing the lab leak theory yet again, which is quickly circulated and endorsed by the mainstream media. Ironically, the same media have very little to say about the fallout of the environmental disaster in Ohio, or the credible report that the Nord Stream pipelines were actively sabotaged by the United States.Of course, it is no coincidence that these events are, as it happens, the precise reason for the coordinated re-emergence of the laboratory leak theory. Following the drama and anti-China hysteria promulgated by the recent ‚Äúspy balloon‚Äù incident, Chinese state media and commentators have hit back at the US by relentlesslycriticizing the Ohio disaster, using that as a public opinion offensive of their own. In addition to that, Beijing has tried to influence the direction of the Ukraine war by proposing a peace plan of its own, one which does not support Washington‚Äôs objectives in the country, calls for compromise, and has subsequently been dismissed by US officials.: Beijing responds to FBI‚Äôs Covid origin claimWhat does the US do to respond to this? It reignites the lab leak theory to distract the conversation. There‚Äôs no evidence provided to the public, but the sensational statements by American officials never fail to be amplified by the media, with the result being whipped-up public outrage against China. Then the US moves from one anti-China ‚Äúmeme‚Äù to the next. It is because of this constant public opinion manipulation that it has become impossible for Washington and Beijing to normalize and stabilize their ties, which is leading to a vicious circle and becoming inherently dangerous.In conclusion, the concerted re-emergence of this theory is critical evidence of how the US manipulates global discourse and public opinion. In this particular scenario, however, the US is not using the lab leak theory to pursue any specific policy goals, such as manufacturing consent for sanctions, but is doing so as a tit-for-tat distraction against China‚Äôs focus on the Ohio chemical disaster. Whether this tactic will work is up for debate. The world has had enough of the Covid blame game, and, without some hard evidence, the lab leak theory will never be as effective a narrative tool as it once was.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572260-covid19-pandemic-lab-leak/,2023,Mar,2

Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations,insisting the balloon was a civilian weather device that had been blown off course by accident.‚ÄúAcross the globe there are many balloons in the sky, from different countries. Do you want to down each and every one of them?‚Äù Wang asked. Washington itself has flown high-altitude balloons over Chinese airspace at least 10 times since May 2022, Beijing claimed last week.: Snowden labels UFO craze a distractionThe balloon incident deepened the diplomatic rift and derailed the US State Secretary‚Äôs rare visit to Beijing, but on Saturday, Antony Blinken confronted Wang on the sidelines of the Munich conference to make it ‚Äúclear the United States will not stand for any violation of our sovereignty.‚Äù He also lectured his Chinese counterpart on the Ukraine conflict, North Korean missile tests and Taiwan, as well as Washington's ‚Äúvalues and interests,‚Äùaccording to a brief readout.It was not immediately clear what Wang told Blinken in private, but in a public speech he urged Washington to ‚Äúrectify‚Äù its misguided approach to China-US relations and stop trying to ‚Äúdivert attention from its domestic problems‚Äùby blowing such ‚Äúpreposterous things‚Äù out of proportion.The Chinese diplomat did not specify the domestic problems the US should rather focus on, but he had previously suggested that Washington was trying to deflect people‚Äôs attention from a toxic train incident in Ohio, which happened just one day before the Pentagon sent an F-22 fighter jet to destroy the airship after tracking it idly for over a week.: US hobby club reports missing balloon after ‚ÄòUFO shootdowns‚ÄôEarlier this week, Wang also noted how US media headlines had been dominated by UFO encounters in the days after a bombshell report by Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh about a covert US operation to blow up Russian Nord Stream gas pipelines.The US has managed to recover the debris of the Chinese balloon for further study, but the search for the remaining three downed UFOs was called off on Saturday, with no debris found.

The report not only offers, at-times shocking, detail on the level of Washington‚Äôs betrayal, but important lessons for America‚Äôs international allies today.Read moreDogs of war: Here‚Äôs why the Ukraine conflict could be about to spread to another European countryIf only you knew how bad things really areThe ANDSF‚Äôs collapse was quite a sight to behold. The vast fighting force, constructed at a cost of $90 billion over 20 years, seemed to vanish even faster than the American aircraft escaping Kabul airport. This is despite US officials endlessly claiming in the leadup to the West‚Äôs wholesale pullout from Afghanistan that the government was more than capable of defending itself without foreign support.However, SIGAR‚Äôs appraisal makes clear this disintegration was a long-time in the making. The February 2020 Dohar agreement between formerPresident DonaldTrump's administration and the Taliban meant that the ANDSF could no longer rely on the US military‚Äôs presence in Afghanistan to protect against losses, move weaponry and other supplies around the country on its behalf, or even for their salaries to be paid by the government in Kabul.As a result, the often unpaid army units stationed around the country lacked ammunition, food, water, and other basic necessities to ‚Äúsustain military engagements against the Taliban‚Äù - and any will whatsoever to fight.‚ÄúThe Taliban‚Äôs military campaign exploited the ANDSF‚Äôs logistical, tactical, and leadership weaknesses. Direct attacks and negotiated surrenders set up a domino effect of one district after another falling to the Taliban,‚Äù SIGAR records. ‚ÄúThe Taliban‚Äôs media and psychological warfare campaign, magnified by real-time reporting, further undermined the Afghan forces‚Äô determination to fight.‚Äù                   FILE PHOTO: An Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) personnel sits in the back of a vehicle as he patrols during a military operation in Guzara district in Herat province.     ¬© HOSHANG HASHIMI  AFP                                                        Even before the Dohar agreement though, ‚Äúunderlying and systemic factors‚Ä¶made the ANSDF vulnerable to collapse in the first place.‚Äù Chief among them, US plans to build the Afghan armed forces were ‚Äúdisconnected from a realistic understanding of the time required‚Äù to do so. This is despite Washington taking decades to achieve a similar result in South Korea.Advisors themselves were also judged by SIGAR to be ‚Äúoften poorly trained and inexperienced for their mission.‚Äù Key challenges were ‚Äúlimited or no pre-deployment and in-theater training, and frequent rotational deployments that lacked proper handovers.‚Äù These shortcomings meant the US could neither build relationships with nor improve the capacity of the ANDSF.Read moreBack in the USSR: 15-minute cities have unleashed a wave of conspiracy theories, but the concept is borrowed from a Soviet ideaDespite the report‚Äôs inventory of savage indictments, it concludes by stating SIGAR is ‚Äúnot making any recommendations‚Äù for future US action, or policy, as a result of its findings. Pentagon officials probably wouldn‚Äôt listen even if any were offered. An annex of the document notes that the Department of Defense‚Äôs engagement with SIGAR‚Äôs investigation was minimal, with virtually none of the information requested turned over.The Pentagon ‚Äúonly provided limited responses to SIGAR‚Äôs request for information and missed every deadline for responding to SIGAR‚Äôs questions or for providing feedback to vetting drafts of this report,‚Äù the appraisal notes. For example in November 2021, SIGAR submitted 21 separate questions to the Department of Defense, asking for replies by 21 December 2021. It wasn‚Äôt until eight months later ‚Äúlimited records‚Äù were given.Lessons to learnStill, the lessons of SIGAR‚Äôs report are very clear. First and foremost, its disclosures stand as a stark warning of the fate that could await close US allies, should Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúinterests‚Äù be served by abandoning them at a given moment.For example, ANDSF members who did not manage to flee Afghanistan following the US withdrawal have either been killed or joined ‚Äúextremist groups‚Äù. Either way, they‚Äôve been completely forgotten about, an obvious outcome of Washington showing little interest in ensuring safe passage out of the country for its former proxy fighters, before, during or after its own escape.

They have been detected in videos of military parades, and training sessions.It was even difficult for Washington to know which weaponry and ammunition hadbeen sent to Afghanistan by the Department of Defense. SIGAR found officials failed to provide accurate accounting of shipments, and fell far short of oversight requirements ‚Äúfor monitoring sensitive equipment transferred to the Afghan government and the ANDSF,‚Äù making it likely that equipment could be lost or stolen. Internal controls failed to offer protection against fictitious records being logged in internal monitoring systems.Read more70 years after Stalin‚Äôs death: How Western propaganda has rebranded the Soviet dictator from villain to hero, and back againNonetheless, the US did scramble to rescue some of the gearit provided to the ANDSF, in particular aircraft intended for the ill-fated Afghan Air Force.Some of the salvaged planes were moved into storage in the US, while ‚Äúothers have already been repurposed and sent to other countries, such as Ukraine.‚ÄùThe reference to these jets reaching Ukraine is particularly fitting, given it was not long after its hasty retreat from Afghanistan ‚Äì following 20 years of failure ‚Äì that Kiev became the primary foreign policy focus for the White House.

He is also a member of the Russian International Affairs Council.Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual address to the Federal Assembly, including lawmakers of the State Duma, members of the Federation Council, regional governors and other officials, in Moscow, Russia. ¬©                Sputnik  Maksim BlinovIn his recent landmarkaddress to Russia‚Äôs parliament, President Vladimir Putin cited the war in Ukraine and USNATO involvement in the conflict as the main reason for his decision to ‚Äúsuspend‚Äù Moscow‚Äôs participation in the 2010 New START Treaty on strategic nuclear weapons. Putin also suggestedthat Russia should be ready to resume nuclear testing.Effectively, this announcement, promptly turned into law by the Russian parliament, means a formal end to the long-ailing institutions of strategic arms control that began over 50 years ago. If New START is followed by the CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) and then the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty), strategic deregulation will be complete. Putin‚Äôs logic is that the United States cannot be allowed to inspect Russian missile bases while at the same time pursuing a policy of ‚Äústrategically defeating‚Äù Moscowin Ukraine.The Kremlin‚Äôs decision was anything but a bolt from the blue. The proxy war in Ukraine came asthe culmination ofa decade-and-a-half-long process of steady deterioration of Russian-American and Russian-EU relations. Ever since it became clear ‚Äì somewhere in the mid-2000s ‚Äì that Russia would not fit into the US-dominated order, and that Washington, and its, allies would not let Russia sign upon terms that Moscow would find acceptable, the trajectory of the relationship has generally pointed toward confrontation.True, there was a brief period, which coincided with the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev (2008-12), which witnessed, besides the signing of New START, an attempt to build a strategic partnership between Russia and NATO and modernization and technology partnerships between Russia and key Western countries, including the US and Germany. That attempt, however, turned out to be the last hurrah of the efforts to integrate Russia into, or at least with, the West following the end of the Cold War.Essentially, while Moscow was looking for equal and indivisible security, as well as technology and business opportunities, Washington and Berlin were mostly interested in softening and diluting Russia‚Äôs domestic political regime. There was also no question of treating Russian security concerns about NATO‚Äôs enlargement seriously: Moscow had to accept the post-Cold War order in which it no longer had a decisive voice. That mismatch of key goals could not last long. Alreadyby2011-12, the outlook for Russia-West relations could be summarized as something like: it will get worse before it gets worse.Right now, we are still on the same trajectory ‚Äì things can become even more grim than they are now.Read moreAndrey Sushentsov: Here‚Äôs why Ukraine‚Äôs Zelensky wants a long war with RussiaHopefully, the credible threat of complete annihilation ‚Äì the heart of nucleardeterrence ‚Äì will still protect us from the very worst outcome, but the changes wrought by the Ukraine war on the global strategic landscape during its first year are indeed massive. Strategic deregulation between Moscow and Washington has already been highlighted. In practice, this will mean that each party will be free to build, structure, and deploy its strategic forces as it sees fit, and rely on its own so-called national technical means ‚Äì such as spy satellites and other forms of intelligence ‚Äì as the prime source of information about the other. It is natural to expect that under such circumstances both parties would have a powerful incentive to engage in worst-case-scenario planning.It is true that of the five 'established' nuclear powers and the four other countries that possess nuclear arms, only two‚Äì America and Russia‚Äì have historically engaged in nuclear arms control. For years, Washington sought to find ways to link Beijing to the US-Russia strategic dialogue, thus leading toa tripartite arrangement. China, which was never interested in the US offer, is now believed to be in the process of substantially expanding and improving its strategic nuclear forces.Whether and when Beijing will be ready to engage Washington in strategic arms talks is anyone‚Äôs guess. After the the USformally designated China as its principal adversary, Sino-American relations have been growing increasingly tense. In any event, managing a strategic equation among the three leading nuclear powers, one of which regards the other two as its adversaries, will now become more difficult.Strategic deregulation is not just the absence of binding treaties. It is also likely to mean the unraveling of the conceptual framework for arms control, which was originally developed by the Americans in the 1960s and then accepted by the Soviet Union. Any future arrangements among the world‚Äôs nuclear powers ‚Äì whenever it comes ‚Äì will require a wholly new concept that might be based on the agreed-upon and mutually fitting elements developed by the participating countries, with their vastly different strategic environments and cultures. It will certainly be a most daunting task.Read moreFyodor Lukyanov: US-China trade is surging as military tensions escalate, what exactly is going on?Putin‚Äôs angry reaction to NATO‚Äôs call for Russia to observe New START and let US inspectors in has opened up another relatively minor issue: the nuclear weapons of Britain and France. The Soviet Union had long insisted on including those two countries‚Äô nuclear arsenals in the US ceilings, and only relented during Gorbachev‚Äôs perestroika. With Paris and London taking an active role in the proxy war in Ukraine, Moscow is no longer pretending that UK and French nuclear forces are there solely to defend their own countries. They are seen as part of the combined arsenal of the adversarial, US-led West. This is no big deal for the moment, but any conceivable future arrangement would have to address the issue of the Anglo-French forces.In geopolitical terms, the war in Ukraine energized Washington to build a global coalition to oppose Russia. This is often presented as a major achievement of the administration of President Joe Biden. Yet, to look at this from a different perspective, the Russia (and China) policies of the three successive US administrations ‚Äì Obama‚Äôs, Trump‚Äôs, and particularly Biden‚Äôs‚Äì have led to a major split among the great powers that widened from competition to bitter rivalry (with China) and proxy war (with Russia in Ukraine).US efforts to get China to distance itself from Russia appear ridiculousin a situation where Washington‚Äôs strategy appears to be to defeatcontainitstwo main adversaries one by one, and, moreover,to pitthem against each other. The famous Kissingerian triangle is now pointed in a different direction: it is Washington that has the worst possible relations with the other two. As for Moscow and Beijing, they are getting even closer as a result.Closer cooperation and coordination between China and Russia amid the war in Ukraine,which is gradually emerging on the platform of common strategic interests, represents a major shift in the world power balance. What is more ‚Äì andwhat goes well beyond the usual Western concept of 'great power competition'‚Äì is the rise of over a hundred actors of different caliber in many parts of the world that have refused to support the US,and its allies, on the Russia sanctions and have maintained or even expanded their trade and other relations with Moscow. These countries insist on following their own national interests as they see them and seek to expand their foreign policy autonomy. At the end of the day, this phenomenon ‚Äì call it the Rise of the Global Majority (no longer silent) ‚Äì could be the single most important development so far en route to the new world order.ANALYSIS                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571927-war-reshaping-world-order/,2023,Feb,24

However once the conflictescalated in February 2022, Bulgarian manufacturers enjoyed a rapid increase in profits, doubling sales last year.Bulgaria is a major producer of munitions compatible with Soviet-designed weapons, which Ukraine used extensively before the US and its allies supplied it with Western-produced alternatives. Last year alone, at least $1 billion in arms was transferred from Bulgaria to Ukraine, mostly through Poland and Romania, sources told EURACTIV. No direct arms contracts were signed, the outlet added.The funneling of arms was done through foreign schemes and funded using foreign finance, according to Velizar Shalamanov, the former acting defense minister and a vocal supporter of shipping arms to Ukraine.Read moreEU member ‚Äòsecretly‚Äô supplied Kiev with arms & fuel ‚Äì media‚ÄúThere is a program with good funding in Great Britain, the United States and Poland.

While there is little authoritative research to back up or disprove these claims, a number of studies suggest that the demographics seen on TV might not represent reality.A 2017 survey of 500 companies found that marketing departments were so concerned about being accused of racism or homophobia that they were using fewer straight, white models and actors in their advertisements.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stated afterwards that 10,000 homes for Jewish settlers would be built in these locations. While the UN Security Council issued a statement denouncing the move, the US reportedly intervened to thwart a Palestinian plan to issue a legally binding resolution instead.Retroactively authorizing these illegally built outposts is ‚Äúa significant violation of a commitment that the Israeli government made in writing to the American government back in 2004,‚Äù Kurtzer told a Jewish Democratic Council of America conference on Thursday.Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised in 2004 that he would demolish any unauthorized Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

US treasury head pledges to fortify Ukrainian economy ‚Äî RT World News,"        US treasury head pledges to fortify Ukrainian economy                        Janet Yellen took a surprise trip to Kiev amid rising inflation and recession fears back at home            Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen shake hands during their meeting in Kiev, Ukraine, February 27, 2023 ¬©                Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via APUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has traveled to Ukraine to meet with President Vladimir Zelensky and other top officials, vowing indefinite support for Kiev despite a lagging US economy and trillions in government debt.The unannounced trip to the Ukrainian capital kicked off on Monday, with Yellen saying she wanted to highlight the White House‚Äôs ‚Äúclose partnership in providing economic and budgetary support‚Äù for Kiev during her meeting with Zelensky.‚ÄúOur support is not ‚Äòcharity,‚Äô it‚Äôs an ‚Äòinvestment in global security and democracy,‚Äô‚Äù she said ‚Äì echoing Zelensky‚Äôs own words to US lawmakers during his trip to Washington, DC in December. The official added that US assistance would continue ‚Äúfor as long as it takes‚Äù amid the conflict with Russia.Yellen‚Äôs visit comes days after Washington announced $12 billion in additional aid for Kiev, including a $2 billion arms package and $10 billion more to support energy costs and the Ukrainian government‚Äôs budget. She noted on Monday that the US has provided nearly $50 billion in support since last year, much of it devoted to weapons.: Zelensky threatens unsupportive AmericansIn an op-ed published during her junket to Kiev, Yellen acknowledged that Ukraine still has ‚Äúvast unmet economic needs,‚Äù arguing that Washington must continue ‚Äúfortifying‚Äù Kiev‚Äôs ‚Äúhome front‚Äù to enable ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äôs stalwart frontline defense against Russia.‚ÄùHowever, despite her vocal support for American largesse to Kiev, the Treasurychief also noted economic troubles back in the United States, telling CNN on Monday that inflation remains ‚Äútoo high‚Äù while pointing to massive debt held by the US government. With Congress nearly reaching its $31.4 trillion debt limit, Yellen said the Treasury has been forced to take ‚Äúextraordinary measures‚Äù in order to avoid a disastrous default, which, in a worst-case scenario, could mean suspended welfare payments to Americans and chaos in the financial markets.: Americans warned of financial ‚Äòcatastrophe‚ÄôThe US is a ‚Äúcountry with the deepest most liquid financial markets where Treasuries are the ultimate safe asset,‚Äù she said, adding ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs utterly essential to preserve that to avoid economic and financial catastrophe.‚ÄùThroughout the year-long conflict with Russia, Kiev has demanded increasingly heavy weapons from its foreign backers, with Washington agreeing to supply a long list of advanced arms, vehicles and ammunition. Though recent polls indicate that support for continued aid is falling among Americans, Ukrainian officials have nonetheless continued to press for additional weapons and cash. When asked about the lagging enthusiasm during a briefing last week, President Zelensky warned the US would ‚Äúlose [its] leadership position‚Äù in the world should it cease the flow of weapons.

He has a syndicated column at CGTN and is a freelance reporter for international news agencies including Xinhua News Agency.Bradley Blankenship is an American journalist,columnist and political commentator.

That book described the entire process of globalization and how the world was ‚Äúflattened,‚Äù or in other words, how the playing field was leveled for workers to compete against one another across the globe.Listening to his lectures about the book, my teacher clearly wanted us to be able to find our place in the globalized economy since, at that time, we were just coming out of the Great Recession. And I think that, at least on a subconscious level, I understood the general message from this class because Friedman described a group of experts, people who could explain things well and leverage their knowledge in the globalized world, who would be immune from offshoring and outsourcing.Of course, he was alluding to academics, journalists, columnists, consultants and, well, basically people like himself. And while I‚Äôm not anywhere near the same level of prestige as Mr. Friedman, that also includes folks like me now. So, in a way, a class I took when I was 14 helped me find a niche in a highly competitive ‚Äúflat‚Äù world.Read moreAI-generated entertainment: Dystopian reality or just ‚Äòsomething, for a while‚Äô?At least it seemed that way until AI emerged and programs like ChatGPT emerged. ChatGPT is a software application developed by the American tech firm OpenAI and released in November of last year. It‚Äôs basically a chatbot that you can talk to, ask questions to and perform other functions, like writing code with common language.It learns from input from users (and its developers) but does have some limitations, such as not being able to give its own opinions or have accurate information about current affairs after 2021. However, the AI is still famous for its vast array of knowledge and, in fact, it has now gone on to make the news nearly every day by passing high-level university exams, including an MBA exam from the Wharton School of Business. This has universities clamoring to find out how their ‚Äúbusiness model‚Äù can survive.If AI is now coming for academics, might it come for some of these other immune jobs that Friedman talked about? Well, I actually put ChatGPT to the test by asking it to write in the style of Friedman himself. And it actually produced a perfect summary of the book I mentioned at the beginning of this piece almost exactly like it was written by the original author.‚ÄúThe world is flat, my friends! Yes, you heard it right ‚Äì flat. In this hyper-connected, digitized, and globalized era, geographical boundaries and physical distance have become irrelevant. Today, a person sitting in Mumbai can work for a company based in New York, collaborate with team members in London, and deliver results seamlessly. That‚Äôs the power of the flat world we live in,‚Äù the AI wrote in the first paragraph of a TL;DR version of Friedman‚Äôs most famous work.Read moreChatGPT, the almighty AI, is a neoliberal college graduateSome commentators have started to have fun with this. Hu Xijin of China‚Äôs Global Times tested it and generated a pretty hilarious outcome. If you are familiar with Hu‚Äôs work, then you‚Äôd know that the AI almost nailed it on the head when it took a crack at copying China‚Äôs most famous commentator‚Äôs style.After seeing this, I tried it on myself. ChatGPT described me as ‚Äúa freelance journalist who covers politics, foreign policy, and culture. He is known for his critical analysis and commentary on the United States‚Äô domestic and international affairs. Blankenship‚Äôs work often emphasizes the country‚Äôs political polarization, its role in global affairs, and its domestic social and economic issues.‚ÄùOK, that‚Äôs fair. Then I asked the program to write a column about US foreign policy in my style. And so it did. Here is the conclusion of the column:‚ÄúOverall, the US foreign policy seems to be lacking a clear and coherent strategy. It is important for the United States to engage in robust diplomacy and work with allies to address global challenges like climate change, terrorism, and economic inequality. A more thoughtful and strategic approach to foreign affairs will be critical in the years ahead if the US wishes to maintain its position as a global leader.‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre interested in comparing this to my work, feel free to click my name here on RT to see my author page or check out my columns onCGTN. While I think this reflects, generally, something I would say, I noticed that it‚Äôs definitely not as sharp as I am sometimes. For example, I don‚Äôt really care if the US maintains its position as a global leader or not. I actually wish it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì and I have said that publicly on numerous occasions. So maybe I‚Äôm safe for now and ChatGPT can‚Äôt replicate my style.It could also be that the AI doesn‚Äôt have as much to work with compared to Hu or Friedman, who have both been in the game a lot longer than yours truly. And thus it could be filling in the gaps with some internal biases, which were noted by CGTN‚Äôs senior sci-tech editor Gong Zhe, who claimed that the AI has a notable left-wing bias. His experiment with the technology produced some results that suggested a bias and he even got it to praise Joe Biden. Maybe that explains why the AI made me sound like a hippy-dippy liberal, which I will come out and state here clearly that I am not.Conservatives have criticized the chatbot for allegedly being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù on culture war issues. For instance, one conservative tried to get it to write a story about why drag queen story hour is bad for kids, to which it replied that it couldn‚Äôt on the grounds that it would be ‚Äúharmful.‚Äù But if prompted to write about why the controversial teaching technique is good, it gave a long and detailed account of a drag queen named Glitter who taught schoolchildren a valuable lesson about inclusion. It also refused to write a story about Trump beating Biden in the 2020 election, saying sternly that this event did not occur.Read moreGoogle‚Äôs AI makes mistake in first demoDespite the jabs from the right, overall, I think that ChatGPT can and will undoubtedly and convincingly pass off as some high-profile writers when prompted, which raises questions about the future of political commentary. Of course, the AI generally doesn‚Äôt produce any novel opinions or analyses, which means, as of now, it will be relegated to a knock-off. So, for now, I think us political commentators are safe.ChatGPT itself shares this opinion ‚Äì or rather, when posed the question from this article‚Äôs title, says it can‚Äôt have an opinion:‚ÄúAs an Al language model, I can analyze data and provide insights on a variety of topics, including politics. However, I don‚Äôt have personal opinions or biases, and my responses are based purely on the data and information available to me.Political commentators, on the other hand, are human beings who provide their own analysis and opinions on political events and issues. They can bring their own unique perspectives and experiences to their analysis, which can be valuable for their audiences.In summary, while I can provide information and insights on political issues, I cannot replace the role of political commentators in offering their own personal analysis and opinions.‚ÄùBut then again, it can write fiction and play pretend, so how far are we from seeing its bylines in famed outlets?The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571936-chatgpt-ai-replace-political-commentator/,2023,Feb,26

The spokesperson said the company had ‚Äúcontacted the Commission to set the record straight and explain how we protect the data of the 125 million people across the EU who come to TikTok every month.‚Äù: US lawmakers push nationwide TikTok banLast month, a group of Republican lawmakers in the US introduced the ‚ÄòNo TikTok on United States Devices Act‚Äô, which seeks to ban the platform on all devices in the country. One of the bill's authors, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), argued at the time that the app ‚Äúopens the door for the Chinese Communist Party to access Americans‚Äô personal information, keystrokes, and location through aggressive data harvesting.‚ÄùIn December 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered state agencies to ‚Äúeliminate all cybersecurity risks posed by TikTok‚Äù and prohibited the use of the app on government-provided devices. Reports at the time suggested that lawmakers and staff at the US House of Representatives had also been instructed to uninstall the app from any corporate devices.FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last year that the agency had ‚Äúnational security concerns‚Äù about TikTok, including the ‚Äúpossibility that the Chinese government could use it to control data collection on millions of users, or control the recommendation algorithm.‚ÄùCommenting on the allegations at the time, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning accused US officials of ‚Äúspreading disinformation‚Äù in a bid to discredit a large Chinese firm competing with Western social media giants.ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, also dismissed claims that it ever planned to track Americans.

Nothing lasts forever, and the pair could collapse under the sheer weight of their own ideological and geopolitical obsessions.            ByIvan Timofeev, Valdai Club Programme Director & one of Russia‚Äôs leading foreign policy experts.US President Joe Biden (R) and China's President Xi Jinping (L) meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on November 14, 2022. ¬©                SAUL LOEB  AFPModern international relations scholarship has torn itself inside out trying to define the nature of modern superpowers. What distinguishes a true claimant to the title from the rest? Is there a universal set of characteristics that distinguishes a single leader from a multitude of outsiders?Until now, the key criteria of a ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù has been considered by scholars mainly in material terms. It must have economic potential, military power, critical technologies, a developed scientific and industrial base, and human capital that far exceeds that of other countries. The sum of these material capabilities provides a non-negotiable, but measurable, criterion for ranking states.Intangible factors are much more complex. They are difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. Assessing them is too subjective and potentially biased. Whose culture is stronger? Whose ethics are correct? Whose value system is better? Such questions lead to theoretical arguments, but do little to distinguish superpowers from other actors in the international arena, and here lies one of the most important factors.We could suggest that the notable difference between a superpower and lesser peers is the existence of a systematic and coherent political philosophy of international relations. A superpower offers its own unique perspective on how the world should be structured, by what rules it should exist, what its purpose is, and why this particular country is legitimate in its role.Read moreFyodor Lukyanov: What Russia's suspension of the New START nuclear treaty means for the worldOf course, political philosophy is not just a collection of slogans and clich√©s. It is not only a pretty package or a simulation, an ideology or, indeed, a utopia. All this may be a derivative of the theme, but it should not exhaust its content. It is a specific interpretation of key political concepts in international relations ‚Äì power, authority, justice, equality and the like. Such an understanding should be based on a deep intellectual tradition and one's own practical experience, which make the arguments of the proposed doctrine convincing both for oneself and for others.Can a country represent a value based on material factors alone? Undoubtedly. A state can concentrate considerable power and live solely on the principles of realism, pursue pragmatic policies, promote its economic interests and achieve domination wherever possible. However, naked realism will sooner or later reach the limits of its legitimacy. The rule of the bayonet and the purse will be shaky without a clear understanding of why, and for what reason, it exists.Can a country have an influential political philosophy while being materially backward? Certainly. At a certain point it can be a model of stoicism or heroism, a bearer of innovative and attractive ideas. But without a solid fiscal base, these run the risk of hanging in the air and remaining as wishful thinking.It is noteworthy that there are surprisingly few countries with both material power and a political philosophy of their own. It seems that creating such a doctrine is much easier than building a missile or a nuclear bomb. Put ‚Äúclever people‚Äù in charge, process the results of their ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù, write some basic works and turn them into manuals for propagandists, and that is all! In reality, many such efforts crumble and get lost in the noise of information. A few copies remain in the hands of a few people.Must the political philosophy of a superpower be ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù? Should it be based solely on a national intellectual tradition? The answer tends to be ‚Äúno‚Äù. Exceptionally original political-philosophical doctrines with a global impact are extremely difficult to find. They are usually a mixture of universal ethical principles, categories of major political-philosophical doctrines such as liberalism, socialism or conservatism, nationally specific views and principles, and even religious doctrines such as Christianity or Islam.Read moreDmitry Trenin: One year on, here's how the Ukraine conflict is changing the world orderThere are only two countries in the world today that combine both significant material potential and their own political philosophy. They are the United States and the People's Republic of China.The political-philosophical core of the US is well known and widely reproduced at all levels ‚Äì from university monographs and textbooks to propaganda videos and social media posts. It is based on liberal principles, with their supremacy of human reason, the idea of ‚Äúfreedom from adversity"", justice as fairness, equality of opportunity within uniform rules, and derived ideas of democracy as the optimal form of government and the market as the organization of the economy. This political-philosophical code is a product of the European Enlightenment and the specific experience of organizing the internal life of European countries, which was embodied on the basis of the American political experience and multiplied by the material power of the United States. The European roots of US political philosophy make it easy for it to take root in many Western countries, even if in some places it contradicts individual interpretations ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù. Importantly, there is also a strong modernist potential in such a political philosophy, because, in general, it‚Äôs one of emancipation, liberation and rational progress.China‚Äôs political-philosophical pivot is far less known, simply because Beijing has not yet sought to actively promote it abroad. Its messaging has long remained largely nationally focused. But it is systemic, deeply reflective and has great potential beyond China's borders. It is based on the view of international relations as a non-zero-sum game, the idea of collectivity, and a departure from rivalry as the leitmotif of world politics. The strong element of Marxism in contemporary Chinese political philosophy gives it a modernist potential combined with the experience of dealing with the country‚Äôs own key problems. It combines the ideas of people's democracy with the successful experience of fighting poverty, overcoming underdevelopment and reducing social inequalities. In today's world, China appears as a country whose ideas have been tested by practice. Yes, many of its successes have been made possible by its integration into the Western-centered global economy. But here, too, China tends to follow its own philosophical line - using cooperation, borrowing Western experience and combining it with its own traditions. In effect, Marxism is a Western doctrine put at China's service.Will there be a clash of political philosophies between the US and China? Most likely yes, because Beijing is perceived in the US as a long-term threat. China avoids copying and ""mirroring"" American accusations against it by promoting the idea of playing the non-zero-sum game, thereby making its political philosophy an even more visible alternative. One could argue for a long time whether it is material factors or ideas that are primary in the contradictions between the powers. Obviously, if necessary, differences in ideas can be used for political mobilization and the consolidation of allies. The more systemic such ideas are, the easier it is to draw dividing lines.Read moreAndrey Sushentsov: Here‚Äôs why Ukraine‚Äôs Zelensky wants a long war with RussiaAre the political philosophies of the US and the PRC self-sufficient? No. Both the US and China combine their political philosophies with the principles of realism. Like many other actors, they assume the risk of worst-case scenarios and prepare for them by accumulating resources for mutual deterrence. However, political philosophy allows them to maintain or claim global legitimacy for their influence.Does Russia have a political philosophy of its own? The answer so far is it does not. Russia has returned to the principles of realism in its foreign policy, which was an achievement on its own. But it is too early to speak of a systematic and well-developed political philosophy. There are still a number of vague, sometimes contradictory ideas, concepts, interpretations and slogans derived from them. There is a clear lack of modernist potential in the Russian system of views. Its necessity may be debatable in itself, but it is clearly embedded in the US, China and in many lesser powers.Russia has recently experienced the collapse and loss of its political-philosophical project, which began to rot long before the disintegration of the USSR. Perhaps it is the Soviet experience that still causes a persistent and unconscious allergy to political philosophy. It is also possible that both the US and China will at some point face the same problem that the Soviet Union had - a disconnect between its doctrine and the real state of affairs. Perhaps freedom from political philosophy is now Russia's advantage. Maybe Russia will develop its own unique experience, which will allow it to avoid mechanically copying others' ideas and mixing them with its own practice. The maturation of political philosophy takes time, as does the cultivation of its material base.ANALYSIS                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572276-could-china-and-us-collapse/,2023,Mar,1

This will change the world                        The international sphere is aligning along two blocs, one led by the US and its allies, and the other by Beijing and Moscow            ByFyodor Lukyanov,the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club.Chinese national flags flutter at Tian'anmen Square ahead of the annual two sessions on March 3, 2023 in Beijing, China.  ¬©Getty ImagesChina has stepped up its diplomatic activity considerably. This is not only because it has broken out of the long-standing pandemic isolation that previously hampered its outreach. The main motive is that China‚Äôs role and weight in the international arena have grown to the point where contemplative detachment is no longer possible. This is an important shift in Chinese self-awareness; the question now is what changes in international practice it will lead to.Non-action as the highest virtue and the non-contradictory interpenetration of opposites are principles of traditional philosophy, but they are also quite an applied way of conducting international activities. A detailed analysis of this phenomenon should be left to specialists, but it is worth noting that the shift from such a worldview to a more familiar ideological and geopolitical confrontation took place when China adopted the generally alien Western communist doctrine.Mao Zedong attempted to change not only the social order but also the culture of the Chinese. But his reign ended with a bargain with the United States, which was a return to a strategic equilibrium that better suited the Chinese view of the world. Mutual recognition did not mean agreement and harmony, but it was in line with the objectives of the parties at the time. This period, which lasted until very recently, is only now showing signs of coming to an end.Read moreIvan Timofeev: Could China and the US eventually end up like the USSR, as collapsed superpowers?There is much debate in America about the last few decades, and there is complaining that it is China that has gained the most from the interaction. Criteria may vary, but in general it is hard to disagree that Beijing has been the primary beneficiary ‚Äì at least in terms of the transformation of the country and its place on the international stage. Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs strategy of quiet, gradual ascent was entirely in the Chinese spirit, and the result has undoubtedly been justified.So much so that it was extremely difficult for Beijing to understand that this super favorable and advantageous situation would come to an end.This proved inevitable for one simple reason: China has acquired a power that, whatever its wishes and intentions, makes it a potential rival to the US. And this has led to a natural evolution of the American approach to Beijing. After all, the US style is the direct opposite of the classic Chinese style described above. And the latter‚Äôs attempts in the late 2010s and early 2020s to slow down the growing American pressure have run up against Washington‚Äôs firm intention to move the relationship into the category of strategic competition. To be fair, China‚Äôs assertiveness and self-confidence were also growing, but if everything had depended on Beijing alone, the period of beneficial cooperation would have lasted several more years.Read moreChinese peace plan: Can Beijing find a way to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite open hostility from the US and NATO?Be that as it may, a new era has dawned.

The form of engagement so far bears the hallmarks of the previous period and of that very traditional approach ‚Äì the sterile precision of the wording of Chinese peace proposals on the Ukraine issue is evidence of this. But this too is likely to change. China‚Äôs desire to maintain an outwardly well intentioned neutrality suits Moscow; it is the West that is quick to allege insincerity, and to do so in a tone that is unbecoming of the Chinese. Beijing should not be expected to make a sharp U-turn, which is also contrary to its sense of propriety, but the direction is set.And it is not a question of whether China shares Russia‚Äôs assessment of what is happening in Ukraine. Beijing has carefully avoided expressing an opinion because it does not consider it to be its business. But the realignment of forces on the world stage is taking its course, with China and Russia, whether they like it or not, on one side and the United States and its allies on the other. And from now on this will become increasingly clear. In his ten years at the helm of his country, Xi Jinping has transformed its domestic and foreign policies.On the one hand, he has emphasized the classical Chinese outlook more than his predecessors, while on the other, he has honored the slogans and ideas associated with socialism. The former implies a self-sufficient harmony, while the latter tends to be outward-looking as much as inward-looking. This symbiosis is likely to define China‚Äôs positioning in the next five or ten years of Xi‚Äôs rule. The hostile international environment will increasingly test Beijing‚Äôs ability to maintain an acceptable equilibrium. Much will depend on how successful these attempts are, including for Russia.ANALYSIS                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572465-china-is-finally-superpower/,2023,Mar,4
China is competing in a great Asian arms race because it has no other choice ‚Äî RT World News,"        China is competing in a great Asian arms race because it has no other choice                        Beijing‚Äôs continued militarization is a forced response to US pressure. But can it keep its cool?            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystSpecial warfare reconnaissance team members conduct a field reconnaissance training in Hechi City, Guangxi Province, China, Feb. 17, 2023. ¬©                Photo credit should read CFOTOFuture Publishing via Getty ImagesDuring the two sessions of the National People‚Äôs Congress (NPC) over the weekend, China announced that its military budget would increase by 7.2% year on year. The news made headlines around the world.The Chinese premier‚Äôs work report, submitted to the NPC, says the country‚Äôs military ‚Äúshould intensify military training and preparedness across the board,‚Äù and points to escalating ‚Äúexternal attempts to suppress and contain China.‚Äù The country‚Äôs state media reacted conservatively, stressing that the defense spending increase is in keeping with the ‚Äúsingle-digit‚Äù growth pattern of recent years (7.1% in 2022, 6.8% in 2021, 6.6% in 2020).Western media took a much different angle, with many outlets making obligatory mention of warnings from analysts and officials that China‚Äôs real military spending could be much higher than the announced budget. For example the Guardian cited the US Department of Defense as claiming it could be up to two times higher. These outlets do mention that China‚Äôs defense budget is still dwarfed by that of the US ($224B versus $772B), before moving on to talk about the size of China‚Äôs navy and infantry, its ‚Äúmilitarization‚Äù of the South China Sea and, of course, repeating the warnings emanating from Washington DC that ‚ÄúChina may invade Taiwan‚Äù soon.Such warnings from the US come coupled with a string of deliberate provocations such as official visits to Taiwan, flyovers, and ‚Äòfreedom of navigation‚Äô operations. The US itself has made it a priority to militarize the region and to encircle China. None of these points can be found in Western media reports on Beijing‚Äôs defense spending ‚Äì even though they are directly responsible for continued growth in China‚Äôs military budget.Read moreSouth Korea and US respond to missile launch by PyongyangOwing to the US attempt to contain China, the Asia-Pacific is now locked in a growing arms race and military competition, and Beijing has no choice but to participate. Washington has initiated a militarization of the region, under the label of its ‚ÄúIndo-Pacific‚Äù strategy, with the focus on suppressing the rise of China. To do this, the US has created minilateral blocs targeting China, one being the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, US) and the other being AUKUS with Britain. Additionally, the US has dramatically increased its deployment of military assets in the region, has pushed the Philippines to increase access to its bases, and has also deliberately pushed the Taiwan issue and walked back from its existing commitments to China in order to escalate regional tensions.The US has actively encouraged and pushed for the arming of its regional allies too, the most notable example being Japan‚Äôs pledge to double its military spendingand to buy hundreds of cruise missiles from the US. This militarization has been complementary to the parallel expansion of sanctions and embargoes aimed at crushing China‚Äôs rise in high-end technologies, which the US sees as directly contributing to its military capabilities. In this sense, the technological and military aspects of China-US competition are intrinsically linked, all in the name of American supremacy over the region.So facing this growing military encirclement and competition, how does China respond? The answer is that it continues to develop and strengthen its military, with the optimism that it can keep up with the United States in the long term. The US military budget continues to be over three times the size of China‚Äôs, which is also sobering for those calling Beijing a ‚Äúthreat.‚Äù However, this does not mean that China is incapable, as its resources are concentrated in one region around itself, while the US is aiming for worldwide domination. When it comes to raw numbers, for example, China already has a larger navy than the United States and greater shipbuilding capacity.2023 will be a year of significantly increased tensions. It hasn‚Äôt started well, with the US kicking up a storm over an alleged Chinesespy balloon, continuing provocations around Taiwan and reviving the Covid-19lab leak theory. But will China bite? It seems unlikely.Read moreAsian ally announces more arms purchases from USOne of the primary goals of this US-led effort is precisely to provoke Beijing so that Washington might be able to induce instability and therefore increase its geopolitical clout over other countries, breaking up positive regional integration. That is why China needs to be careful.With Beijing recognizing it is facing US encirclement, it has to defend its critical national interests, but in conjunction, it also needs to play a diplomatic game to reassure other countries simultaneously. China does not want ties with India to deteriorate further, or to create anxiety for ASEAN claimants in the South China Sea, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia or the Philippines.It also wants to avoid Europe becoming more militarily involved against China, which would represent a great success for the US. China strives to be firm but also calm and cautious. There is a lot to lose in facing a hostile US, but sitting idly by is not an option. A military competition has begun, and it isn‚Äôt going away. Beijing must be strong but also avoid ‚Äúrocking the boat‚Äù too much.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572539-china-asia-arms-race/,2023,Mar,9

The top diplomat revealed that Budapest was firmly opposed to targeting the industry with restrictions, adding that several other EU countries have also backed this stance.‚ÄúWe objected very strongly to this move, and there were some other member states, not too many, but some that sided with us in this regard,‚Äù Szijjarto said, adding that some other unspecified nations eagerly backed the idea of slapping restrictions on Russia‚Äôs nuclear energy sector.Budapest has had a direct interest in exempting the industry from sanctions, given the deal with Moscow to expand its Paks Nuclear Power Plant. Halting the construction of the additional power units at the facility would greatly damage the country, Szijjarto explained.: Hungary will reject sanctions on Russian nuclear industry ‚Äì FM‚ÄúIf we are unable to proceed with the construction of the Paks II nuclear power plant, then we will largely lose the guarantee of our long-term energy security. I think that the energy sector should be completely exempted from sanctions, given the fact that energy is a physical issue that has nothing to do with politics or ideology,‚Äù the minister emphasized.Hungary has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the EU over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Budapest has argued that the restrictions have damaged the bloc‚Äôs economy itself, but failed to meaningfully impact Russia.The EU was expected to adopt its tenth package of anti-Russian sanctions by February 24 to mark the one-year anniversary of Moscow‚Äôs special military operation against Kiev. So far, however, the bloc‚Äôs member states have failed to agree on the package, struggling to find new areas of the Russian economy to target with restrictions, an issue that was acknowledged by President of the European Council Charles Michel earlier this week.

A report last year by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) found that the FBI alone made ‚Äúfewer than 3,394,053‚Äù queries of US citizens between December 2020 and November 2021, based on data obtained under Section 702.Although the law cannot be used to surveil Americans directly, it allows the US to gather intelligence on any American whom a foreign surveillance target contacts.This intelligence is stored for five years, during which it can be searched ‚Äì for example by name, phone number, or email address, by US intelligence agencies.President Joe Biden will likely face opposition from some Republicans when it comes to renewing Section 270.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said last year that Congress ‚Äúshould not even reauthorize FISA.‚Äù Allies of former president Donald Trump previously condemned the FBI for abusing the FISA process to illegally wiretap the ex-president.

This is understandable, as it affects what is commonly known as ‚Äústrategic stability,‚Äù i.e. the system of peaceful relations between the nuclear powers.However, if we try to summarize the main point of the speech, it was mostly a call for Russia to concentrate on its domestic affairs and its own development. There were no plans for the global order in the address. And the outside world in general was given a very minor focus, with a demand (to the West) not to interfere in Russian affairs, and remarks (aimed at everyone else) about opening up new markets and logistical corridors for cooperation.The pattern of relations with the Western world, as outlined in the message, is disengagement on all fronts: economic, political, financial and ethical. And this is the norm, not an anomaly. Because the Ukrainian issue is at the heart of the dispute, on which Russia and the West have diametrically opposed and irreconcilable views. It has taken a violent form and is likely to drag on for a long time. But the goal remains. And the decision on New START should be seen in this context, as should indications that a resumption of nuclear tests is not unthinkable. We shall leave the military side of the matter to the professionals (and we have brilliant specialists in this field), but this decision is primarily a political one. Let us try to look at it in more detail.Read moreDmitry Trenin: One year on, here's how the Ukraine conflict is changing the world orderThe New START Treaty, recently extended for five years (in 2021), is the latest in a series of agreements that began in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s. The final phase of the Cold War was generally a period of maximum confrontation, and the documents on missile defence and strategic arms limitation and reduction provided a framework for mutual deterrence between the nuclear superpowers. The confrontation was officially declared over at the turn of the 1990s when political, economic and ideological relations between Moscow and Washington changed.At the same time, the strategic element remained, and the existence of reduced, albeit very significant, nuclear capabilities remained the basis for building US-Russia relations. It was obvious against whom these arsenals were being deployed ‚Äì there were no other targets.Since the US announced its withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, the course for dismantling the Cold War failsafe system was generally predetermined. When the New START Treaty was drafted in a brief moment of ‚Äúreset,‚Äù many commentators noted that it was likely to be the last of its kind. Not so much because of the changing nature of contacts between Russia and the US, but because the model of bilateral agreements was ill-suited to the rapidly evolving global reality.In any case, the area of strategic stability was seen as the last opportunity to maintain a business relationship between Russia and the United States, as the main actors responsible for avoiding nuclear Armageddon. While everything else fell apart, at least here we understood each other.Read moreAndrey Sushentsov: Here‚Äôs why Ukraine‚Äôs Zelensky wants a long war with RussiaAt some point, however, this became rather illusory. And with the outbreak of an open military confrontation in 2022, maintaining the previous approach proved to be completely impossible. In general, a unique and rather dangerous situation has arisen of an acute military confrontation between two nuclear superpowers, in which one is directly involved and the other indirectly, but no less actively.What does suspension (judging by the experience of recent decades, the first step towards withdrawal) mean in practice? Naturally, experts immediately recall the pointless and extremely costly arms race of the 1970s and 1980s. But there is hope that this experience will not be repeated. Moreover, there has always been a relatively influential faction in Washington that considered all treaties unfavorable and advocated maximum freedom of arms. But in today‚Äôs international system, based as it is on asymmetric relationships and imbalances, the old mantra of parity looks a little outdated.Vladimir Putin‚Äôs statement is a deliberate indication that the conflict in Ukraine and the nuclear factor are on the same level. The mention of nuclear tests is intended to indicate the possible trajectory of further moves by Russia if the NATO and US escalation continues, a desire for which was discussed many times at the recent Munich Security Conference.The end of the era of bilateral treaties and possibly other agreements of that period (multilateral, but initiated by the USSR and the US) is hardly a cause for rejoicing. Any ‚Äúclean-up‚Äù of the international environment, and agreements by major countries on major issues which strengthen the foundations of political culture, are better than an unrestrained display of instinct. But no agreement is permanent. The old model of relations, based on the Cuban missile crisis, has expired.

But despite a temporary relaxation of restrictions on the war-torn and shaken country, problems still exist.Syrian provinces have still been left ill-prepared to deal with the scale of disaster that has befallen them and must now be given every support to reconstruct their country. According to authorities in Turkey and Syria, as many as 42,000 people have been killed by the devastating quakes, with at least 23 million people affected in total. Millions have been temporarily displaced, and many more still await news on their loved ones and whether or not they survived. The situation as it stands is an utter disaster, and the full impact is impossible to convey in mere words.In T√ºrkiye‚Äôs case, the international community‚Äôs response was unanimous; aid was pledged, teams arrived to relieve the suffering and, whatever the political frictions between Istanbul and some Western nations, a sense of universal humanitarian comradery prevailed. The Biden administration in Washington reacted to the natural disaster by pledging ‚Äúanything‚Äù that Ankara needed, while the European Union mobilized emergency response and offered its Copernicus satellite mapping service to help first responders in T√ºrkiye.However, the situation has been very different for Syria with only a few select nations quick to come to its aid. The US government stated that it would not cooperate with Damascus to deal with the carnage inside Syrian territory. The Syrian government officially requested help from the EU, which some EU states instantly refused to provide. The United Kingdom quickly came to the aid of their NATO ally T√ºrkiye, but refused help to the suffering Syrians, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky tweeted his condolences to T√ºrkiye and its people in Turkish but failed to acknowledge Syria at all. Syrians were not in the spotlight to receive help from the West and are actively being ignored in spite of the gravity of the situation facing them.Read moreWestern sanctions will mean that more Syrians die after the earthquakesCompounding the difficulties is a plethora of sanctions against the Damascus government, which were applied by the EU, the UK and the US. The worst of these are perhaps the 2019 Caesar Act sanctions, which have severely crippled Syria‚Äôs post-war economy and robbed the nation of the ability to reconstruct.The US sanctions have indeed been amended for a short period, to allow relief aid to travel into Syria, but the problem with the sanctions is not just that they hindered aid from entering the country for days.The dire economic situation across Syria‚Äôs provinces, a problem preceding the current crisis, has undermined the medical sector‚Äôs capacity to deal with the sheer number of dead and injured following an earthquake of this magnitude. According to a number of UN experts, the sanctions imposed upon Syria were already causing a humanitarian crisis and should be lifted.‚ÄúWith more than half of the vital infrastructure either completely destroyed or severely damaged, the imposition of unilateral sanctions on key economic sectors, including oil, gas, electricity, trade, construction and engineering have quashed national income, and undermine efforts towards economic recovery and reconstruction,‚Äù Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on unilateral coercive measures and human rights, said last year.The UN has directly linked Syria‚Äôs current cholera epidemic to Western sanctions, which have prevented rehabilitation and development of water distribution networks at a time when 12 million Syrians grapple with food insecurity.According to on-the-ground accounts, during the first few days following the earthquake, there was not enough fuel to transport aid and rescue teams to affected areas quickly. In Syrian government-held areas, electricity only runs for a few hours per day under normal circumstances. Now, given the masses of displaced families, people are suffering in sub-zero temperatures at night.Exacerbating the issues is that while Syria is rich in natural gas and oil, the US military, along with its proxy forces in the northeast of the country, occupies a third of Syria‚Äôs territory, including its oil and gas fields. The most fertile agricultural lands have also been stolen from the Syrian people by US occupation, which was never granted congressional approval back in Washington. Piling onto that pressure, Israel also used the earthquake as an opportunity to claim that the Syrian government had requested aid from it, knowing this would reflect poorly on Damascus. The Syrian government denies this, and although Israel claims the aid would be directed to Syria, it was only sent to T√ºrkiye.Read moreEconomic toll of T√ºrkiye earthquakes estimatedThat the US State Department amended its sanctions is a tacit admission that they had prevented aid reaching Syria and that Washington is cognizant of this fact. Efforts to deny that sanctions impeded foreign nations from sending aid to those suffering, for example in The Washington Post are deceptive and done in poor faith.According to Aron Lund, a fellow with the New York-based think tank Century International, although the sanctions do not technically forbid aid, the reality on the ground is something completely different. Banks often block transfers that are supposed to pay suppliers or local aid workers for fear of breaking sanctions rules, Lund observed, as quoted by the Associated Press. Additionally, the sanctions actually target reconstruction inside Syria, which means that they will block rebuilding efforts, whether the destruction resulted from the 12-year-long war or from the earthquake.Out of Syria‚Äôs four primary border crossings, for years only the Bab al-Hawa crossing into the Idlib province was given a mandate by the UN for delivering aid to Syria. Idlib is controlled jointly between Turkish forces in the north and al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whereas the Syrian government does not have direct territorial access to the crossing and most countries refuse to use the Damascus International Airport to send aid.On top of this, the sole border crossing was severely damaged by the earthquake, depriving roughly 4 million Syrians of aid they depend on. Recently, Syrian President Bashar Assad offered support to civilians living inside the Idlib province, help that was rejected by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Syrian leader also permitted the opening of two additional crossings into Idlib, a move commended by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.The story that is unfolding in front of our eyes is one of bitter and selfish Western governments that put their obsession for regional hegemony above humanitarian issues. What happened to Syria and T√ºrkiye should not be politicized and should not result in the deaths of those who are not in any way involved.The sanctions on Syria have killed innocent civilians, and the inaction of the West in aiding the Syrian people at this time is tantamount to abandoning those who could have been saved. If we now know that the sanctions block aid, why is it acceptable that the US only temporarily freeze them? They should not be in place at all, and neither should US forces occupy Syrian territory.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571653-syria-earthquake-us-led-economic/,2023,Feb,18

To this end, Keane stated that Washington should increase weapons production as well as double down on arming Taipei.: Taiwan issues China warningAccording to the retired general, another important task for the US is to ensure that regional powers such as Australia, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines are on board in case Washington faces off with Beijing militarily.Addressing the delegates of China‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress last Sunday, outgoing Premier Li Keqiang emphasized Beijing‚Äôs determination to ‚Äúadvance the process of China‚Äôs peaceful reunification‚Äù while taking resolute steps to oppose Taiwanese independence.The official also announced a 7.2% boost in China‚Äôs defense spending, taking it to some $230 billion.In recent years, senior Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, have repeatedly asserted that military options are not off the table regarding Taiwan.Taiwan has been de facto independent since 1949, when the losing side in the Chinese civil war fled to the island and established its own administration. While most countries, including the US, profess to abide by the ‚ÄòOne China‚Äô principle and do not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, the self-governing island has long enjoyed close ties with Washington.China considers Taiwan an inalienable part of its territory which is temporarily occupied by separatists.

He also spoke of a recent visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp, which apparently convinced him to issue an open call to ensure that tragedies such as the Holocaust never happen again.‚ÄúNazis? Losers,‚Äù the Austrian-American actor said. ‚ÄúThe confederacy? Losers. The apartheid movement?

This study should be and can only be conducted jointly by scientists around the world,‚Äù Mao told reporters on Monday, adding that the US government has only hampered those efforts by ‚Äúpoliticizing, weaponizing and instrumentalizing the issue.‚ÄùWe hope the WHO Secretariat will take a science-based, objective and just position, not let politicization get in the way, and carry out the origins-tracing study in the US, among other countries, and play a positive role in science-based global origins-tracing.Mao‚Äôs remarks came days after FBI Director Christopher Wray claimed the virus ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù originated in a leak from a Chinese lab in comments to Fox News, citing a bureau assessment that has not been made public. The Department of Energy has also reportedly altered its stance on the matter, recently endorsing the lab-leak theory, though only with ‚Äúlow confidence.‚ÄùThe Foreign Ministry spokesperson accused Washington of ‚Äúspreading myths‚Äù without ‚Äúsupporting evidence,‚Äù saying the allegations have only ‚Äúpoisoned the atmosphere for science-based global origins-tracing.‚Äù She noted the WHO had already visited China on two occasions to probe the issue and concluded the leak hypothesis was ‚Äúextremely unlikely,‚Äù but said no similar investigation had been carried out in the US.‚ÄúThe US, however, ignored these science-based conclusions and recommendations and kept pressurizing WHO into repeatedly demanding origins-tracing in China. It is quite clear what the US is trying to achieve,‚Äù Mao continued. ‚ÄúWhile claiming to take origins-tracing seriously, the US has never invited WHO expert groups to the US for joint study, or shared any early data. Instead, it has turned a blind eye to the world‚Äôs concerns about US bio-military bases at Fort Detrick and around the world.‚Äù:    WHO wants proof  to support US claims of Covid originBeijing has repeatedly sounded alarms over military sitesincluding Fort Detrick in Maryland, which houses the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) ‚Äì the Pentagon‚Äôs primary bioweapons research program.

The 2003 invasion led to the death of between 180,000 to 210,000 civilians, according to the Iraq Body Count project, while the instability caused by the toppling of the Iraqi government and the withdrawal of US forces in 2011 ultimately led to the rise of Islamic State, ISIS and ISIL.US troops returned to the country in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government to combat ISIS. However, after the terrorist group was mostly suppressed, the US decided to keep 2,500 of its troops stationed in Iraq and 900 in Syria.That‚Äôs despite the Iraqi parliament voting to expel all foreign troops after the US assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020.

According to the suit, he assumed the feature would work ‚Äúwithout regard to skin tone,‚Äù as Apple disclosed no ‚Äúbiases and defects‚Äù on the label.But pulse oximeters have been shown in scientific studies to produce inaccurate measurements for darker-complexioned patients, due to the melanin in their skin absorbing the infrared light from the device as if it was well-saturated blood.

Compounding what Deputy Inspector General Sheldon Shoemaker of the Small Business Administration (SBA) called ‚Äúthe biggest fraud in a generation,‚Äù the officials stressed that the figures they gave represented an extremely conservative estimate of the total amount lost as they did not include the amount defrauded from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.According to a statement submitted by Shoemaker ahead of the hearing,the SBA has already uncovered $190.7 billion in potential fraud across relief programs under its jurisdiction. Specifically, it expectsto find upwards of $100 billion within the scandal-plagued Paycheck Protection Program. Acting Treasury Inspector General Richard Delmar admitted to just $2.6 billion in dubious charges confirmed at his agency, pleading that ongoing audits precluded making an estimate of the full cost.Read moreWatchdog finds $5.4 billion in potential Covid loan fraudLarry Turner, inspector general of the Department of Labor, blamed the massive losses on a lack of preparation, insufficient oversight, and even the government‚Äôs generosity, making a ‚Äúhighly conservative‚Äù estimate of $76 billion in fraudulent spending. With no functioning system in place to verify applicants‚Äô qualifying details in a reasonable time frame, the ‚Äúunprecedented infusion of federal funds‚Äù into the program made it irresistible to fraudsters, he told the subcommittee.Rep. Keith Mfume (D-Maryland) expressed shock that no one had predicted that requiring only ‚Äúself-certification‚Äù to access such a prodigious cash hoard would lead to ‚Äúa lot of hanky-panky,‚Äù while Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Florida) pointed out that the agencies did not even use existing checks and balances to vet applicants, and Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Florida) highlighted that state unemployment systems were hopelessly outdated even before the pandemic placed them under unprecedented stress. Of $45.6 billion in potential fraud lent out in association with one Labor Department program, Turner acknowledged upon questioning that $267 million had gone to dead people.Asked about the possibility of recovering the money, Turner said that hunting down the perpetrators was financially unrewarding, as ‚Äúonce money goes out the door, it is hard to get it back.‚Äù Even in cases where the government has been able to track down Covid-19 benefit fraudsters and claw back some of the funds, the inspectors general were unable to tell subcommittee members what had become of some of the money. More than $5 trillion in pandemic relief funds have been distributed since 2020. By some estimates, as much as $400 billion was stolen from the unemployment relief program alone.

Goodbye empire? US sanctions are failing in the face of multipolarity ‚Äî RT World News,"        Goodbye empire? US sanctions are failing in the face of multipolarity                        Washington‚Äôs go-to methods can‚Äôt prevent the rise of other powers, an influential establishment journal admits            ByFelix LivshitzFILE - Russia's President Vladimir Putin, right, reviews a military honor guard with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a welcoming ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, June 8, 2018. ¬©                Greg BakerPool Photo via AP, FileForeign Affairs, a highly influential US magazine ‚Äì effectively a US empire house journal ‚Äì has published an article detailing how sanctions are quickly losing their efficiency as a weapon in Washington‚Äôs global arsenal.Published by the Council on Foreign Relations NGO, Foreign Affairs provides space for officials within the US military industrial complex to communicate with one another on matters they believe to be of the utmost significance. Therefore, it is important to pay attention when the magazine makes major pronouncements on any issue.It recently published an appraisal of US sanctions ‚Äì the conclusion being that they are increasingly ineffective, have prompted Beijing and Moscow to create alternative global financial structures to insulate themselves and others from punitive actions, and that Washington and its acolytes will no longer be able to force countries to do their bidding, let alone destroy dissenting states, through such measures in the very near future.The article begins by noting that ‚Äúsanctions have long been the US‚Äô favored diplomatic weapon,‚Äù which ‚Äúfill the void between empty diplomatic declarations and deadly military interventions.‚Äù Despite this, it predicts ‚Äúthe golden days of US sanctions may soon be over.‚ÄùThese ‚Äúgolden days‚Äù were the immediate post-Cold War era, when Washington was ‚Äústill an unrivaled economic power,‚Äù and therefore could at the press of a button cripple each and every overseas economy, in theory. This was due to ‚Äúprimacy of the US dollar and the reach of US oversight of global financial channels.‚Äù As international trade was overwhelmingly conducted using dollars, Washington could stop any country from exporting or importing any and all goods it wished, whenever it liked. Even then, Foreign Affairs recalls, US leaders themselves worried if sanctions were applied too liberally. In 1998, then-President Bill Clinton claimed his government was ‚Äúin danger of looking like we want to sanction everybody who disagrees with us.‚ÄùRead moreEU looks for targets in tenth round of anti-Russia sanctionsThe Foreign Affairs article saysClinton‚Äôs fearswere‚Äúoverblown,‚Äù but this is precisely what came to pass. Governments, and the countries they represented,have been sanctioned for pursuing the wrong policies, refusing to be overthrown in US-backed coups and military interventions and showing any degree of independence in their domestic or foreign dealings whatsoever. In the process, millions have died, and even more lives have been ruined for no good reason.This approach has backfired, and badly. In response, states ‚Äúhave begun to harden their economies against such measures.‚Äù For example, after the US cut off Iran from the SWIFT global banking system, many other countries took note. Restricting China‚Äôs access to numerous technologies as part of the new Cold War has also served to place both Washington‚Äôs allies and adversaries alike ‚Äúon notice their access to crucial technology could be severed.‚ÄùBeijing and Moscow lead the way in the push to create ‚Äúfinancial innovations that diminish US advantage,‚Äù creating a raft of ‚Äúcurrency swap agreements, alternatives to SWIFT, and digital currencies‚Äù that serve as ‚Äúpreemptive measures‚Äù against any ‚Äúpotential penalties‚Äùdown the line.Currency swaps, which connect central banks directly to each other and eliminate the need for trades between them to be dollar-backed, have been eagerly embraced by China. It has signed deals of this kind with more than 60 countries across the world, thereby enabling its companies ‚Äúto circumvent US financial channels when they want to.‚ÄùIn 2020, Beijing settled more than half its annual trade with Moscow in currencies other than the dollar, making the majority of these transactions totally immune to US sanctions, and that figure has only risen ever since. In March that year also, the China and Russia-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization officially prioritized development of payments in the local currencies of its members.Read moreEU threatens to widen sanctionsBeijing and Moscow are also, Foreign Affairs reports, ‚Äúbusily preparing their own alternatives‚Äùto various Western-dominated international systems. Their alternative to SWIFT, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, isn‚Äôt yet a match in terms of transaction volume, but that‚Äôs not the point. It prevents them, and any state or organization enrolled in the framework ‚Äì 1,300 banks in over 100 countries already ‚Äì from being unable to make international financial transactions, should they be cut out of SWIFT.Similarly, China is expanding the reach of the digital renminbi, the currency issued by Beijing central bank, at home and overseas. More than 300 million of its citizens already use it, and a billion are forecast to by 2030. The currency is completely sanctions-proof as the US has no ability to prevent its use, and Beijing has encouraged several countries to pay for its exports exclusively using it ‚Äì ‚Äúother such deals will probably follow,‚Äù Foreign Affairs predicts.The American empire‚Äôs obsessive reliance on sanctions has now created a Catch-22 situation, by the magazine‚Äôs reckoning. The already hostile relations between the USA, China and Russia mean Moscow and Beijing are pushing ahead with this revolutionary effort no matter what. If ‚Äúthings get worse,‚Äù they‚Äôll simply ‚Äúdouble down on their sanctions-proofing efforts,‚Äù taking more and more countries with them.‚ÄúThese innovations are increasingly giving countries the ability to conduct transactions through sanctions-proof channels. This trend appears irreversible,‚Äù the articlebitterly concludes. ‚ÄúAll this means that within a decade, US unilateral sanctions may have little bite.‚ÄùIt is all these developments, along with Moscow‚Äôs economic pivot eastwards after the 2014 Ukraine coup, and move towards self-sufficiency in energy and food and in other vital resources, which account for the embarrassing failure of US-led sanctions against Russia.Western leaders, academics, journalists, pundits and economists promised when these sanctions were imposed that they would soon lead to Russia‚Äôs total political, economic and military collapse. They have not, demonstrating that elites in Europe and North America do not understand the global economy they claim to rule. They should get to grips with the new reality they inhabit in short order, though ‚Äì for a multipolar world has begun to emerge in 2022, and it is here to stay.Read moreEffect of EU sanctions on Moscow is ‚Äòless than zero‚Äô ‚Äì MEPHow rapidly US elites are reckoning with the radically different reality in which they are now forced to operate is ironically underlined by how quickly the author of the Foreign Affairs article, Agathe Demarais, seems to have completely changed her tune on the subject of sanctions. On 1 December, less than a month earlier, she authored a piece for Foreign Policy ‚Äì another US empire in-house journal ‚Äì that offered a radically different take on the matter.Boldly declaring ‚Äúsanctions on Russia are working‚Äù in the headline, Demarais dismissed suggestions punitive Western measures were intended to ‚Äúforce Putin to back down and pull out of Ukraine,‚Äù or to provoke ‚Äúregime change‚Äù in Moscow, or to prompt ‚Äúa Venezuela-style collapse of the Russian economy,‚Äù despite the fact every single one of these outcomes was explicitly cited as a motivating factor behind the sanctions by Western officials, pundits, and journalists at the time.Instead, she argued, sanctions were effective in the quest to ‚Äúsend a message to the Kremlin‚Äù that ‚ÄúEurope and the United States are standing with Ukraine.‚Äù Whether or not Kiev will be thrown under a bus by its Western backers in due course, and the anti-Russian measures will endure after the war is over, seems to not matter so much, though ‚Äì for, as Demarais was herself forced to acknowledge less than four weeks later, the effectiveness of sanctions is rapidly diminishing. This speed of this about-face could well be an indication of how irresistibly the multipolar world is coming to be.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/569926-us-sanctions-not-work/,2023,Jan,25

And tonight, I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country, your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation‚Äù ‚Äì this promise was made exactly 20 years ago, on January 28, 2003, by then US President George W. Bush in his annual message to Congress. This speech concerning Iraqi President Saddam Hussein became a prologue to the beginning of a large-scale and protracted military conflict, whose consequences the region is still dealing with today.Unfounded accusations that Iraq might be developing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) became the main pretext for the invasion which started on March 20. Less than a year later, Washington admitted that it had been a false threat, but there was no turning back ‚Äî Hussein was deposed and then executed. And the US occupied Iraq, plunging the country into chaos it is still struggling to overcome to this day.‚ÄòSo, what‚Äôs the difference?‚Äù‚Äì was how Bush reacted in December of 2003 to a remark that pointed out that WMDshad not been found in Iraq.According to Pentagon data from 2019, total losses of American servicemen during the entire Iraqi war amounted to 4,487 people. While the exact number of civilian deaths is incalculable, it is definitely measured in the hundreds of thousands.Read moreThe Kiev Purge: What has spurred a wave of resignations among senior Ukrainian officials?‚ÄúThis war has dealt a huge reputational blow to the United States. All their opponents now use this as an example of how it‚Äôs possible to bypass international law to carry out interventions in other countries without reason or pretext. It has also complicated the United States‚Äô relations with its European allies and damaged Washington‚Äôs reputation in many non-Western countries around the world,‚Äù Malek Dudakov,a political scientist specializing in the US, said, explaining the consequences of the decision taken in March of 2003.My Enemy‚Äôs Enemy is My FriendAmerica‚Äôs accusations against Hussein fell on fertile ground ‚Äì and by the beginning of 2003, the Iraqi leader‚Äôs reputation had already been hopelessly damaged by his behavior in previous conflicts. During the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988, a gas attack carried out by the Iraqi army in the city of Halabja killed up to 5,000 people, mainly Kurds. During the eight years of the war, Iran‚Äôs direct losses from chemical weapons alone amounted to at least 20,000 people. That number increased significantly after the hostilities ended, as the long-term effects of the chemical reagent took their toll.However, at that time, the United States turned a blind eye to Hussein‚Äôs atrocities, to put it mildly, since Washington recognized Iran, where the Islamic Revolution had taken place in 1979, as a much more dangerous enemy. Therefore, fully aware that the attack had been carried out by Iraq, the United States chose to lay blame on the Iranians for the tragedy in Halabja, as Joost Hilterman pointed out in an article for the New York Times.                   FILE PHOTO: Saddam Hussein welcomes his people In Baghdad, Iraq On October 17, 1983.     ¬© Pierre PERRIN  Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images                                                        In the early years of that war, Washington generally acted as a full-fledged ally of Baghdad. Citing intelligence officials and the State Department, the New York Times reported that Ronald Reagan‚Äôs administration had secretly provided Iraq with highly classified intelligence data in the spring of 1982, and had also allowed US allies to sell American weapons to help Hussein.Washington‚Äôs attitude towards the Iraqi dictator changed because of the Gulf War, which began with Iraq‚Äôs invasion of oil-rich Kuwait in August of 1990. On November 29 of that year, after numerous attempts failed to persuade Baghdad to settle the crisis peacefully, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution No. 678, which gave Hussein‚Äôs government a month and a half to end the occupation. When he refused to do so, the US-led Multinational Forces Coalition (MNF) conducted Operation Desert Storm, which liberated Kuwait after a long air offensive. It is noteworthy that this conflict was the first after the end of the Cold War in which the Soviet Union diplomatically supported the United States.Read moreNATO's best tanks are going to Ukraine, what will it mean on the battlefield?Interestingly, in 1991, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, argued with the head of the Pentagon, Dick Cheney, whose associates were already calling for the overthrow of Hussein. However, President George H.W. Bush did not dare embark on such an adventure at that time.After the conclusion of Desert Storm, the UN demanded that Iraq destroy its stocks of weapons of mass destruction, as well as their production programs, and provide proof that it had done so to its inspectors. Though Baghdad accepted these resolutions, it did not fulfill all of their requirements in practice. In 1998, Saddam Hussein completely closed inspectors‚Äô access to the country, accusing them of ‚Äòespionage‚Äô.However, in 2002, under pressure from the UN and Western countries, the President of Iraq unexpectedly agreed to an inspection. The report from the head of the IAEA, Mohammed ElBaradei, concluded that no signs of prohibited activities or any evidence of Baghdad‚Äôs resumption of a nuclear weapons program had been found during inspections at Iraqi facilities. The head of the commission, Hans Blix, expressed less confidence in this findings, but could provide no proof to contradict it. In fact, the only infraction was noted in a document on the Iraqi Air Force, which stated that Iraq had failed to destroy about 6,000 chemical rockets.The conclusions of international inspections did not matter much to the United States, led by President George W. Bush.                   FILE PHOTO: US President George W.

However, at that time, the American leader devoted only one paragraph to Iraq.‚ÄúIraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens ‚Äì leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections ‚Äì then kicked out the inspectors,‚Äù Bush said.Read moreMARIUPOL IN PHOTOS: How the battle-scarred city has changed after eight months under Russian controlIn October of 2002, Congress gave the president the green light to use armed forces in Iraq. Here, in addition to arguments concerning biological weapons, accounts of the Iraqi regime‚Äôs crackdowns came in very handy. Allegations that Hussein allegedly maintained close ties with Al-Qaeda also came into play, though the latest data from US authorities found no proof of this.As Malek Dudakov noted in a conversation with RT, by that time, the American establishment viewed Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi government as an absolute evil. The Iraqi leader was repeatedly compared to Hitler, and there were multiple leaks to the press alleging that he had weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.‚ÄúThe presidential administration actively promoted all these fears, trying to maintain Bush‚Äôs approval ratings, as well as the patriotic fervor that had been prevalent since September 11. After those terrorist attacks, America needed some obvious opponent, as the concept of ‚Äúinternational terrorism‚Äù seemed somehow abstract and incomprehensible. Plus, the early successes in the Afghan operation may have gone to the White House‚Äôs head. It seemed to them that they could quickly and bloodlessly carry out the Iraqi campaign, overthrow Hussein, and reformat the Middle East for themselves. This would weaken Iran‚Äôs position, while simultaneously giving them control over oil reserves that were of no small importance to the United States. Taken together, all these reasons compelled Washington to get involved in this adventure,‚Äù Dudakov says.The aforementioned Dick Cheney, who served as vice president in the administration of President G.W. Bush, is believed to have been one of the main shadow architects of the war in Iraq. In between working in government positions, he had served as Chief Executive Officer of the Halliburton oilfield services company, which later received the first contract for restoring and developing oil fields in occupied Iraq.

Allusions to the UN were spun to fit the American administration‚Äôs agenda ‚Äì the emphasis was put on the doubts that Blix had voiced, and, in essence, Hussein was already presumed guilty. ‚ÄúHe has given no evidence that he has destroyed it [weapons of mass destruction],‚Äù Bush said several times.The president cited US intelligence data, according to which Saddam Hussein had up to 30,000 munitions capable of using chemical reagents. Shortly before that, experts had only discovered 16, and Bush claimed, Iraq ‚Äúhas not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions.‚ÄùIn making his accusations, the American leader also referred to the British government, according to which Iraq was searching for uranium in Africa, as well as three Iraqi defectors who alleged that the government had several mobile biological weapons in the late 1990s.Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide.‚ÄùBush also referred to UN Security Council Resolution 1441 of 2002, which he said had provided Iraq with ‚Äúthe last opportunity to fulfill its disarmament obligations.‚Äù Though this document specified no automatic consequences for its non-fulfillment, the White House nevertheless had high hopes for the UN Security Council meeting that Bush announced, at which Secretary of State Colin Powell was set to speak. Subsequently, it was learned that, five days earlier, Bush had held a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, where he said that the US was ready to ‚Äútwist the UN‚Äôs arm‚Äù to get a resolution approved to launch an invasion.

And, according to Powell, the 8,500 liters of anthrax that Baghdad had admitted to possessing in 1995 was a gross underestimate.To hammer home the danger posed by Hussein‚Äôs regime, Powell showed his colleagues a test tube containing a white powder. While he didn‚Äôt claim that this substance was dangerous, he said that he wanted to show the quantity of anthrax spores mailed to two senators in 2001, which had been enough to shut down Congress.‚ÄúThe Iraqis have never accounted for all of the biological weapons they admitted they had, and we know they had... In fact, they can produce enough dry biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. And dry agent of this type is the most lethal form for human beings,‚Äù the head of the State Department stated, trying his best to scare all those present.As it turned out after the invasion, the CIA‚Äôs intelligence on the presence of mobile manufacturing labs for biological weapons in pre-war Iraq was false. After this was made public, Powell said several times that he regretted that speech, but did not feel guilty.I didn‚Äôt lie. I didn‚Äôt know it was not true.‚Äù‚ÄúI was secretary of state, not the director of intelligence,‚Äù he explained in an interview in 2005, a few months after he was asked to leave the administration of George W. Bush.Yuri Rogulev, director of the Franklin Roosevelt Foundation for the Study of the USA at Moscow State University, noted in a comment to RT that the false assurances given by Americans regarding the state of affairs in Iraq was far from the first such case in history.

For example, there was the invented second incident in the Gulf of Tonkin, after which the Vietnam War began, and the United States has invaded Panama, Grenada, and other countries under various pretexts. The only thing that was unique in the run up to the invasion of Iraq was the accusations about weapons of mass destruction. The fact that the US made a unilateral decision on Iraq was hugely significant for the world order in many respects. Although Congress gave its permission, there was strong opposition even inside the United States. The UN had not granted the US permission to invade Iraq. Even America‚Äôs closest NATO allies, Germany and France, opposed. But the United States took this step anyway, openly demonstrating that they were ready to do as they saw fit, regardless of other opinions,‚Äù Rogulev concluded.Read moreThe Last UN War: Why peacekeepers were sent to Somalia 30 years ago and how the operation's legacy still haunts policymakersLast AttemptOn the eve of the UN Security Council meeting on March 10, it became clear that the majority of its members still opposed any resolution leading to war. But this could not stop Washington. Russia nevertheless made one last desperate attempt to prevent the war.On March 18, 2003, State Duma deputy and former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov urgently flew to Baghdad by order of President Vladimir Putin. He offered Hussein the opportunity to voluntarily resign from the post of president, explaining that, otherwise, a catastrophe was inevitable.‚ÄúI told him [Hussein] the following: ‚ÄòIf you love your country and your people, if you want to protect your people from becoming inevitable victims, you must resign as president of Iraq,‚Äô‚Äù Primakov told journalists. In response, the Iraqi leader said that he‚Äôd also been persuaded to resign during the first Gulf War, but the war turned out to be inevitable anyway. ‚ÄúAfter that, he patted me on the shoulder and left,‚Äù Primakov said. Russia‚Äôs representative also stressed that Iraq ‚Äúneeds to do everything to facilitate the work of international inspectors.‚Äù According to Primakov, after this conversation, Iraq really began to destroy the banned missiles that it had previously refused to eliminate.But on March 20, without the sanction of the UN Security Council, the Americans began, as Bush put it, ‚Äúa military operation to disarm Iraq, liberate the Iraqi people, and protect the whole world from serious danger.‚Äù The operation began with air strikes on Baghdad.

However, subsequent evidence pointed to the virus spreading in other areas of China as early as October 2019, before the first Wuhan cases were detected‚Äì and researchers believe some cases also occurred in Europe and the US in the last months of 2019.A recent investigation by the US Department of Energy concluded the virus may have been ‚Äúleaked‚Äù from a Chinese lab.

Some 17 million mink were preemptively exterminated in Denmark in 2020 after some were found to be infected with a new strain of the virus thought to menace humans, a decision later determined to be illegal.Last year, Hong Kong ordered the culling of 2,000 imported hamsters after a resident‚Äôs Covid-19 infection was traced to his handling them in a pet shop; a ban on owning foreign hamsters was only lifted in January.And it was recently revealed that the UK government nearly ordered the mass extermination of residents‚Äô pet cats in order to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù after a Siamese was found to have contracted the virus in 2020, despite next to nothing being known about how the disease was transmitted between species.

Covid-19 remained the number three cause, with its death rate surging 22% to 104.1 per 100,000 people.

Overdose deaths climbed 16% last year to 107,000, nearly double the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. This has been driven by fentanyl and other opioids.Overall death rates rose most sharply among young people.

It compared the plan to the strategy long used to combat the flu.: Judge rules FDA can‚Äôt keep vaccine docs secret ‚Äòuntil 2096‚Äô‚ÄúSimilar to the approach with influenza, the global nature of SARS-CoV-2 strain evolution warrants a global response when evaluating and recommending vaccine strain composition changes,‚Äù the committee said, adding that an assessment of Covid-19 variants should be performed ahead of the fall season each year.Transitioning to annual shots with uniform composition could help to boost vaccine coverage and compliance, as well as facilitate ‚Äúclearer communication‚Äù with the public and reduce ‚Äúvaccine administration errors,‚Äù the documents continued. The advisors noted that higher-risk individuals, such as the elderly or those with compromised immune systems, may require two doses annually, but said ‚Äúmost individuals‚Äù will need only one.However, some FDA advisors remain unconvinced about the agency‚Äôs plans and say they are backed by ‚Äúlittle research,‚Äù with officials voicing doubts in comments to the New York Times.‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see some data on the effect of dosing interval, at least observational data.

The two men, who are both residents of Kansas, also allegedly provided unlicensed repair services for Russian aircraft electronics, including a computer processor bearing a sticker from Moscow‚Äôs Federal Security Service (FSB).The allegations stretch back to at least 2020 and typically involved relaying packages through third-party countries.

This was an attack on European infrastructure, on its energy security, and on the environment, too, as large amounts of natural gas leaked into the Baltic Sea.The immediate argument from the Western political-media class was that Moscow had likely attacked its own pipelines despite Nord Stream being an important source of revenue and influence. Instead of presenting evidence or any coherent motivation, they claimed it was part of the mythical ‚ÄúRussian playbook.‚ÄùAcross the West it was deemed to be conspiracy-theory peddling, and Russian propaganda, to even suggest the US would benefit from the situation. In an ultimate display of bloc discipline, or of Stockholm syndrome, the Americans were able to celebrate the destruction of the pipeline while the Western Europeans fervently denounced any allegation against their ally as disinformation. The incident has seemingly gone down the memory hole as the political-media class have no interest in an open investigation and public awareness has been diluted.Seymour Hersh, the investigative journalist who exposed the 1968 US My Lai massacre coverup in Vietnam and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq circa 2004, has now released a report blaming the US for the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. Will the report result in according the attack the serious debate and investigation it deserves, or will they attempt to move along by denouncing Hersh as an old, senile ‚ÄúPutinist?‚ÄùRead moreTop Russian security official comments on Nord Stream blast reportUS interest in destroying Nord Stream 2America‚Äôs historical fears about economic integration between Germany and Russia were realized with the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, which sent energy directly between the two European giants. The US was remarkably open about its desire and intention to disrupt the German-Russian pipeline project. Washington resisted the construction of Nord Stream 2 for years, condemned Germany for its participation, and even sanctioned European companies which participated in the project.The RAND Corporation published a report in 2019, ordered by the US Army, on how to extend and weaken Russia. Energy cooperation between Berlin and Moscow was identified as a key source of Russian economic revenue and influence in Europe, and the reportadvocated that ‚ÄúA first step would involve stopping Nord Stream 2.‚Äù In July 2020, then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeowarned:We will do everything we can to make sure that that pipeline doesn‚Äôt threaten Europe.‚ÄùThe Nord Stream pipeline was frequently threatened as the conflict in Ukraine intensified.

On 14 January 2022, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivanasserted: ‚ÄúWe have made clear to the Russians that pipeline is at risk if they move further into Ukraine.‚Äù On 3 February, Senator Ted Cruzcalled for the end of Nord Stream: ‚ÄúThis pipeline must be stopped and the only way to prevent its completion is to use all the tools available to do that.‚ÄùRead moreSnowden comments on Nord Stream revelationsOn 7 February 2022, President Biden stood next to German Chancellor Scholz as hewarned that if Russia invades Ukraine then ‚Äúthere will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.

Undersecretary of State for Policy, Victoria Nuland, alsorepeated the threat: ‚ÄúI want to be very clear: if Russia invades Ukraine one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.‚ÄùOn 26 September 2022 the threat seemingly materialized as the German-Russian Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed in an underwater explosion. The next day, on 27 September 2022, leaders from Poland, Norway, and Denmark attended a ceremony in Poland to mark the opening of the new Norway-Poland Baltic Pipe that would replace the dependence on Nord Stream.After the Nord Stream attack, former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski tweeted ‚ÄúThank you, USA,‚Äù accompanied by a picture of the destroyed pipeline. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken then, in no uncertain terms, argued that the destruction of Nord Stream presents ‚Äúa tremendous opportunity. It‚Äôs a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy.‚Äù Blinken also offered to assist Western Europe by replacing Russian gas with much more expensive American fuel. Recently, Nuland also weighed in as sheargued‚ÄúI am, and I think the Administration is, very gratified to know that Nord Stream 2 is now, as you like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea.‚ÄùRead moreWhite House responds to new Nord Stream investigationInvestigating the attackThe US has rejected any involvement in the destruction of Nord Stream, and instead pointed the finger toward Moscow as the likely culprit.

A US nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance was using funding from the US National Institutes of Health to research bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Critics have suggested this research amounted to a dangerous ‚Äúgain-of-function‚Äù manipulation of the virus, which EcoHealth and NIH have denied.Read moreWhite House distances itself from Covid ‚Äòlab-leak‚Äô theoryAlmost three years since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, the question of where the virus arose and how remains unresolved. The natural origin hypothesis is that the virus evolved in animals and crossed to humans somehow.

We are probably in the initial phase of this conflict, and more players will become involved over time, but some conclusions can already be drawn.The past year has been one in which postmodernism collided with the real world. Almost all of the direct and indirect actors in the Ukrainian crisis built their domestic and foreign policies on theoretical, highly ideological constructions. And the more the wishful thinking, the tougher the consequences now.Let's take a look at the main players.RussiaOur first and foremost illusion was about the contractual commitments of other parties. All through the post-Soviet era we had tried to resolve the Ukraine issue peacefully on the assumption that this would be better for all.Read moreIvan Timofeev: In 2022, the world as we knew it ended. Decades of conflict lie aheadThe idea was that the West ‚Äì especially the part bordering the leading nuclear power ‚Äì would get a predictable security situation and clear rules of the game, together with a high degree of influence over Kiev. Western Europe would, in addition, preserve and strengthen its ties with Russia as its main resource base and also gain access to its extensive market. Ukraine would have the possibility of a soft integration into greater Europe while maintaining deep economic and cultural ties with Russia. Meanwhile Moscow, apart from its further gradual integration into the Western and primarily EU-led system, would maintain influence over Ukraine and enjoy the guarantee of friendly policies from Kiev towards both the Russian state and the multi-million ethnic Russian population in Ukraine.However, the entire history of post-Soviet Ukraine is a history of backward movement (which will be discussed below). This state of affairs has been irreversible since 2014, and the consistent ignoring of this fact and attempts to override the inevitable process ‚Äì via agreements with Kiev and the West ‚Äì have led us to the current military campaign.What exactly went wrong at the end of February last year is something we will not know for some time. However, if Moscow had the goal of solving the Ukrainian problem according to the 2008 Georgian scenario ‚Äì with little blood and within a few days ‚Äì this objective has obviously not been achieved.The fact is that the 30-year old anti-Russian outpost turned out to be very strong and ready to fight even at the cost of its own destruction ‚Äì again, contrary to common sense, as it is understood in Moscow.                   Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu     ¬© Sputnik  Sergei Savostyanov                                                        Hopefully, Russian illusions have been dispelled definitively and our political and military leadership is no longer relying on rational behavior from both the West and Kiev. However, so far, the course of the military offensive suggests rather the opposite.Right now, offensives are being carried out only in the Donbass, and not along the entire front, but in localised areas ‚Äì mainly by the forces of the Wagner private contractor group and the former local militias. There is a sense that during 2022 we didn‚Äôt really know what to do next, as if we were waiting for the enemy to get fed up before we did, and finally start to negotiate for real.Read moreFyodor Lukyanov: Why the Russia-Ukraine conflict is existential for both sidesOur second illusion concerned the combat capabilities of the army. The actions of the Russian Armed Forces are generally criticized in patriotic circles. But it should be understood that, for some time now, our army has not prepared for a large-scale land conflict with a front line of a couple of thousand kilometres, with the need to conduct combined armed operations on the level of World War Two, backed up by the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of men. This will not change overnight. And although the shortcomings identified in the actions of their Armed Forces, and their leadership, are recognized and somehow being addressed, we do not yet see a full-scale offensive with the decisive goal of defeating the Ukrainian Army. Perhaps we will this year. Perhaps the army is just now preparing rather than waiting.USAThe main illusion of the US in the post-Cold War era has been a belief in its complete control (or at least dominance) over what goes on in the world, and hence the notion that the interests of its counterparts is determined in Washington, and only in Washington. Put simply, things will be as I want them to be, and if not, I have sufficient means to cajole and punish those who disagree.In many ways, this inflexibility has led to the current crisis: it was impossible for US elites to reach an agreement with Russia ‚Äì while saving face and even benefitting economically and politically. Even though Moscow seemed prepared to compromise.Read moreFyodor Lukyanov: Why the US has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, from prolonging the Ukraine conflictThe situation is similar all over the world: everywhere the United States acts on the principle of ‚ÄúMight goes before right.‚ÄùIn the Middle East, such behaviour has already led to a sharp weakening of America‚Äôs position; the prospect of conflict with China has become almost irreversible, and Washington has laid time bombs under its relations with allies in Europe and Asia that are likely to go off in the coming years.Since the Second World War, the United States had been building a global system, a kind of new type of empire. Washington has consistently taken control of political and economic processes in the world without much resistance ‚Äì on the contrary, everyone has sought to integrate into this system, some gaining markets and access to cheap money, some obtaining a security umbrella and an opportunity not to spend money on their armies, some getting their hands on the latest technology.The US itself skimmed the cream off all this, and after several generations the American political class became convinced that such a system was not the result of painstaking work and consideration of partners‚Äô interests, but some kind of birthright, which at times became a burden. Hence, the more hysterical American foreign policy has become and the more it has attempted to force others to bend to its will. Consequently, it has undermined the global US-centric system.Washington still has a solid margin of safety, its base remains large, and alternative global institutions are only just beginning to take shape, so do not expect any noticeable change in US policy in the coming years, especially as internal divides are more likely to increase the foreign policy strain.                   US President Joe Biden     ¬© Mario Tama  Getty Images                                                        The second American (as well as Western European) illusion is that a military conflict, on the scale of what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine, can be won without direct involvement. Yes, the Ukrainian military is holding up quite well, but Russia has so far engaged only a small part of its military resources in the operation, and the degree of escalation on our part is now determined by political decisions, not military and mobilization capabilities. If we are willing and ready, we can increase the onslaught many times over, to which it will be extremely difficult for the West and the US to respond without directly engaging their forces (at least air defence and air force) in the conflict. However, President Biden has repeatedly stressed that he will not intervene as long as he‚Äôs in power.Read moreIvan Zuenko: China unveils a surprising new weapon in its information war against the WestWestern EuropeWestern Europe's main illusion is that its well-fed prosperity of recent decades is its own achievement and that it‚Äôs based on a set of abstract values. In reality, its wealth has rested on two pillars: the American military, political and economic roof and cheap resources, primarily Russian.A lack of concern about its own security and the impossibility of internal conflicts, on the one hand, contributed to an unprecedented economic boom, a true golden age, and on the other hand, led to the degeneration of Western European elites and the political class, who sincerely believed that this would always be the case and that all it took was cultivating values and striving to spread them to the rest of the ‚Äúbackward‚Äù world.This explains Western Europe‚Äôs stubbornness on the Ukrainian issue ‚Äì which borders on fanaticism. The EU, and its allies, accepts the most vicious anti-Russia sanctions with the greatest fervor, and with no regard for any damage.The bloc is deprived of a major market, of its most important resource base, and is being driven into near-colonial dependence on Washington, which, unlike Western Europe, has real military power and control over political and economic processes globally.

Because there is simply no one to make and implement them.Read moreFyodor Lukyanov: One year ago, Russia gave the West a last chance to prevent a full-blown conflict ‚Äì what went wrong?Plus, the long-standing problems of the EU, which it has brushed under the carpet in recent years ‚Äì such as the migration crisis and the constant concern about southern Europe‚Äôs economic stability ‚Äì remain.UkraineUkraine's main illusion is the belief that it is possible to build a mono-ethnic state hostile to Russia within its post-Soviet borders with a significant Russian population, and the belief that such a Ukraine will be tolerable to both the West and Russia itself.Ukraine is not Poland, and the attempt to tilt decisively to one bloc has led to a civil conflict, each side supported by the West and Russia respectively. After this conflict escalated into open conflict in 2014, Ukraine started to turn from an anti-Russian outpost into a weapon, a kind of kamikaze drone of the West against Moscow.Admittedly, this was partly successful: both the Ukrainian armed forces and the state as a whole withstood the February blow, recovered, and with Western support, inflicted a series of painful defeats on Russia by the autumn.The military successes, however, are not strategic, and the price is the death of the Ukrainian economy. According to various estimates, up to a third of the (pre-February 2022) population has fled the country. Meanwhile, production was cut in half even before the Russian strikes on energy facilities started in October, and by the New Year, according to official Kiev statements, it was down by 70 percent. This means unemployment, empty coffers, further impoverishment of the population and mass closures of businesses.                   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy     ¬© Metin Aktas  Anadolu Agency via Getty Images                                                        Yes, the West now serves as a powerful rear for Ukraine, at considerable cost, but it avoids getting directly involved in the fighting, shifting all the burden and hardship to Kiev. Whatever the end of the hot phase of the conflict, it appears that a devastated Ukraine will have to deal with the consequences on its own, and the further it goes on, the harder they will be.However, even if some among the Ukrainian elites can guess how they are being used, they cannot stop. The Western control is too tight, the ideological pumping is too great and things have gone too far.Read moreDmitry Trenin: Post-Soviet Russia is dead, but what will replace the West as the country's primary inspiration?Ukraine is now a zombie, a dead man walking, and it will continue moving as long as the West supports it. Nevertheless, even as it is, the Ukrainian military is capable of fighting for years, especially given the current sluggish course of the conflict.The West can withdraw support for Ukraine only in one scenario: if Kiev‚Äôs army is defeated and physically incapable of fighting, or if Ukraine physically shrinks enough to lose its strategic significance. Any ceasefire would only postpone the conflict for the future, and there should be no illusions about that.***The conflict has so far only escalated. For both Russia and the West it is existential, and neither side is inclined to compromise. All the more surprising is that the hostilities have so far been relatively localized, limited to one Ukrainian theater, and even there in a measured and positional manner. The parties seem to be focused on how to learn to live under the new conditions, which means that figuring out the new world order could happen relatively peacefully, without turning into major battle with the risk of a nuclear disaster.The initiative in this process will be taken by whoever accepts reality first, understands their place in it, and acts accordingly. This applies not only to the above-mentioned participants in the Ukrainian crisis, but also to neutral countries that have yet to give up their own illusions.ANALYSIS                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/569660-illusions-were-shattered-in-2022/,2023,Jan,10

However, when former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is offered as an option, she is preferred by 11% of voters, essentially dividing up the anti-Trump vote and enabling the ex-president to take a 38-35 lead over DeSantis. In a field expanded to include nine likely candidates, Trump leads the Florida governor by 37-36.Various polls have shown that Trump has lost much of his support among Republican voters since November‚Äôs congressional midterm elections, in which candidates he endorsed fared worse than expected. In contrast, DeSantis won re-election as governor by the state‚Äôs largest margin in 40 years, and he led a Republican ticket in which Florida candidates helped the GOP win back control of the US House of Representatives.
