But despite a temporary relaxation of restrictions on the war-torn and shaken country, problems still exist.Syrian provinces have still been left ill-prepared to deal with the scale of disaster that has befallen them and must now be given every support to reconstruct their country. According to authorities in Turkey and Syria, as many as 42,000 people have been killed by the devastating quakes, with at least 23 million people affected in total. Millions have been temporarily displaced, and many more still await news on their loved ones and whether or not they survived. The situation as it stands is an utter disaster, and the full impact is impossible to convey in mere words.In Türkiye’s case, the international community’s response was unanimous; aid was pledged, teams arrived to relieve the suffering and, whatever the political frictions between Istanbul and some Western nations, a sense of universal humanitarian comradery prevailed. The Biden administration in Washington reacted to the natural disaster by pledging “anything” that Ankara needed, while the European Union mobilized emergency response and offered its Copernicus satellite mapping service to help first responders in Türkiye.However, the situation has been very different for Syria with only a few select nations quick to come to its aid. The US government stated that it would not cooperate with Damascus to deal with the carnage inside Syrian territory. The Syrian government officially requested help from the EU, which some EU states instantly refused to provide. The United Kingdom quickly came to the aid of their NATO ally Türkiye, but refused help to the suffering Syrians, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky tweeted his condolences to Türkiye and its people in Turkish but failed to acknowledge Syria at all. Syrians were not in the spotlight to receive help from the West and are actively being ignored in spite of the gravity of the situation facing them.Read moreWestern sanctions will mean that more Syrians die after the earthquakesCompounding the difficulties is a plethora of sanctions against the Damascus government, which were applied by the EU, the UK and the US. The worst of these are perhaps the 2019 Caesar Act sanctions, which have severely crippled Syria’s post-war economy and robbed the nation of the ability to reconstruct.The US sanctions have indeed been amended for a short period, to allow relief aid to travel into Syria, but the problem with the sanctions is not just that they hindered aid from entering the country for days.The dire economic situation across Syria’s provinces, a problem preceding the current crisis, has undermined the medical sector’s capacity to deal with the sheer number of dead and injured following an earthquake of this magnitude. According to a number of UN experts, the sanctions imposed upon Syria were already causing a humanitarian crisis and should be lifted.“With more than half of the vital infrastructure either completely destroyed or severely damaged, the imposition of unilateral sanctions on key economic sectors, including oil, gas, electricity, trade, construction and engineering have quashed national income, and undermine efforts towards economic recovery and reconstruction,” Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on unilateral coercive measures and human rights, said last year.The UN has directly linked Syria’s current cholera epidemic to Western sanctions, which have prevented rehabilitation and development of water distribution networks at a time when 12 million Syrians grapple with food insecurity.According to on-the-ground accounts, during the first few days following the earthquake, there was not enough fuel to transport aid and rescue teams to affected areas quickly. In Syrian government-held areas, electricity only runs for a few hours per day under normal circumstances. Now, given the masses of displaced families, people are suffering in sub-zero temperatures at night.Exacerbating the issues is that while Syria is rich in natural gas and oil, the US military, along with its proxy forces in the northeast of the country, occupies a third of Syria’s territory, including its oil and gas fields. The most fertile agricultural lands have also been stolen from the Syrian people by US occupation, which was never granted congressional approval back in Washington. Piling onto that pressure, Israel also used the earthquake as an opportunity to claim that the Syrian government had requested aid from it, knowing this would reflect poorly on Damascus. The Syrian government denies this, and although Israel claims the aid would be directed to Syria, it was only sent to Türkiye.Read moreEconomic toll of Türkiye earthquakes estimatedThat the US State Department amended its sanctions is a tacit admission that they had prevented aid reaching Syria and that Washington is cognizant of this fact. Efforts to deny that sanctions impeded foreign nations from sending aid to those suffering, for example in The Washington Post are deceptive and done in poor faith.According to Aron Lund, a fellow with the New York-based think tank Century International, although the sanctions do not technically forbid aid, the reality on the ground is something completely different. Banks often block transfers that are supposed to pay suppliers or local aid workers for fear of breaking sanctions rules, Lund observed, as quoted by the Associated Press. Additionally, the sanctions actually target reconstruction inside Syria, which means that they will block rebuilding efforts, whether the destruction resulted from the 12-year-long war or from the earthquake.Out of Syria’s four primary border crossings, for years only the Bab al-Hawa crossing into the Idlib province was given a mandate by the UN for delivering aid to Syria. Idlib is controlled jointly between Turkish forces in the north and al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whereas the Syrian government does not have direct territorial access to the crossing and most countries refuse to use the Damascus International Airport to send aid.On top of this, the sole border crossing was severely damaged by the earthquake, depriving roughly 4 million Syrians of aid they depend on. Recently, Syrian President Bashar Assad offered support to civilians living inside the Idlib province, help that was rejected by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Syrian leader also permitted the opening of two additional crossings into Idlib, a move commended by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.The story that is unfolding in front of our eyes is one of bitter and selfish Western governments that put their obsession for regional hegemony above humanitarian issues. What happened to Syria and Türkiye should not be politicized and should not result in the deaths of those who are not in any way involved.The sanctions on Syria have killed innocent civilians, and the inaction of the West in aiding the Syrian people at this time is tantamount to abandoning those who could have been saved. If we now know that the sanctions block aid, why is it acceptable that the US only temporarily freeze them? They should not be in place at all, and neither should US forces occupy Syrian territory.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571653-syria-earthquake-us-led-economic/,2023,2,18
Why Tucker Carlson remains a giant that the establishment media can’t pull down — RT World News,"        Why Tucker Carlson remains a giant that the establishment media can’t pull down                        The Fox News star gives voice to the concerns of millions – the part of America that some would prefer not to hear            Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of 'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of 'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_BridgeTucker Carlson ©                Janos Kummer  Getty ImagesThe jungle of the US media kingdom appears to be divided between two powerful entities – the pro-establishment behemoth often referred to as the mainstream media, and Tucker Carlson. And against all odds, Carlson appears to be winning.It would be difficult to name a single person, aside from the rabble-rouser Donald J. Trump, who is more disgusting andor terrifying (depending on who you ask) for the establishment media than Fox News host Tucker Carlson. This one man is considered such a threat that the New York Times in May spent a boatload of ink to assassinate his character in a 20,000-word hit piece. Ironically, the article backfired as it laid bare the reasons Americans no longer trust the ‘legacy media’.Straight from the Grey Lady’s mouth: “‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ has presented a dominant narrative, recasting American racism to present white Americans as an oppressed caste. The ruling class uses fentanyl and other opioids to addict and kill legacy Americans, anti-white racism to cast them as bigots, feminism to degrade their self-esteem, immigration to erode their political power. Republican elites, however improbably, help to import the voters Democrats require at the ballot box. The United States, Mr. Carlson tells his viewers, is ‘ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule.’”Those sentiments, which the piece dismisses out of hand as some wild conspiracy theories, are shared by tens of millions of average Americans whose trust in journalists and politicians is now at an all-time low.Read moreMedia sees clue Tucker Carlson will run for US presidentTucker Carlson Tonight is the second-most-watched show on cable news. In September, the 8pm opinion news-talk show averaged 3.09 million viewers. The concerns he raises, night after night, resonate with a lot of Americans, and if you attack and dismiss his work, you are attacking the millions of Americans who can relate. It’s as if the establishment media wants those concerns to disappear – and the public is on to it.In a recent Gallup poll, it was found that just 34% of Americans trust the media to report the news “fully, accurately and fairly.” When you break down that shocking number, however, it becomes clearer why Tucker Carlson enrages the establishment so much: 70% of Democrats, 14% of Republicans, and 27% of independents say they trust the fourth estate. Naturally, those 70% of Democrats do not enjoy having their cherished belief systems exposed and ridiculed every evening by Mr. Carlson, nor do their loyal media outlets want to be exposed as a politically charged propaganda machine working on behalf of the Democratic Party.Consider, for example, the recent Black Lives Matter movement. Following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white cop, the entire country lost its collective mind in a bout of liberal insanity. In the coast-to-coast riots that broke out, not only were the American people expected to take a knee to this violent movement (which has since been exposed as a fraud that arguably never helped a single black person, apart from those who founded the organization to buy mansions), they were expected to endorse the defunding of the police. Carlson wasn’t buying any of it.“This may be a lot of things, this moment we’re living through, but it is definitely not about black lives,” Carlson said. “Remember that when they come for you, and at this rate, they will.”“Anyone who has ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling,” he continued. “It’s like being swarmed by hornets. You cannot think clearly. And the temptation is to panic. But you can’t panic. You’ve got to keep your head and tell the truth… If you show weakness of any kind, they will crush you.” He was speaking from experience, too – back in 2018, Antifa protesters besieged his home, threatening his family and vandalizing his property.Carlson’s lonely voice in the media wilderness sparked a massive backlash, with corporations, also heavily invested in the BLM movement to the tune of billions of dollars, pulling their advertising from his show, while establishment media shock troops quickly portrayed the Fox News host as a cold-blooded racist. Fortunately, Carlson has enough of a conservative base who agreed with his message and he survived the onslaught.More recently, Carlson has come under liberal fire for his ‘support of Vladimir Putin’, who is now embroiled in a bitter conflict against Ukraine. Here, the Fox News host has shown incredible courage, for no other person in the world of politics since Genghis Khan has been more vilified than the Russian president. Carlson asked a simple thing of his audience: To consider what Putin has done to them personally that makes him such an object of visceral hate.“It might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious, what is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs? Vladimir Putin didn’t do any of that.”Not only did Carlson ask his listeners to think twice about Vladimir Putin being propped up as the premier global villain, he suggested that the real enemy of the American people is none other than Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who has otherwise won fawning admiration from across the media spectrum.Read moreTucker Carlson slams Zelensky for ‘demanding’ moneyAt a time when the US-Mexico border is wide open, and inflation is spiraling out of control, only Carlson had the audacity to ask the simple question that millions of other Americans are also wondering: “Why are we still funding this?” Since the beginning of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, the US and its EU allies have forked over to Kiev around $126 billion worth of aid, a number almost equal to Ukraine’s entire 2020 GDP. And it seems that with every passing day, the Ukrainian leader demands more. And while it has been reported that much of the funds being sent to Ukraine never make it to the soldiers, it is the American people who must deal with the inflationary pressures from the limitless spending. How did Zelensky react to that news? Carlson quoted the Ukrainian leader as saying: “Inflation is nothing. Who is thinking about inflation? These things are secondary.” Secondary to what, you ask? Maybe like funneling the wealth out of the country to Cote d’Azur?“Ukraine’s leaders aren’t really hiding it anymore, they have total contempt for us,” Carlson said. “They just want our money. They don’t care about the United States even a little bit. This is not democracies uniting in solidarity. This is a scam.”Incidentally, is it any wonder, then, that Russian television has demonstrated an admiration for Carlson’s work, which is unique in that it is not tainted by raw anti-Russian propaganda? Just this week, the New York Times published an article alleging that Carlson and other US conservative voices had become “fixtures of internal news roundups, scripts and broadcasts” on various Russian news broadcasts. Apparently, this was supposed to demonstrate, once again, the nefarious relationship that exists between the Kremlin and the Republicans. In reality, it just shows how desperate the liberals have become to target Carlson and the Kremlin to help the Democrats advance on the political battlefield.The establishment media would undoubtedly boost their ratings out of the basement if they started talking like that too, but because they have never in the past 20 years reported on an American war they didn’t like, it certainly will never criticize a US proxy war where the only thing the country loses, at least so far, is billions of dollars in taxpayer money. After all, as many of these warmongers want to believe, Ukraine could be Russia’s ‘Afghanistan War’ that is said to have brought down the Soviet Union, or just maybe the equivalent of the humiliating defeat America suffered in the Vietnam War. Either way, it doesn’t matter because the defense industry stands to gain enormous profits, which is what this is all about.Whether they like it or not, Tucker Carlson remains a rare voice of candidness and honesty representing the genuine concerns of millions of Americans, which the establishment media would prefer to memory-hole.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/568524-tucker-carlson-media-hate/,2022,12,19

Beijing has also signed 5G arrangements with all of the GCC states, and has invested more than $123 billion in infrastructure projects in the region since the inauguration of its ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ in 2017, according to the Arab Center of Washington, DC, a Qatari think tank.Read moreBiden rejects Israel ‘apartheid’ claimsRepublicans in the US tout the Trump Administration’s negotiation of the Abraham Accords – which saw Israel normalize relations with some of its Arab neighbors – as proof that the US didn’t “walk away” from the region while Trump withdrew from the US’ Middle Eastern conflicts.However, China declared on Friday that the countries of the region were free to choose who they conducted trade and diplomacy with.“People in the Middle East are the masters of the Middle East. The Middle East is not the backyard of any other country and there is no such thing as a ‘vacuum’ to speak of,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.“People in the Middle East yearn for development and security more than anything else,” Wang continued. “For a long time, China has always supported people in the Middle East independently choosing the path of development and supporting Middle East countries in resolving regional security issues in solidarity and coordination.”                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/559067-biden-middle-east-vacuum/,2022,7,15
China is approaching a turning point in its history: Will Beijing join with Russia to confront the West or keep its powder dry? — RT World News,"        China is approaching a turning point in its history: Will Beijing join with Russia to confront the West or keep its powder dry?                        Experts discuss whether Xi will continue to lead his country and what it means for relations with Russia and the wider world            FILE PHOTO: 13th Communist Party congress inside the Great Hall of the People. ©                Michel Philippot  Sygma  Sygma via Getty ImagesThe 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the pinnacle event in the country’s political life and held only everyfive years, kicks off in Beijing on October 16. Experts will be tuning in to pick up any signals related not only to the political standing and prospects of China’s leader Xi Jinping, who is likely to run for a third term, but also to the way the country is planning to build its relations with the US and Russia in the future.A new Mao – a new revolution?Western speculation believes that the event could signify a triumph for Xi as he will most likely remain at the helm of the party for a third term. Should that happen, it would go against the tradition which has formed in Chinese politics over the last 30 years. Up to now, the reins of power in the country were handed over to a new generation of leaders at the end of the second term.Thus, such a move would herald a new era in the history of modern China.Starting from 2018, it has become increasingly clear that Xi is going to defy this tradition. That year, amendments were made to the Chinese Constitution lifting the two-term limit on the presidency.

Most of the world’s countries don’t really care who is in charge in China. What is important is the kind of policies China is going to pursue in the future, and how stable the country is going to be,” Lomanov explained.Read more60 years since the Cuban Missile Crisis: How cool heads prevented a Soviet-US naval encounter sparking a nuclear warAlso, the congress is expected to review the party’s work and achievements over the last five years as well as to announce the new composition of its ‘board of directors’ – the Political Bureau (Politburo) Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee, composed of the party’s top officials who make all the important decisions in the country. Today, it’s made up of seven members (historically, this number has ranged from five to nine).It is believed that at least three of the party members currently serving on the Standing Committee will resign for various reasons, including China’s second most important man – Premier of the State Council Li Keqiang. He is required by law to step down as premier in 2023, since the term limit was only removed for the president.2,300 CPC delegated are expected to take part in the upcoming congress, with the total number of party members exceeding 90 million people.The Congress will focus on China’s domestic agendaExperts appear to be united in their forecasts that if there are any unexpected moves at all – such as restoring the Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, a post abolished in 1982 – they will most likely only concern the party’s inner workings. Foreign policy will not be high on the agenda, in all likelihood.The historical and political self-sufficiency characteristic of China throughout its history is still there in the 21st century. The Chinese have never really cared about much happening outside of their country, which they traditionally call ‘The Middle Kingdom’ (中国).While espousing a supposedly international ideology, the CPC does not really deviate from this tradition. In his speech at the 2017 Party Congress, Xi Jinping mentioned the building of a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind – his key foreign-policy concept – only in chapter 12 out of 13.

Just compare any Chinese report to Brezhnev’s speech at the 26th Congress in 1981, where the international agenda was mentioned as early as the first chapter. The Chinese congresses are about China first and foremost. About the role of the CPC in public life, the economy, and the country’s social policies. It would be wrong to say that foreign policy is absent, but it usually appears closer to the end of reports. It’s not a priority at all at the CPC congresses, historically,” he explained.Read moreHow the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has managed to unite Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian elites in collective angerThe Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Higher School of Economics, Vasily Kashin, told RT that China is still in the phase of active establishment and promotion of its ideology in foreign affairs.The Community with a Shared Future for Mankind (人类命运共同体) has arguably become the main foreign political concept of Xi's rule, presenting the Chinese vision of a fair world order to the international public. The phrase first appeared in a report of the ex-General Secretary of the CPC Hu Jintao at the 17th Congress in 2007, referring to a common future of continental China and Taiwan. Five years later, Hu expanded the meaning by adding ‘for mankind.’ The concept was later promoted by his successor Xi Jinping.The plans calls for a new mindset that would lead to a more fair reformation of the global leadership. This is, in essence, a positive agenda, but it is criticized by the West and India, who seek to bar the phrase itself from being mentioned in any UN resolutions. Beijing’s rivals see it as promotion of the PRC’s propaganda aimed at building a new world order.The Covid-19 pandemic presented an opportunity for China to bring the concept to life. The virus was transnational, and providing aid to other nations proved beneficial to the donors themselves, while the finger-pointing by former President Donald Trump and attempts by the US to pull through on its own under his administration went against shared global interests. At the same time, China’s own ‘zero tolerance’ policy has also been a rather peculiar strategy, and the PRC refrains from actively promoting it abroad.

China isn’t going to abandon the concept soon and it will remain a priority for as long as Xi Jinping remains in power – meaning for the rest of 2020s,"" he said.The narrative of a ‘shared future’ is relevant for China in the context of the Taiwan issue as well, which itself balances on a thin line between domestic and foreign affairs. The island is actively forming its new identity almost completely unrelated to continental China. It’s one of the Party’s priorities to offer a carrot in addition to a stick to the islanders to prevent their complete secession. Lomanov argues the West is trying to play the Taiwan card to its own benefit, so the potential is growing of this issue becoming one the most dangerous conflicts in the world.Read moreDmitry Trenin: Putin has proclaimed a new national idea for Russia as it abandons the dream of a Greater EuropePutin is my friend, but…On September 30, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on accession of four former Ukrainianregions to Russia. Prior to the signing, he delivered a lengthy speech at Georgievsky Hall in the Kremlin Palace, extensively criticizing the world order formed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Russia has essentially signaled that it is ready to pick up the fallen banner of the Soviet Union and spearhead the anticolonial struggle on the international stage in the 21st century.“TheWest is ready tocross every line topreserve theneo-colonial system which allows it tolive off theworld, toplunder it thanks tothedomination ofthedollar andtechnology, tocollect anactual tribute from humanity, toextract its primary source ofunearned prosperity, therent paid tothehegemon.

He spoke of China's defeats at the hands of Britain and France in the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century. Afterwards, China was forced to open its ports for Europeans to engage in the opium trade, a drug that caused great misery for its people. According to Chinese historians, those events ushered in a ""century of humiliation,"" as China had to sign a series of unequal treaties which would only be terminated in 1949 with the creation of the People's Republic.Read moreBe careful what you post: How Facebook and the US government have united against Americans with the 'wrong' viewsRealistically, however, how can this uncharacteristic reference to Asian history help Putin persuade China to challenge the West in earnest and threaten the existing world order?Experts doubt that Beijing will abandon its policy of prudence and caution, and there are a number of reasons for that.""Much of what Vladimir Putin said in his speech at the accession ceremony is in line with China's own attitudes. But when China talks about similar matters, the wording is often much broader and generally ambiguous. Naturally, Beijing is aware that its confrontation with the West is getting more intense. However, at the level of rhetoric, China tries to avoid being as explicit when expressing its position. Moscow and Beijing have similar viewpoints in that both believe the policies of the West are flawed, as they create artificial barriers to global trade, financial and economic ties and investment opportunities,"" Lomanov said.“China also criticizes the West for building 'small fortresses with high walls', referring to blocs like NATO and AUKUS, exclusive alliances designed to unite Western countries and those loyal to them, effectively cutting off everyone else. ""China has always stressed the need to reform the existing system of global governance, as it is deeply unfair to developing countries. Despite all its leaps in economic development, China considers itself both a socialist country and the world's leading developing nation. Therefore, at a practical level, the positions of Russia and China are indeed very close,""the expert from IMEMO RAS believes.

But even if internally the Chinese can relate to his words, they will not explicitly voice their support for them. The fact is that China simply does not have an overall policy towards the West - it makes a sharp distinction between Europe and the United States. And what worries Beijing the most about Russia's special military operation in Ukraine is the major increase of US influence in Europe. In other matters, the Chinese are largely in agreement with the Russians, but they do try to avoid overly confrontational rhetoric,"" said the expert.Moreover, in his statements, the Chinese president will most likely keep the number of references to other countries to a minimum.""There will be no official words of support for Russia in the documents passed by the CPC national congress; at most, it may be mentioned as one of China's major partners. As for its statements about the US, in theory, there could be some openly critical assessments. They could say, for example, that the actions of the US serve only to inflame further tensions,""Kashin speculated.ByMaxim Hvatkov,a Russian journalist focusing on international security, China's politics and soft-power tools.Feature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/564589-china-is-approaching-turning-point/,2022,10,15

Despite insisting that the UK should oppose “authoritarian regimes” around the world, Truss said that Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing totalitarian states are “partners.”In a speech to Commonwealth leaders last week, Truss argued that Britain and its former imperial territories should act as a “bulwark” against Russia and China, and a “robust counterweight to authoritarian regimes” in general. Regarding Russia, Truss has taken an uncompromising position, telling reporters at the NATO summit on Wednesday that Britain and her allies must “defeat Russia first, and negotiate later.”However, her attitude to the Middle Eastern regimes that supply Britain’s oil is more flexible.Speaking at a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, Truss refused to describe the Gulf states as “authoritarian,” saying instead that they are “partners of the United Kingdom.”Liz Truss refuses to call out Saudi Arabia as an authoritarian state.Chris Bryant - Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for Jamal Khashoggi's murder..

The West still misunderstands the man who shaped China’s rise — RT World News,"        The West still misunderstands the man who shaped China’s rise                        25 years after the death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, his legacy remains complicated            Tom Fowdy is a British writer and analyst of politics and international relations with a primary focus on East Asia.Tom Fowdy is a British writer and analyst of politics and international relations with a primary focus on East Asia.Deng Xiaoping © Wally McNamee  CORBISCorbis via Getty Images Saturday, February 19, marks 25 years since the death of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who succeeded Mao Zedong and oversaw a fundamental transition in China’s place in the world with a policy dubbed ‘reform and opening up’.For those in the West, Deng’s reign, which began in 1978, heralded a hope that China was going to become more open and more liberal, and that its transition towards market-based economic reforms would spell an end to communism in the country, with his tenure coinciding with the conclusion of the Cold War.But two-and-a-half decades after his death in 1997, many might find themselves disappointed that this has not proved to be the case. China’s political system neither collapsed nor opened up significantly, and under the rule of Xi Jinping, the country has seemingly moved away from the path which Deng set it on, instead ushering in a fresh era of geopolitical tensions with the West in what has been widely called a new Cold War. What changed? And just how relevant is the legacy of Deng in today’s China?As much as the West may have romanticised Deng, he was far from the ‘revisionist’ to communism in China he was hoped to be. Deng, after all, had come from the stock of Chinese revolutionaries who had been with the Communist Party from the very beginning, and adopted Marxist ideas after five years of studying in France. He fought in the Sino-Japanese War, as well as the Chinese Civil War. However, alongside his ideological worldview, he was very firmly a pragmatist, believing that things ought to be done by the means, which had been proven to work best, as opposed to theory or principle.This outlook left Deng on the wrong side of Mao Zedong on many occasions. In seeking to consolidate his personal power, Mao demonstrated the sheer force of his ideology in several disastrous campaigns, including the Great Leap Forwards and the Cultural Revolution. Although Deng would be purged in the turmoil of it all, it was following Mao’s death that he emerged as the most suitable person to reshape China from these disasters and to move the country forwards.Famously arguing that “practice is the sole criterion of truth” and reinterpreting Mao’s theory, Deng oversaw the reform and opening up of China by establishing a ‘socialist market economy’ and laying the foundations for the country to transform itself into an international economic powerhouse, while moderately liberalising society.Read moreLeader for life: What Xi Jinping’s elevation means for China and the worldAs part of this, there was a policy of rapprochement with the West and the United States, as famously depicted by a photo of him donning a cowboy hat while visiting America. He also oversaw negotiations for the return of Hong Kong with Margaret Thatcher’s UK government, securingthe Sino-British declaration in 1984.This era of optimism in the 1980s has led some in the West to look back wistfully at Deng, assuming that China was then on what they would consider ‘the right track’. But the world is now a very different place. And the reality is that the China of the 1980s was never truly liberal (the end to the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which was overseen by Deng, is a stark reminder of that). In addition, the country was weaker and poorer then, and critically, the West was stronger.With the Cold War coming to an end, the following decade would set the ‘end of history’ narrative that communism had critically failed and that Western liberalism was victorious and necessary for human progress. It was assumed that China was on a path of transition, and engagement with Western capitalism was part of that.But this misunderstands the role of Deng. His policies were not about placing China on an inevitable trajectory to Western liberalism, so much as utilising the best means to make the country succeed within that context. Thus, as the context changed, so would the methods needed. Deng’s successors, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping, have not abandoned the socialist market approach he embraced – far from it, in fact. They have adapted China’s perceived needs to its environment, but what was not understood was that they could also go in a more authoritarian direction in doing so.As China became wealthier, it did not in turn become any freer. Rather, the rapid development of new factors such as the internet would comprehensively change how Beijing perceived its own regime security, heralding the Great Firewall of China for example. And as China grew without crystallising into the more liberal state the West had once hoped for, so did the geopolitical dynamic and its impact on China’s foreign relations.While the West saw Deng as a strategic partner, exploiting the Sino-Soviet split and believing communism’s days in China were coming to an end, now Xi presides over a China which is the world’s second largest economy and is seen as a geopolitical rival, amid widespread fears that Beijing could displace the system of Western hegemony that has dominated world affairs for 400 years. Few believed this could ever happen. America has changed from embracing business with China, to seemingly loathing it and fearing it.While Deng pledged to the United Kingdom that Hong Kong would remain an autonomous entity in the Sino-British declaration, the territory’s unwillingness to come to terms with its new identity and the riots that followed resulted in claims Beijing violated the 1984 treaty, showing how old issues have created new tensions. China finds itself once again becoming insecure and suspicious of the intentions of the West, which is considered to be seeking to contain and dominate it to try and stop its inevitable rise, hailed by Xi Jinping as the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”Read moreThe diplomatic row that shows China’s true global strengthDeng’s efforts are viewed as the beginning of a journey, rather than the destination, and Xi believes his rule over China will mark the end of that journey. While Deng’s China, given its more vulnerable geopolitical position, had a foreign policy strategy of ‘Taoguangyanghui’ (to hide low), Xi has sought to display more confidence in using the country’s strength and power, be it over issues such as the South China Sea, Taiwan or even to take on nations seeking to oppose China such as Lithuania. As tensions have flared, many aspects of the Deng era are simply no longer applicable to today’s world.What we see 25 years on from Deng’s death is not a denunciation of his legacy in Beijing, but an adaptation of it that few anticipated, one that comes with a completely changing power dynamic. Yet what is indisputable is that Deng laid the political, economic, and strategic foundations for China to rise again as a powerful country. He inherited a nation that was in chaos due to the mistakes of Mao Zedong, but made it work with his pragmatic philosophy.It was the route that China has taken since that the West perhaps didn’t see coming. They praised Deng as a bold and liberal reformer, but the reality is he was more of a skilled tactician and bureaucrat.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/549867-deng-xiaoping-china-rise/,2022,2,19

With Johnson fighting for his political life in London, he told Sturgeon that rising costs, Covid-19, and Britain’s support for Ukraine are more important issues.Sturgeon announced last month that a second independence referendum would be held in October 2023, nine years after Scottish voters chose for their country to remain a member of the United Kingdom.However, without a temporary transfer of power from London to Holyrood, the referendum would be a symbolic one, and Johnson refused to give Sturgeon this critical transfer.“I cannot agree that now is the time to return to a question, which was clearly answered by the people of Scotland in 2014,” Johnson wrote. Instead, the PM wrote that Scotland and the rest of the UK should focus on their “shared priorities,” which he listed as responding to inflation, recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, and playing “our leading part in the international response to Russian aggression in Ukraine.”Just received this from Johnson (one of his last acts as PM?).

In a post on Twitter, she described Johnson’s letter as possibly “one of his last acts as PM,” a reference to the calls for resignation leveled at Johnson after dozens of his ministers resigned on Tuesday and Wednesday, citing multiple scandals on Downing Street.“To be clear, Scotland will have the opportunity to choose independence – I hope in a referendum on 19 October 2023 but, if not, through a general election,” she tweeted. “Scottish democracy will not be a prisoner of this or any PM.”Read moreUK conservatives plot move against PM – BloombergWithout Johnson granting a transfer of power, Sturgeon’s only hope for independence would rest on Parliament in Westminster passing a bill to recognize a successful vote.

He also brought up the recent killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, slain during an Israeli raid in the West bank.: Biden claims he pressed Saudi leader on journalist’s murder“In the same year, similar regrettable incidents took place and other journalists were killed in other parts around the world,” the crown prince said. “The United States also made a number of mistakes like the incident of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and others.”All countries around the world, including the US and Saudi Arabia, share values that they agree on and have others that they disagree on, the crown prince suggested. Imposing said values on others, however, is not exactly a good idea, he went on, pointing to Washington’s failures in the Middle East.“However, trying to impose those values by force could have the opposite effect, as happened in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the US was unsuccessful,” he said.: Saudi Arabia outlines what it will do for oil outputThe 2018 murder in Turkey, which the CIA claimed was ordered by Mohammed bin Salman himself, left a major dent in the US-Saudi relations.

The implications of the constant stream of disinformation is the justification of sanctions that kill Iranians.Following the death in Iranian custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, back in mid-September, civil unrest in Iran spread far and wide, with protests sparked over foreign media reports that had indicated that the young woman was beaten to death by Iran’s morality police. Later, CCTV footage was released, which contradicted some reports on how the young woman had died, followed by a coroner report which indicated her death came due to cerebral hypoxia as a result of underlying issues. Despite this, the demonstrations that started on September 16 continued.What started initially as a number of demonstrations, primarily in Kurdish-predominant areas of Iran, turned into a nationwide dis-united movement that took the form of violent riots, online social media campaigns, symbolic hijab burning protests and even deadly terrorist attacks against sites of worship. As Iran accusedthe United States and Israel of attempting to spark a Syria-style civil war, US President Joe Biden vowed to “free Iran”during a speech in California. Amongst the chaos and the media reporting that aimed to portray the Iranian government as a distinct kind of evil, the Biden administration began to tighten its ‘maximum pressure’ sanctions campaign. The current US sanctions campaign, first enacted under the former Trump administration, has been condemnedby the International Court of Justice due to its impact on humanitarian goods, such as medicine, entering Iran.Read moreIran abolishes morality policeOutright lies, anonymous sources and distortionsPerhaps the most prominent piece of disinformation that has been disseminated about Iran during the past few months was the assertion, by Newsweek, that 15,000 Iranian demonstrators were sentenced to death. According to the initial claims, the Iranian parliament had supposedly voted to approve this move, implying that the country's judiciary took no part in such a massive decision. The story was spread by leading online personas and even Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, who later deleted his post on Twitter about the matter.However, since then the outlandish claims have not stopped coming. Prior to the Iranian national team's game against the US in the FIFA World Cup, CNN released a reportthat no other major news outlet, save for a few tabloid news sites in the UK, touched. CNN quoted an unnamed “security source” that according to the report had managed to find out that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had infiltrated Qatar in order to threaten the Iranian team’s players.The CNN story states that the source somehow found out that the players were offered luxury gifts, such as vehicles, prior to the beginning of the World Cup, which would imply that the source had intel on the Iranian team when they were in Tehran before the tournament. The report goes on to say that IRGC officials threatened the Iranian players’ families with torture in the event that they may protest their government during the World Cup. CNN’s source also claims that the coach of the Iranian team, a Portuguese national, was also interviewed by the IRGC, although they weren’t able to hear what was discussed like they did with the players.The same article makes the additional claim that the Iranian government was flying out pro-government supporters to watch the team play, in essence creating artificial fans. None of the claims have been corroborated, and it didn’t gain purchase with major news outlets, which is strange considering the severity of the allegations being made that the IRGC, an official branch of Iran’s armed forces, had violated Qatar’s sovereignty in order to threaten their own football team. The difference between the CNN and Newsweek piece is that with the “security source”, there is no way to determine with certainty whether the whole thing is made up or not.In the advent of news that Iran had abolished its morality police unit, responsible for the arrest of Mahsa Amini, another false story emerged from a number of little-known crypto-currency outlets online, claiming that Iran was set to freeze the bank account of women who weren’t wearing the appropriate Islamic covering. The origins of the story came from an interview that was conducted with an ultra-conservative member of Iran’s parliament, Hossein Jalali, who allegedly proposed a three-warning system via SMS, with the end penalty being the freezing of bank accounts. This has never come close to being implemented or even been discussed in parliament. Despite this, tweets claiming that Iran was implementing this strategy went viral.Read moreIran announces retaliation against the EUPosts on social media from influencers have claimed that the Iranian security forces “are raping children”, and that young women are being murderedfor showing their hair in a “horrific” and “medieval” crackdown. These reactions naturally come as a result of the factual inaccuracies of the reporting about Iran and we continue to see more and more as the weeks go on.The most recent misrepresentation of the facts has come in the coverage and reaction to a number of executions in Iran. Earlier this month, the second death sentence connected to the recent civil unrest was carried out. This led to headlines from the likes of the Associated Press (AP), that read 'Iran execution: Man publicly hanged from crane amid protests', which is how we saw the sentencing of Majidreza Rahnavard to death, by the Iranian judiciary, framed throughout Western media. The AP piece opens with the following paragraph:“Iran executed a second prisoner on Monday convicted over crimes committed during the nationwide protests challenging the country’s theocracy, publicly hanging him from a construction crane as a gruesome warning to others.”Whilst the AP article did explain, further down in the piece, that the young Iranian man had stabbed to death two Iranian security officials, injuring 4 others, what is written works to present Tehran as a monstrous regime that is unjustly killing Iranian protesters as a warning to others. The reality is, Iran does have a death sentence and does carry it out, but since some States in the US do the same, the story has to be twisted so that Iran is singled out as a special kind of evil. Iran’s death sentence is handed out through a judicial process, during which Majidreza Rahnavard admitted to killing two security officials. The incident was even filmed. No country on earth would allow such a crime to go unpunished.In total, roughly 400 Iranianshave allegedly been sentenced to prison terms for their involvement in various criminal activities during the latest round of civil unrest. Two Iranians have been executed, after admitting to carrying out attacks against the nation's security forces.Whilst there are others who may receive the death penalty, the Western media took it upon themselves to whip up a frenzy about an execution that was not even ruled. Earlier this month, several outlets ran headlines with allegations that an Iranian football player from Isfahan was next in line for execution. Reports claimed that a small-time football player, Nasr Azadani, had been sentenced to death and despite the Iranian judiciary denying this, the claims took hold on social media. 26-year-old Nasr Azadani was arrested in connection with the murder of several members of Iran’s security services. It has been reported that an indictment carrying the charge of “accessory to moharebeh” had been communicated with Azadani. The charge of “moharebeh” (“war against God” in Islamic law) can carry with it a death sentence, however, it is not clear whether being an accessory would be ruled this way.Read moreTop commander promises ‘graveyard’ for enemies of IranThe problem here is that Western media outlets jump on unsubstantiated claims, and repeat half truths, in an attempt to extract a predetermined anti-Iran narrative. From trusted outlets like the AP, to CNN, all the way to the tabloids, there is little care for fact checking and journalistic integrity. The goal is to delegitimize the Iranian government, to encourage outrage. Factual information is only important for nit-picking in a way that supports this biased narrative. At the same time, it is somewhat ironic that none of these media outlets, or Western politicians that repeat their claims and feign concern over Iranian prisoners, care one bit for journalist Julian Assange, who the US is attempting to extradite from the United Kingdom.The outcomes of this kind of reporting are the encouragement of prejudiced hate against Iranian culture, the justification of sanctions that kill Iranians and the peddling of new-Orientalism talking points, all whilst claiming to be in support of human rights and feminism. There are various ways to make good faith criticisms of the Iranian government, but this is not what we are seeing, this is the Western media machine piling in on a regime change agenda, and everything they say needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/568999-mahsa-amini-iran-protest/,2023,1,5
Omicron mutant strain first detected in India sets off alarms — RT World News,"        Omicron mutant strain first detected in India sets off alarms                        The highly mutated BA.2.75 strain is now popping up in numerous countries, WHO warns            FILE PHOTO: Family members of a coronavirus patient transport them by themselves to another hospital in Patna, India. © Parwaz Khan  Hindustan Times via Getty Images As India faces a rise in Covid-19 cases, a new subvariant of Omicron dubbed BA.2.75 has been identified all over the country, as well as in about ten other nations, the Word Health Organization (WHO) warned last week. The presence of the latest mutant strain has been reported in ten Indian states in total, ranging from Tamil Nadu in the south to Uttar Pradesh in the north, the global health body’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan confirmed, in an interview with the Times of India on Sunday.Outside of the country, the subvariant has been spotted in approximately ten nations, she tweeted. As reported by the Associated Press, these include Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US, where a third case was identified last week.BA.2.75 could potentially outcompete other highly transmissible coronavirus subvariants – including both BA.4 and BA.5 which by late June have become dominant in the US, the UK, Germany, and France, as confirmed by the health authorities of these countries.Read moreNorth Korea declares health emergencyAt a meeting to discuss the new strain last Friday, scientists at India’s SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said early data suggested BA.2.75 could be less severe, with most people who become infected with it either being asymptomatic or having mild symptoms. However, further studies will be needed to confirm if the strain is indeed less severe – and if it is leading the current Covid surge India is facing, experts say.All countries should be keeping a close watch out for BA.2.75 as there still aren’t enough samples globally to analyse its severity, Swaminathan said in her interview. The subvariant’s high transmissibility potential comes from the mutations of its spike protein, the official added. She went on to elaborate, “This being the key part of the virus that attaches itself to the human receptor, we need to keep a watch on its behavior. But it’s still too early to tell if the subvariant has properties of additional immune invasion or is clinically more severe.”According to Dr Ulrich Elling, group leader at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology at Austria’s Academy of Sciences, BA.2.75’s spike protein has eight new mutations compared to the older BA.2 subvariant (versus three new mutations for BA.5). While it is indeed too early to tell if BA.2.75 will indeed supersede other subvariants, the fact that it is growing very fast in India –despite lower levels of viral surveillance– suggests that it may yet prove dangerous, the researcher said on Twitter.

BBC staff told there are more than 150 genders – Telegraph — RT World News,"        BBC staff told there are more than 150 genders – Telegraph                        Whistleblowers allege a woke takeover of Britain’s national broadcaster            FILE PHOTO: Members of the LGBT community take part in the annual Pride Parade in London, Britain, July 7, 2018 © AFP  Tolga Akmen Britain's state-broadcaster BBC hired “trans and nonbinary inclusion” consultants to tell its staff that there are more than 150 genders and instruct them to police each other’s use of gender pronouns, the Telegraph reported on Saturday.According to the report, the BBC emailed its radio producers and program editors urging them to attend several training sessions last year organized by Global Butterflies, a group that describes itself on LinkedIn as offering “Trans & Non-binary Corporate Inclusion Training and Consultation.”During the sessions, staff were reportedly told that “people can self-identify themselves in over 150 ways, and increasing!” They were shown examples of newly-invented gender pronouns such as “xe, xem, xyrs,” and told to include their own pronouns in their email signatures to be more “inclusive and welcoming” and to further their “trans brand.”Those opting to go by traditional “heshe” pronouns were told that these descriptors “can create discomfort, stress and anxiety” for trans and non-binary colleagues, and that “using correct pronouns and names reduces depression and suicide risks.”Read moreGermany lets trans footballers choose men’s or women’s teams“If you overhear a colleague using the incorrect pronouns for someone, take them aside and remind them of the correct pronouns,” attendees were told.The training sessions were held less than a year after Tim Davie took over as the BBC’s director. Upon taking the reins, Davie instructed employees at the taxpayer-funded broadcaster to stop “virtue-signaling” online and urged journalists to remain impartial and even to watch their body language and tone of voice when on camera, to avoid revealing “a personal opinion or prejudice.”Amid this apparent crackdown on woke ideology, employees within the BBC’s ‘Pride Network’ claimed that they were told by higher-ups to “get used to” covering stories and hearing opinions that hurt their feelings, such as a story on lesbians being coerced into sex with transgender women, who are biologically male.However, the Telegraph’s source, who recently quit the corporation, said that “the BBC simply doesn’t understand what’s going on with gender identity ideology,” and has “been pandering to a social contagion amongst young people rather than being the adult in the room.”The whistleblower said that there is a “tight-knit cabal at the top of BBC News who give tacit approval to gender ideology.” This group allegedly shoots down stories critical of transgender ideology, while stories that “affirm gender ideology…go straight to output.”:    UK Culture Secretary reveals plans for trans bansThe BBC did not tell the Telegraph how much taxpayer money it paid Global Butterflies for the training sessions but said that it has since cut ties with the group. The training sessions were described by a BBC spokesman as “voluntary” and allegedly had “no link to, or influence on, any editorial decision making.”Global Butterflies did not respond to the Telegraph, and its website was down for maintenance when checked by RT. An archived version of the site from last year lists the London Stock Exchange, Shell, the National Health Service, the British Transport Police and the United Kingdom Strategic Command as some of its clients.

In announcing the latest waiver, however, the Treasury cited a 2019 law which allows exemptions for penalties on Russia under certain circumstances.Despite the push to penalize Russia, a number of European countries remain dependent on Moscow's energy supplies, creating some reluctance to support calls for outright embargoes on gas, oil and coal.Gazprombank is among the largest banks in Russia by assets held, largely working in the corporate and investment sectors. The United States and a series of allies slapped penalties on the bank in February, imposing debt and equity restrictions afterRussia attacked Ukraine, part of a coordinated effort to “isolate” and “cripple” Russia’s economy.

New Zealand PM’s resignation might leave China nervous — RT World News,"        New Zealand PM’s resignation might leave China nervous                        Jacinda Ardern’s exit could create openings for both Washington and Beijing to boost their influence on Wellington            ByTimur Fomenko, political analystNew Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern listens to speech during the ASEAN - East Asia Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2022. ©                AP PhotoVincent ThianNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced she will resign in February, saying she doesn’t have “enough in the tank” to keep going, ending a six-year tenure in Wellington which, for the most part, was praised around the world. Some called her “one of the greatest prime ministers in New Zealand’s history.”But as she leaves office, there will be big geopolitical ramifications as well. China, for one, will be watching events in New Zealand carefully, and will be nervous about whether her successor, whoever that might be, will continue to follow what was Ardern’s “China-friendly” foreign policy, a notion which often put her at odds with her Five Eyes allies.When it comes to the Five Eyes, a US-dominated espionage alliance founded during World War II, New Zealand has been the odd duck, or odd kiwi if you like, when it comes to China. While the United Kingdom, Canada and, for a while, Australia have become hyper aggressive against Beijing and uncritically signed up to the US-led containment agenda, New Zealand under Ardern was different, and opted in many respects to do its own thing.There are many reasons why. First, New Zealand, in terms of population, is much smaller than the rest of the Five Eyes. Although its territory is larger than that of Britain, the country is populated by just five million people (fewer than London), which makes it much more vulnerable in geopolitical confrontation.: New Zealand PM makes shock announcementSecond, New Zealand is much less zealous, militaristic, and aggressive than the other Five-Eyes countries, due to the differing historical circumstances in which it emerged as a “compromise” between the British and the native Maori population. The country’s identity is less “Anglicized” and more “Polynesian.” While indigenous peoples in the other Anglosphere countries were pretty much decimated, Maori remain a cultural and political force, which changes New Zealand’s outlook.Third, New Zealand’s economy is highly reliant on agriculture-related exports, for which China is the largest market, leaving it with a gigantic surplus. Ardern subsequently worked hard to enhance New Zealand’s trade relationship with Beijing, having upgraded the bilateral trade agreement with China in 2022.But the question now is, with Ardern having been a highly progressive and left-leaning prime minister, will things change? Might New Zealand experience a foreign policy shift? As of now, it is impossible to say, although it seems logical that someone with her faction of the party, or perhaps who already served in government with her, may take power. Nonetheless, one can absolutely guarantee that on the other hand, there will be an effort from the United States to attempt to “reset” New Zealand’s foreign policy course, with America ultimately seeing it as a critical Indo-Pacific ally due to its geographical position.However, short of New Zealand getting a Scott Morrison-like right-wing populist (which obviously will not be found in the country’s Labour Party), the chances of a full U-turn and a collision course with Beijing remains unlikely. That’s because these geographic and economic realities matter. Likewise, the mood in Canberra is also working in New Zealand’s favor. With the Labour Party now also in power in Australia, and Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong leading a more pragmatic policy towards China, repairing the damage caused by Scott Morrison’s pro-American fanaticism, New Zealand’s overall foreign policy environment will be a lot more comfortable.: What US Republicans could do with their new anti-China committeeThat doesn’t mean, of course, that China will not try to put its “stamp of authority” on the country again either. In the past few months, it was reported in the press that Ardern had been invited to Beijing. However, her pending resignation now makes that visit seem improbable. China is likely to respond to this scenario by quickly extending an invitation to her successor to come and meet with Xi Jinping. Fearing pressure from the United States and any potential change of course, Beijing will seek stability and continuity as quickly as possible. This is because China fears the unity of the Five Eyes against it, and has had more success in dealing with New Zealand than any other member.Either way, it is an understatement that Ardern will be missed, for various reasons, the world over. She will be remembered as a compassionate, positive, caring, and dedicated individual. Yet for all the West’s love for her, she positioned herself as an ambiguous and cautious leader in respect of the biggest geopolitical struggle today. Ardern was realistic, moderate and sensible when it came to China and rejected the Cold War approach seen in other Five Eyes capitals. Beijing will want to preserve her legacy as much as possible.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/570139-jacinda-ardern-resignation-china/,2023,1,19
Support for anti-Russia sanctions drops – poll — RT World News,"        Support for anti-Russia sanctions drops – poll                        The soaring cost of living in the UK appears to have overshadowed concern for Ukraine            © Getty Images  Adam Gault The number of Britons advocating harsh economic sanctions against Russia in response to its military offensive in Ukraine has dropped over the past month, according to a newopinion poll.Conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, and commissioned by The Sunday Telegraph, the survey indicates that only 36% of the respondents, polled this week, are prepared to accept higher fuel prices in order to hurt Russia more – 14 percentage points down from 50% in March.A third of the Britons surveyed replied in the negative when asked if they were willing to pay more for food to help Ukraine withstand the Russian offensive. Around the same, however, said it’s a sacrifice worth making.54% of the respondents reported a worsening of their financial situation in the last year, up from 42% two months ago, and 62% said they expect the future to be even bleaker.More than two-thirds of Britons said they have not received a pay raise despite the growing cost of living, and most of those who did receive a raise said it’s not enough to offset inflation.Based on these latest findings, The Telegraph surmised that personal financial woes may now have overshadowed concern over Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine in the eyes of the general public in the UK.: Outcome of Russian energy embargo for Germans predictedSinceFebruary 24, oil prices have shot up to levels unseen since 2008. And while they have ebbed in recent weeks, black gold is still far more expensive than before the start of the conflict, with one barrel of Brent crude oil going for more than $111 on Thursday.Gas tariffs have also followed the upward trend, with all of the above translating into higher energy bills and gas prices for both individuals and businesses across Western Europe and North America. The increased cost of transportation has had a knock-on effect, leading to higher prices for groceries and other goods.Britain, which in early March announced it would phase out all Russian oil imports by the end of the year, is no exception in terms of skyrocketing fuel prices.The fuel spokesman for British automotive services company RAC, Simon Williams, told the media that “March 2022 will go down in the history books as one of the worst months ever when it comes to pump prices.” He also said that “to describe the current situation facing drivers at the forecourt as ‘bleak’” would be “something of an understatement.”Figures released on Wednesday indicate that inflation in the UK hit the 7% year-on-year mark in March – the highest level since 1992.Officials in Britain acknowledged early on after the start of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine that sanctions on Moscow would result in economic blowback and hurt the UK, too. London went ahead with the punitive measures regardless, with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss arguing that the price would be much higher if Russia took over Ukraine.Speaking on February 27, Truss emphasized that the “pain that we will face in the United Kingdom is nothing like the pain that people in Ukraine are currently facing.”The UK, along with the US, EU, Canada, Japan, Australia, and several other nations have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, targeting, among other things, its central bank’s assets, a number of top commercial banks, and entire industries. Somecountries have announced plans to phase out Russian energy imports, oil and coal in particular.Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.

Top US general accused of corrupt lobbying — RT World News,"        Top US general accused of corrupt lobbying                        A retired four-star general lied to officials while lobbying on behalf of Qatar, the FBI said in a leaked filing            FILE PHOTO: Retired Marine General John Allen, then the top US commander in Afghanistan, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, March 20, 2012. ©                AP  J. Scott ApplewhiteFormer US Marine Corps General John Allen could face criminal charges over his alleged role in an illegal lobbying campaign for the Qatari government, according to FBI documents obtained by the Associated Press. The filing indicates the high-ranking officer misled US authorities about the nature of his work and how he stood to personally gain from his dealings with Doha.Allen provided a “false version of events” when interviewed by law enforcement about the lobbying efforts in 2020 and likely violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), the FBI said in a 77-page search warrant application seen by the AP.“There is substantial evidence that these FARA violations were willful,” wrote FBI agent Babak Adib, referring to a law requiring those working on behalf of foreign interests to register with the Justice Department and disclose their activities.The general, who took up the top post at the Brookings Institution thinktank in 2017 after leading US and NATO forces in Afghanistan under President Barack Obama, worked “behind the scenes” to influence American policy in favor of Qatar following a major diplomatic spat between the Gulf kingdom and its neighbors in 2017. However, Allen misrepresented the lobbying and failed to disclose that he was “simultaneously pursuing multimillion-dollar business deals with the government of Qatar,” Adib added.: US congressman reveals seats on committees are ‘literally’ boughtAccording to the AP, the document outlining the case against Allen “appears to have been filed in error,” but was removed from the docket on Tuesday after the outlet requested comment from federal officials. The retired general declined to speak on the filing, but previously denied working as a Qatari agent, while a spokesperson recently told the AP that he “voluntarily cooperated with the government’s investigation into this matter.”The probe into Allen comes as part of a wider investigation surrounding Richard Olson, who served as US ambassador to both the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan between 2008 and 2015. Last week, Olson pleaded guilty to federal charges linked to lobbying for Qatar, demanding to know why Allen also hadn’t been indicted, as he claims to have worked closely with the general to sway US policy. Pakistani-American businessman Imaad Zuberi, a high-profile political donor, has also been implicated in the scheme and was sentenced to 12 years in prison in February.:    Giant Ukrainian US lobbying campaign revealedSaudi Arabia, the UAE and a number of allied states broke diplomatic ties with Doha and closed their borders, airspace and waters to the country in 2017, citing Qatar’s alleged ties to terrorist groups and warmer relations with Iran. The crisis was largely resolved early last year, after Riyadh and several of its partners agreed to begin a reconciliation process under a US- and Kuwaiti-brokered deal.

She replaces Boris Johnson, who was forced to resign following a series of scandals which rocked the credibility of his government (of which Truss was a part).But she doesn’t represent a clean start or a breath of fresh air. She is a product and accumulation of the legacy he set in motion. For those disenchanted with Johnson’s policies, things are going to go from bad to worse.Johnson was known as a buffoon, albeit often in an intentional way. Before ‘Partygate’ destroyed public trust, he was for the most part likeable. His clown-like antics were an asset before they ultimately showed themselves to be a liability.: Liz Truss joins race to replace Boris Johnson, vows to help defeat RussiaLiz Truss has none of that. She is mocked, but there is a tragic element to it because the key point is she’s trying to be serious. Like when she became widely ridiculedearly on due to her obsession with cheese. But it’s not a joke for her.Truss isn’t your slightly amicable loveable buffoon, she’s a mock-up version of Margaret Thatcher with a very dangerous ideology of Brexit euphoria and nationalistic chauvinism.She is a democratic fundamentalist who has a very dogmatic understanding of the world, and has blended it into the mantra of Brexit throughout her rise to power, transforming it from a reactionary nationalist nostalgia into a neoconservative confrontationalism.Her brand is built upon overselling Britain’s capabilities, on pretending it is something it is not, and in conjunction with that striving for a heroic collision course with both China and Russia simultaneously.It has been reported that she is seeking to declare Beijing as an official threat almost instantly on obtaining office. It remains to be seen whether this is just jingoism, given that she has a record of “governing by slogan,” but even so it will ultimately serve to generate uncertainty and escalate tensions.: Media discovers Boris Johnson’s ambitionAnd one can’t readily assume she is actually competent and knows what she is doing. For the public, what is most disturbing about Truss is that her actual skills and competence to run a government are questioned by many, and she starts off with a deficit of both trust and popularity. She’s actually less popular than Johnson.Her entry into Number 10 couldn’t come at a worse time either. People aren’t going to be patient with her. Britons face skyrocketing electricity bills and living costs. The country is expected to enter recession, with many pensioners being unable to pay their electricity bills this winter.That is the price of victory in Ukraine, she will say, blaming Putin and probably Beijing too. By doubling down on an emerging Cold War with China, and refusing to compromise with Moscow, she is likely to make things much worse for the average Briton in the immediate future. She can talk tough and appear self-righteous, but she doesn’t seem to have a plan that will improve the public’s livelihoods anytime soon.: UK’s new prime minister to be revealedThat isn’t going to accelerate Britain’s revival on a global scale, as she likes to claim, but is in fact going to accelerate its decline into irrelevance. Not only will Britain be poorer, but there’s little inclination to believe a state led by her would actually be respected by others.Less than a week before Truss’ victory, it was revealed that India’s economy had overtaken the United Kingdom in terms of GDP. For Indians, surpassing their former colonial masters was a moment of celebration, showing the rise of their country.Yet for Truss, the empire isn’t over, and she doesn’t seem to understand Indians won’t accept one-sided trade terms in Britain’s favor. They don’t do trade deals on “post-imperial nostalgia.”Her tenure in office is gearing up to become a hard reality check, likely rife with chaos, recklessness and potentially even disaster. That is, unless she surprises her country and the world by pulling some ingenious ace out of her sleeve. Does she have one stashed?

In one sense, they are entitled to do so – after all, it was the dysfunctional and anti-democratic political culture they spawned over the past thirty years that brought him down.With scant loyalty to the economic and cultural traditions of the countries in which they have accumulated nearly unchecked power, these new overlords have ushered in a globalised economy that has gradually and – ever more tumultuously since the 1990s – replaced the older economic order grounded in the nation state. The previous national elites were pushed aside in most Western democracies and now maintain only limited influence culturally and within certain traditional conservative parties.All important institutions in most Western democracies have come under the control of the global elite. This includes the large transnational corporations, the financial sector, universities, the bureaucracy and professions, legal institutions, and large sections of the media. In addition to advocating an economic program that has impoverished and hollowed out the working and middle classes, their myriad ideologies – perhaps most prominent of which are catastrophic climate change, identity politics and political correctness – have decisively won the ‘culture wars’ in most Western societies.The dramatic economic and ideological changes brought about by this cohort have also fundamentally reshaped and revolutionised politics in the West. Indicative of this is that both the Democratic Party in America and the Labour party in the United Kingdom have been fully taken over by these forces, and both have long since abandoned their traditional working-class constituencies. Read moreMedia discovers Boris Johnson’s ambitionThese elites have also divided, and in some countries – such as France – completely destroyed traditional conservative and centrist parties. In the process, they have generated a powerful anti-democratic populist political backlash – personified by Donald Trump – that threatens to seriously destabilise democracy in the West.It was the historian Christopher Lasch who first pointed out the intrinsically dysfunctional and anti-democratic aspects of the political culture created by the global elites in his book ‘The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy’, published in 1994.For a brilliantly satirical account of precisely how the greed-driven global elites operate in the UK, both at a personal and institutional level, readers should consult Quentin Letts’ 2017 book ‘Patronising Bastards – How the Elites Betrayed Britain’. Boris Johnson is at heart a traditional conservative politician (not for nothing is he the biographer of Winston Churchill), so it is not surprising that, within the West’s fractured and volatile contemporary political culture, his career has been a controversial and turbulent one.Pushing through Brexit against the determined opposition of the global elites and the institutions they control – including the powerful Remainer segment of the Tory party (led by the gormless Theresa May), the former speaker of the House of Commons, the Supreme Court, and the woke establishment media – was a remarkable achievement.So too was winning the 2019 election with an eighty-seat majority that brought substantial numbers of traditional working-class voters (in the so-called “Red Wall” seats) back within the Tory party fold for the first time in decades.No contemporary British conservative politician other than Johnson could have accomplished either of these things. Paradoxically, however, it was these very achievements that the global elites could never forgive Johnson for.Johnson tried to placate them by embracing their climate change program and even their misguided foreign policy of perpetuating the conflict in Ukraine. But these concessions were never going to be enough to save him.Johnson’s poor political judgment and erratic behaviour – including his fragmented domestic political program, his sacking of Dominic Cummings, his indulging of the crassness and narcissism of his younger millennial wife, and his arrogant refusal to create a viable support base within the Conservative party – certainly played a part in his downfall.It is a moot point as to whether Johnson could have survived had he behaved differently. I suspect that he was simply incapable of doing so.What sealed Johnson’s political fate, however, was his anachronistic vision of the United Kingdom as an independent nation state that needed to integrate its displaced working class economically and politically (his “levelling up” program) – a worldview fundamentally at odds with the globalised perspective of the ruling elites.The global elites are determined to destroy the nation state and the nineteenth century bourgeois values that underpinned it – hence their fervent and ruthless commitment to transnational ideologies and organisations, most notably the European Union. They also despise the traditional working class, whose lives, values and culture they have upended, and whose economic security they have progressively destroyed over the past five decades. There is simply no place within their economic and cultural vision of a brave new world for those people that Hilary Clinton so contemptuously and revealingly described as “deplorables.” After all, didn’t this lot vote in droves for Brexit? Read moreBoris Johnson quotes the Terminator in ParliamentNow completely abandoned by traditional labour and centrist parties that once protected their interests, it is this group that has now – what other choice did it have? – turned in desperation to populist leaders such as Trump.Therein lies the root of the intractable instability and irrationality at the heart of contemporary politics in most Western democracies.Like Tolstoy’s unhappy families, each Western democracy is disintegrating in its own peculiar fashion. Johnson attempted to reverse this process in the United Kingdom by keeping working class voters within the Tory party. Now that Johnson has gone, however, these voters will desert the Tories and look for a populist alternative. This will create even more political instability and ensure that the Conservative Party cannot win the next election.One aspect of this process of political disintegration is the poor quality of politician that it inevitably throws up.The last thing that the global elites want are politicians of real stature; rather, they seek pliable non-entities that simply mouth their ideologies endlessly, and who can be controlled and dismissed when and as the elites see fit.Johnson, for all his manifold faults, was a genuine political leader – and virtually uncontrollable.Rational political discourse and debate is now impossible. It is the global elites that in the West created this irrational mode of politics, in which opponents are not debated but only “cancelled” – as Johnson has been. It is now standard practice to use minor transgressions against the canons of political correctness – sensationalised ad nauseam by a compliant and debauched media – to depose political leaders. This is precisely what happened in Johnson’s case.What were the egregious crimes that necessitated Johnson’s political cancelling? He and his staff at Number 10 had a few late-night drinks in breach of the Covid lockdown regulations (for which they later paid the requisite fines); and Johnson appointed an obscure MP party whip against whom historical allegations of sexual impropriety (some dating back to 2005) had been made. Johnson is also alleged to have lied about both matters.These are not serious offences in any meaningful sense. But such ‘crimes’ contravene the deep-seated puritanism and narcissistic eagerness to be offended that are at the heart of the elites’ politically correct worldview.Read moreThree candidates remain in race to replace JohnsonThese are mere hypocritical pretences for ‘cancellation’ – simply the ‘justification’ for the vituperative political campaign that the Labour Party and the Remainer faction of his own party waged against Johnson for months. A complicit and woke media did the rest.Tony Blair took the UK into an unlawful war in Iraq that led to nearly a million deaths, but the elites took that in stride. Having a few drinks late at night, however, apparently requires the dismissal of a conservative prime minister.As to the consequences of Johnson’s sacking, we only have to take a glance at the politicians who emerged as his potential replacement as prime minister.Five candidates presented themselves for approval in the first two televised debates. Having observed them, Jonathan Swift’s epigram came immediately to mind:“When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.”Such a group of political dullards has rarely been assembled in one room. None of them could possibly lead the Tories to an election victory in two years’ time.Let us describe the leading candidates in turn.Rishi Sunak is a failed chancellor and multi-millionaire who previously worked for Goldman Sachs. His wife is even wealthier than he is, and until recently had arranged her affairs such that she paid no tax at all in the UK. Sunak preaches the virtues of austerity to the average Briton. Like Johnson, Sunak also breached the Covid regulations and was fined. It was Sunak’s mutinous resignation from the cabinet that triggered Johnson’s resignation. A more typical representative of the global elite one could not find – even Quentin Letts could not have invented him.Liz Truss, a former Remainer, of whom Alistair Campbell said this week: “Liz Truss would be so appalling as Prime Minister that it’s almost unthinkable, which means it could happen.” Journalist John Crace described her as “a politician totally without effect ….. an ideologue without ideas.”Penny Mordaunt is a failed defence secretary, who Tory peer Daniel Moylan branded this week as “incompetent.” Former Brexit minister David Frost said that she was “missing in action” when they worked together. Mordaunt was this week caught out in a blatant lie as she attempted to backpedal from her unqualified support for transgender athletes. Read moreBoris Johnson considers leaving politics – mediaThe first two televised debates – in which the candidates tore into each other like deranged pit bulls – were such unedifying spectacles that this week’s third debate was cancelled at the behest of Sunak and Truss, no doubt in order to preserve whatever small shreds of credibility and dignity the candidates may still have possessed.When conservative commentator Peter Hitchens was asked this week who his favourite candidate was, he replied: “What is your favourite disease?” Does anyone seriously believe that any of them can unify a Tory party that has been torn apart by Johnson’s political assassination?The new prime minister will be selected by a vote of the 160,000 Tory party members – rather than the entire British electorate – and on Wednesday the party unsurprisingly selected Sunak and Truss as the final two candidates who will vie for that vote. In deposing Johnson, a serious political crisis has been created – Nicola Sturgeon and Sinn Fein cannot believe their luck – that can only hasten the demise of democracy in the UK.Flawed though he was, Johnson will leave office with a record of substantial achievement behind him – “mission largely accomplished, for now” as he jauntily put it in his bravura farewell speech in the Commons this week. (Pointedly, arch Remainer Theresa May refused to applaud Johnson’s speech.)It is absolutely certain, however, that none of the dunces that joined together to depose Boris Johnson will ever will ever find themselves in the position of departing office with such an array of accomplishments.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/559583-truss-sunak-johnson-uk/,2022,7,27
Ireland accuses British of ‘vandalism’ — RT World News,"        Ireland accuses British of ‘vandalism’                        London’s plan to scrap the post-Brexit trade agreement would seriously damage Northern Ireland’s economy, Micheal Martin has said            Boris Johnson (R) greets Micheal Martin (L) on the steps of Hillsborough Castle in Belfast, Northern Ireland, August 13, 2020 © AFP  Brian Lawless Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin accused the UK of “economic vandalism” in a BBC interview on Sunday. Martin was responding to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to overhaul the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol, branding it the worst kind of unilateralism.A bill introduced in the House of Commons last week would dramatically overhaul the protocol, which currently mandates customs checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Should the new bill pass, goods bound forthe region would not be subject to such checks, while those bound for Ireland via the north would be checked and taxed at ports in the British exclave before heading across the border.“The legislation effectively would be severely damaging to the Northern Ireland economy, particularly in the context of the dual regulatory standards approach,” Martin told the BBC, referring to the choice that Northern Irish businesses would have to make between complying with EU or UK standards.“In effect, it represents a form of economic vandalism on Northern Ireland because if you look, any objective data is now showing that the Northern Ireland economy is doing very well,” he continued. The Irish government, he said, believes that the new legislation “is very, very worrying in terms of the actual damage it could do to key sectors of Northern Ireland economy.”Read moreUK set to break international law – Sinn Fein chiefThe British government argues that a dual regulatory approach would rid UK-Northern Ireland trade of burdensome EU regulations, while avoiding the return of a hard border betweenthe north and the rest of the Ireland , something that would be an unwelcome reminder of the North’s troubled political history.“There are certain areas where we can improve the protocol and we should continue to do that,” Martin said, calling for “substantive negotiations between the British government and the European Union.”Northern Ireland’s unionists – those who support remaining a part of the United Kingdom and view the protocol as sidelining them – have threatened not to share power with the nationalist Sinn Fein party if the protocol remains in force, and have criticized Martin for dismissing their concerns.""From day one Dublin has done what's in Dublin's interests and never once prioritized consensus in Northern Ireland,"" Democratic Unionist Party MP Sammy Wilson told the BBC. ""Not one unionist MP or MLA supports the protocol but instead of Dublin trying to understand or recognise our objections, they repeatedly lecture us, talk down to us and demand we change our mind.”Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald, whose party represents Irish nationalist interests, has said that Britain’s proposal constitutes “a breach of international law” and would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of bloodshed in Northern Ireland.

What the historic China-Arab summits mean for the Middle East — RT World News,"        What the historic China-Arab summits mean for the Middle East                        Xi Jinping’s visit to Saudi Arabia signals a desire by Arab nations to hedge their bets with stronger partnerships beyond the US            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystChinese President Xi Jinping, right, shakes hands with Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz, Governor of Riyadh, after his arrival in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2022. ©                Saudi Press Agency via APChinese leader Xi Jinping has undertakenan official visit to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Here, he is set to attend a number of summits including a China-Saudi Summit, an unprecedented China-Arab States Summit and a China-Gulf Cooperation Council (China-GCC) summit. The meetings will involve 14 other heads of states from the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, and more.To describe the visit as a “milestone” in China’s relations with the Middle East, as one Arab diplomat apparently did, is accurate. It is a sign of a strategic shift towards a multipolar world. The sides come together in merging a shared set of economic, strategic and security objectives, showing the United States that it cannot dictate to Middle East states who they should and should not have partnerships with.For most of recent history, the states of the Arab world have been understood to be divided in two groups. On the one hand, there are “clients” of the West, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar. On the other hand, there are outright enemies, including Bashar Assad’s Syria and the Iraq of Saddam Hussein. This is because, in the early 20th century, Western nations designed a Middle East that would supplement their hegemony over itself. Their goal was to create a series of client states who served their interests in terms of access to energy and military, while supressing any revolutionary states that sought to oppose Western dominance in the region.Read moreUS and China must avoid ‘collision’ course –XiWith this arrangement, the states of the Persian Gulf grew tremendously wealthy through a mutual agreement to provide energy to Western nations in exchange for projecting their military influence across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has been a critical partner of the United States, while the United Arab Emirates gives air-base access to several Western countries. The West preserves the independence of these countries, while helping them contain revisionist neighbors such as Ba’athist-era Iraq and contemporary Iran.But the world is changing. The partnership between the West and Arab states is borne out of mutual strategic interests, not ideology or fraternity. They are business partners, not allies, and throughout the past several decades the United States has demonstrated its penchant for causing enormous upheaval, devastation and destruction across the Middle East which has been disadvantageous to all. While the US may have supported its partners in the Gulf, it has always been an obvious and pressing factor that Washington is only really interested in its own hegemony, and has no true respect for the sovereignty, culture or interests of the countries of the region. What happens, after all, when the world moves away from oil? Saudi Arabia and similar states may have been tacitly supportive of many things the US has done throughout the Middle East, but we should remember, they are monarchic states based on a conservative rendering of Islam, and do not share the American concept of “human rights.”Therefore, the rise of China has proven to be critically important for Arab states. Beijing’s emergence as a superpower is prompting countries in the Middle East to diversify their strategic objectives and balance themselves away from a decades-long Western dependency, which can incur many liabilities down the road. China is different to the United States – not only is it a much larger consumer of oil and gas (because of its population size and sparse resources), but also wields a diplomatic position of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and a respect for national sovereignty. For Middle East countries, faced with decades of US-led campaigns and interference around them, this is extremely valuable.Read more21st century belongs to the Asia-Pacific – Xi JinpingAs a result, as the geopolitical picture of the world has turned towards multipolarity and competition between the US, China and others, Arab countries have embraced China as a new benefactor which can bring substantial economic, diplomatic, and strategic benefits over the previous arrangements they had. While this does not signify “hostility” to the West, and we should expect Arab countries to keep dealing with their current partners, it nonetheless signals a move away from Western dominance over the region and a belief that “the best of both worlds” is ultimately better. The US previously sought to impose many demands regarding China on Arab countries, such as trying to coerce the UAE to ban Huawei from its 5G networks. Abu Dhabi told Washington where to go. Beyond the China matter, the issue of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has also been a growing sore point between the US and Arab states, especially on the issue of oil production. The common theme between both instances? The US believed it could force its unilateral will on Arab countries, only to be rebuffed. The China-Arab summits thus reflect the shift in mood – the Arab states are ready to diversify and expand their partnerships to entrench their positions, so that countries such as America may ultimately be forced to accept them as equals.The Arab states were only ever partners, not allies to the US, and had no fundamental loyalty beyond the factor of who could provide their states with the most benefits, turning a blind eye to decades of US-led wars and destruction across the region. Now, the rise of China has signaled a new source of wealth, opportunity, and security for the Arab World, leading them to hedge their bets.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/567882-xi-visit-saudi-arabia/,2022,12,9
Australia announces response to tensions in Asia — RT World News,"        Australia announces response to tensions in Asia                        Canberra will conduct the first major review of country’s military preparedness in years            ©Getty Images                  Peter Wallis  StringerAustralia announced on Wednesday it will conduct a Defense Strategic Review of its Armed Forces for the first time in a decade. It comes amid heightened Asia-Pacific tensions over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-governed island of Taiwan, made despite Chinese warnings.Speaking at a press conference in Canberra, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the review is intended to “prepare Australia to effectively respond to the changing regional and global strategic environment and ensure that Defence's capability and force structure is fit for purpose, affordable, and delivers the greatest return on investment.”The review will define the country’s defense posture for approximately a decade, and will be led by Professor Stephen Smith, a former defense and foreign affairs minister, along with Angus Houston, a former chief of the Defence Force.Speaking at the same press conference, Houston explained that the security circumstances “have changed dramatically over the recent past,” and becoming the worst he has seen in his “career and lifetime.”“A land war in Europe, all sorts of issues in north-east Asia, particularly around Taiwan, east China Sea, issues in South-East Asia and issues up on the Himalayan border and northern India,” he explained, mentioning also “disruptive technologies coming into play” as another security threat.When asked how significant this review is in the context “of a more belligerent China in the region,” the prime minister explained that the context is “well-known.”: China signs new deal with Pacific nation“We live in an era where there’s strategic competition and increased tension in our region. And where China has taken a more aggressive posture in the region,” Albanese said.He added, though, that when it comes to Taiwan, the Australian government’s position has not changed. Australia supports the One China principle but maintains unofficial diplomatic ties with Taiwan through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates.“We don’t want to see any unilateral change to the status quo. And we’ll continue to work with partners to promote peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” he said.Last year, then-Defense Minister Peter Dutton warned that conflict over Taiwan involving China can’t be ruled out. He stressed, however, that the government is focused on having “good relations” with Beijing.Australia’s relationship with China has been deteriorating drastically in the last year. Canberra has condemned Beijing’s move to sign a security pact with the Solomon Islands, a Pacific nation located about 1,000 miles (1,700km) from Australia’s northeast coast. Australia claimed that China wants to use the agreement to establish a military foothold in the area – something that Beijing denies. Australia’s new Labor government has vowed to “step up” the country’s own presence in the Pacific, after making China a major campaign issue during the recent election.China, in turn, has been accusing Australia and its partners of encouraging an “arms race” in the South Pacific region. In May, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that the Australian government had not consulted with its other partners last year when it unveiled the AUKUS deal, a security pact involving Australia, the UK and US that paves the way for Canberra to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.The review will also consider how Australia’s capabilities can work in cooperation with the United States, the United Kingdom and other key partners.

The defiant move from Saudi Arabia, however, may be much more complex than meets the eye.Washington has been up in arms ever since the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a long-time US partner in the Middle East, pushed for oil production to be slashed at an OPEC+ meeting earlier this October. The consequences were immediately evident – as Biden heads his party into the November midterm elections, oil prices will not drop, which hurts his hopes of defeating the Republicans at the polls. Prominent Democrats began launching tirades against the Kingdom, outraged that the Saudis’ move could affect the election results.The decision of OPEC+ earlier this month to cut production to a low not seen since 2020 was instantly characterized by Washington as Saudi Arabia taking the side of Russia over the West. To make things worse for Biden, Riyadh has reportedly expressed interest in joining the BRICS economic alliance, currently composed of South Africa, Brazil, Russia, India, and China.Saudi Arabia has denied that it made any decisions in order to side with Russia, saying it was especially “astonished” over claims that it was taking a stance against Ukraine.Read moreSaudi Arabia reveals US pressure over oil cutAlthough the Saudi decision to cut production is undoubtedly a blow to the West, especially as Europe continues to suffer energy shortages, the move was not likely meant as a political stance on the conflict between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. If anything, the message can be interpreted as an anti-Democratic Party stance, rather than anti-American.Although the rhetoric has shifted in Washington to reflect the original position of the Biden administration when it took office, now focusing on human rights violations and the autocratic nature of the Saudi state, the real reason for this is not genuine concern. Biden was even reported to have asked the Saudi government for a concession so that the oil production cut would not go into effect until after the election, according to Riyadh. But with attempts to postpone the OPEC+ decision proving futile, the US president is now forced to address the issue of oil prices in order to salvage votes his party risks losing over the issue ahead of November 8.The Republican Party is clearly favorable to the Saudis’ own regional agenda, with former President Donald Trump making the Kingdom the destination of his first foreign trip in office. Trump, who still holds significant sway over the Republican Party, was a great ally of both the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates when in office. Through lobbying efforts and other forms of pressure on the Republican Party, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi seemed content with the results they received. Notably, Thomas Barrack, who served as an unofficial Trump administration adviser, has been accused of being a foreign agent for the Emirati government over his role in influencing the former president on major foreign policy issues, and may have greatly reshaped the approach that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have taken for their own regional power.Then there is the hypocritical approach of the Biden administration. The US president claimed, in his first address on his administration’s foreign policy agenda, that he was going to hold Riyadh to account for its human rights violations and work to bring the war in Yemen to an end. Biden stated that offensive weapons and other relevant arms sales to Saudi Arabia would be canceled, yet approved weapon sales later that same year.Come 2022, the war in Yemen is far from over and Biden ended up traveling to Saudi Arabia in order to repair US-Saudi ties. The July trip included a sit-in at an Arab Summit meeting, where the president vowed to not “walk away” from the Middle East. This was coupled with word of Washington readying itself to reconsider sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia once again, despite the trip not resulting in any tangible benefits for the US global andor regional agendas. In fact, around a week prior to the latest OPEC+ oil production cut, Saudi-US relations had hit a new high point as reports emerged of the encouragement of US investors to go to Saudi Arabia; this came after the Kingdom had been involved in a Russia-Ukraine prisoner exchange deal.In response to calls from prominent Democrats to cut ties, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, listed off the following elements that bind US-Saudi relations, in an interview with CNN:Read moreAmericans should know if US pressured Middle East ally – congressman“We have almost 80,000 Americans living and working inside Saudi Arabia. We have a very strong trade and investment relationship. We work very closely in regards to ensuring our common interests, whether it is to bring peace to Yemen, whether it’s to bring peace between Israelis and Arabs, whether it’s to stabilize Afghanistan, whether it’s to reintegrate Iraq into the Arab fold, whether it’s to bring stability to the horn of Africa, whether it’s to bring stability and peace in Libya and the G5 countries of the Sahel, whether it’s to fight extremism and terrorism. Those interests are permanent and those interests are tremendous.”The reason this statement is notable is its clear demonstration of the power that the US can harness through its relationship with Riyadh. The two sides have been joined at the hip since the discovery of oil in 1938, with this relationship greatly improving following the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979. However, Saudi Arabia has not sat back and allowed the US to simply take advantage of it, buying up major parts of the US oil market itself and ensuring that its impact on regional affairs has cemented its role as a primary regional player, not just an international gas station.While Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations, committed domestically and abroad, are abhorrent, the Biden administration clearly is not interested in them. This is why US-Saudi relations have deteriorated only now, when oil prices and partisan electoral issues are at stake, representing yet another embarrassment for the White House. During Biden’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the president reportedly attempted to bring up the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Asthe Saudi account goes, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman countered Biden by pointing to the Israeli killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq by US forces – the message being: Don’t pretend to be something you are not. US-Saudi relations are here to stay, short of Washington attempting to fuel another regime change war, a move that would prove catastrophic for US interests.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/565260-saudi-us-biden-oil/,2022,10,25
"Stay at home, traveller: Sanctions against Russia have helped cripple the global tourism industry — RT World News","        Stay at home, traveller: Sanctions against Russia have helped cripple the global tourism industry                        The price of tourism has risen several times in the face of the global economic crisis and Western attempts to weaken Moscow            ©                Getty ImagesAscentPKS Media Inc.International tourism is caught in a perfect storm caused by the simultaneous effect of the sanctions war unleashed against Russia and the associated increase in energy prices. That's added to an uncontrolled ultrasoft monetary policy and the subsequent surge in inflation. Meanwhile, added to the mix are the introduction of visa barriers and the desire to close borders, plus remaining quarantine restrictions in some of the world’s key economies amidst the ongoing spread of viral diseases.In a situation where it seems like things can’t get any worse, numerous experts are increasingly warning that the global economy needs to prepare for difficult times. Given the situation, the simple joy of traveling may soon become a luxury, and international tourism, which has become a mass phenomenon in recent decades, could return to the status of a privilege for the elite.The current geopolitical conflict between Russia and the West has had multiple consequences. Already, the unprecedented sanctions war launched against Moscowhas dealt painful blows to the key pillars of modern globalization: International trade and theglobal financial markets.Read moreWestern media says Russia blew up Nord Stream. But why would Moscow destroy pipelines it spent billions of dollars building?Trade restrictions against the world’s sixth-largest economy, which is also one of its leading commodity exporters, have spurred a global inflationary spiral. The prices of food, commodities, electricity, and utilities are all rising. Of course, one reason alone can’t account for such a large-scale crisis. The monetary policy of the world’s central banks has also played an important role.The credibility of the modern dollar-centric financial system has been further undermined by the freezing of Moscow’s gold and foreign exchange reserves and the funds of Russian companies and citizens held abroad, as well as the blocking of banks’ foreign assets.At the same time, the growing fragmentation of the world economy is taking place against the backdrop of a new phenomenon – a rupture in human connections.The tourism sector has turned out to be the most sensitive to this. The UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has forecast that the number of international trips made by the end of this year may amount to 55-70 percent of the pre-pandemic level of 2019. The industry was still reeling from quarantine restrictions when it was suddenly confronted with new challenges in the form of rising fuel prices and air travel, as well as visa barriers between individual regions.                       © UnsplashNorbu Gyachung                                                        The tourism sector’s problems threaten to lead to a number of consequences, from damaging business and bankrupting dependent companies to lowering the quality of life of people who find a periodic change of scenery important for preserving their mental health.Why is Tourism Important for the Economy?Read morePorts, mines, agriculture: What can new regions give Russia’s economy?The tourism industry’s contribution to global GDP in 2019 was 10.4 percent, according to a report from the World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), prepared jointly with Oxford Economics. Two years later, in 2021, this figure had already dropped to 6.6 percent. In 2019, travelers spent $1.7 trillion during trips, accounting for almost 7 percent of international exports and 27.4 percent of export services. Two years later, in 2021, tourist spending had dropped to $700 million. That's a drop of $1 trillion, which is comparable to the GDP of a country like the Netherlands.Before the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of international tourism accounted for 10.6 percent of all jobs globally (334 million), as well as one in four new jobs. In 2021, 290 million people were employed in the tourism sector. A simple comparison will make it easier to comprehend the scale of this reduction. A total of 40 million people have lost jobs in tourism – a figure roughly equivalent to the entire population of Argentina.                       © Getty ImagesMalte Mueller                                                        The specter of even more job losses still looms, as many of these employees are being supported by special government programs. However, employment in international travel is unlikely to be maintained if the industry doesn’t fully recover, the WTTC report emphasizes. The world has not returned to its former self, and connections have not been fully restored. Political risks continue to put pressure on international markets, while the ‘new norm’ has yet to be determined.The Main VictimsRussian tourists have already felt the impact of international travel complications to a greater extent than most other Europeans. The tourist flow from Russia to the rest of the continent this year hasdeclined sharply, according to Maya Lomidze, the executive director of the Association of Tour Operators of Russia. Difficulties in obtaining visas, as well as the increased cost and duration of air travel, are the main reasons for this precipitous drop. In the first seven months of this year, organized visits by Russian tourists to other European countries amounted to only 5-10 percent of the volume during pre-Covid times.Read moreSyria was a rehearsal for the struggle between Russia and the West in Ukraine: Here's why they are very different conflictsIn February, the European Union, like the United States, banned direct flights to and from Russia, and Russian airspace was reciprocally closed. The travel time from Moscow to New York has increased significantly and now amounts to more than a day. Flying from Moscow to Vienna, via another destination, now takes at least eight hours, as opposed to the previous two and a half. In addition to becoming longer, flights have also become a lot more expensive. A one-way from Moscow to Vienna now costs about $3,500, having skyrocketed over the past few years. It previously could be had for at leasttwentytimes less.The Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Estonia, and Latvia have stopped issuing tourist visas to Russians and many others are delaying the deadlines for submitting documents. For example, in September, the nearest free slot offered by the Italian visa center in Moscow was in November, and there are no free places at all at France’s visa center in the near future.However, Russian tourists had become accustomed to difficulties in obtaining visas long before this year. Shuttered consulates and increasing visa refusals have been clear signs of the faltering relations and trust between Moscow and Washington since 2016. As a result, there were only about 130,000 departures from Russia to the US last year – three times fewer than in 2014.                   FILE PHOTO.

For example, Thailand expects about one million Russian tourists this year. Domestic Russian tourism has also been a beneficiary, with Crimea topping the list of the country’s most popular destinations, according to surveys.The Ricochet EffectLast year, the number of foreign tourist trips from Russia amounted to 18 million, two and a half times fewer than in the pre-Covid year of 2019.This year, the figures for outbound tourism will be farlower.Statistics in certain areas are quite stunning. The number of Russian tourists who traveled to the United States from April to June decreased year-on-year by more than 900 times – from 36,700 to 39 people.According to Andrey Barkhota, an independent travel expert, “a strong ruble makes outbound tourism more attractive to Russians, but geopolitical barriers have prevented them from taking advantage of this. This, in turn, has forced Russians to reorient their tourist routes to domestic destinations or countries that have not imposed barriers so far.”Read more'Jiving today, accused of treason tomorrow': How Russian jazz survived communist repression to celebrate 100 yearsThe absence of Russian tourists has led to a loss of profits for Western resorts. According to Euromonitor International, Russian tourists account for one percent of global travel expenditure. Russians spent $9.1 billion abroad in 2021, but they are forecast to contribute less than $6.9 billion to the global tourism industry this year due to the current difficulties. While this figure may not seem critical, for some regions it is quite a tangible amount.“The loss of wealthy Russian tourists will not undermine the recovery of the industry, but it will deal serious damage to many countries: from Europe and the Caribbean to Thailand,” the company notes.Some European resorts are already feeling the effects of the dearth of Russian guests. Italy would hoped to have welcomed as many Russian tourists this year as it did in 2019, when 1.7 million travelers spent about a billion euros there. However, this year, the city of Romealone is set to lose about €150 million from their absence.Tourists from Russia have always had a reputation for spending a lot while on vacation. Spain’s Institute of Tourism has estimated that the average Russian shells out about €175 per day while traveling. This is much more than the thrifty Germans, for example, who spend about €138 euros per day, or the stingy French, who cough up only €99. Previously, the countrywelcomed over 1.3 million Russian visitors a year.                       © Getty ImagesFilippoBacci                                                        While Finland was the third most popular destination for Russians before Covid, when 3.6 million people visited in 2019, they only went to the Scandinavian country a little more than 230,000 times last year. Last month, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin supported the idea of restricting visa issuance to Russian citizens. This despite the fact that the Finnish authorities themselves estimate that they will lose €600 million per year by doing so, which is unsurprising given that Russians accounted for 19 percent of Finland’s income from international tourism.Cyprus is expected to suffer comparable losses. Up until recently, about two million Russian tourists visited the island’s resorts annually, injecting about €290 million into the country’s economy, which amounts to a fifth of its income from tourism.Everything’s ExpensiveAs a result, Western Europeans are hoping for visitors from other countries – such asthe UK, for example. In the pre-crisis period, over 70 million people from the United Kingdom visited the EU annually, but that number decreased by more than four times in 2021, to 16 million visits.Read moreGas shortages, freezing temperatures, firewood hoarding: Just how bad could things get this winter?However, the difficulties of this year, some of which can be explained by geopolitical problems, have clearly taken a notable toll on the pocketbooks of British consumers. With record inflation amid soaring electricity prices, falling real wages, and the rising cost of air travel, the worsening cost-of-living crisis has become obvious to Brits, forcing them to choose domestic rather than international travel. To make matters worse, continuous disruptions in airport operations have significantly worsened the quality of trips. It is not surprising that, even according to the most optimistic forecasts, outbound tourism from the UK, most of which went to other parts of Europe, will only recover by 2024.The increase in the cost of flights is a global trend. One of the main reasons for this is the rising cost of oil and petroleum products. Theyhave risen significantly since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and continue to remain high, and this has only been exacerbated by the sanctions imposed on Russia.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that, “without a doubt,” airfare prices will rise as fuel costs do. According to IATA CEO WillieAccording to IATA CEO Willie Walsh, “these costs will be passed on to consumers.” Michael O’Leary, the head of the low-cost airline Ryanair, hasannounced that the age of cheap flights is over. Moreover, he stressed that the cost of plane tickets is likely to rise over the next five years because flights have become “too cheap” to make a profit, as industry costs skyrocket.                       © Getty ImagesColorblind Images LLC                                                        Not only has air travel become more expensive, but hotel prices in Europe have also taken off, increasing by more than 20% compared to 2019 in some areas. Meanwhile, the cost of car rentalshas doubled over the past three years due to a shortage of new cars caused by Covid-related factory shutdowns. Many large car rental companies reduced their fleet during the pandemic. The rising cost of an international travel package, which oftenincludes ‘flight-hotel-car rental’, is quashing demand from prospective tourists.Statistics from the US seem to buck the global trend. Domestic tourism is under pressure there, as prices for domestic flights rose by 50 percent in the first half of this year and still remain high. But the demand for foreign trips, especially to Europe, is growing in the States.According to Mr. Barkhota, this rising demand is not so much an indicator of consumer confidence as of the current situation in the currency and financial markets: “This year the dollar exchange rate has risen by 15 percent against the British and Euro currencies... which stimulates the influx of tourists from the United States to Europe.”Geopolitical tensions and the curtailment of monetary incentives to support the economy and financial markets, coupled with the growing Federal Reserve rate, have increased demand for the dollar. Europe hasn't been so affordable and cheap for Americans in the past 20 years.However, taking into account all the global trends, these trips to Europe may be the last breath of fresh air for US citizens.By Yulia Bokova, RT editorFeature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/563269-why-tourism-getting-more-expensive/,2022,10,4
Global nuclear weapons spending calculated — RT World News,"        Global nuclear weapons spending calculated                        During every minute of 2021 the world spent $156,841 on nuclear weapons, new report says            © Getty Images  imaginima Global atomic weapon spending saw a significant increase in 2021 according to the latest International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) report published on Tuesday.In just one year, the nine nuclear-armed nations - US, China, Russia, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and the United Kingdom – spent a total of $82.4 billion on upgrading and maintaining their estimated 13,000 nuclear weapons, marking a 9% hike from the year before, according to ICAN’s estimates.The report, which is ICAN’s third annual summary of global nuclear spending and is titled ‘Squandered: 2021 Global Nuclear Weapons Spending,’ highlights that in total, the world spent a combined $156,842 every single minute of 2021 on weapons of mass destruction, amid an ongoing pandemic and rising global food insecurity.ICAN details exactly how much each of the nine countries spent on atomic weapons, lists the companies that profited, and the lobbyists hired to keep nuclear weapons in business.The United States turned out to be by far the biggest spender on nuclear armaments in 2021, having spent $44.2 billion – four times more than the next in line. China was the only other country to exceed the ten-billion-dollar mark, at $11.7 billion spent, while Russia holds third place at $8.6 billion. The UK spent $6.8 billion, France, $5.9 billion, and countries like India, Israel and Pakistan each spent a little over a billion on their arsenals in 2021. In last place is North Korea, which spent $642 million.Read moreRisk of nuclear arms use highest in decades – watchdogThe report goes on to question why and how these countries spent so much on nuclear weaponry amid myriad global issues such as food and energy shortages, but comes to the conclusion that the biggest driver of nuclear weapon spending was not security concerns but, rather, business interests.Certain US military contractors have allegedly made a fortune from nuclear weapons-related contracts according to ICAN, and these companies spend a big chunk of their income to hire lobbyists and fund think tanks that encourage politicians to spend even more on weapons of mass destruction.According to the report, Honeywell International made $6.2 billion from nuclear tenders in 2021 and spent an additional $7 million on lobbying. Northrop Grumman got $5 billion and used $11.6 million for lobbying. Lockheed Martin received $1.9 billion from the industry and spent $16.9 million on lobbying.The authors of the report note that after examining thousands of contracts, reports and lobby disclosures, they estimate that over a dozen private companies received a total of $30.2 billion in nuclear weapon contracts in 2021.“Those companies then turned around and spent $117 million lobbying decision makers to spend more money on defense. And they also spent up to $10 million funding most of the major think tanks that research and write about policy solutions about nuclear weapons,” wrote ICAN.Read moreMoscow responds to idea of sending nukes to UkraineThe report goes on to note that all this spending has done nothing to deter any sort of conflict and that recent geopolitical events in Europe have only served to further line the pockets of those who are tied to the nuclear weapons industry.“We were told that the billions invested in thousands of weapons of mass destruction with the power to destroy the world many times over was the price to pay for peace in Europe. Instead, those billions went to line the pockets of the powerful who profit from the production of weapons of mass destruction.”The authors stress that the report demonstrates that “nuclear weapons don’t work” as they have failed to deter conflict in Europe.“This is why we need multilateral disarmament more than ever.

Biden will make his first trip to the Middle East next month with visits to Israel, the West Bank and Saudi Arabia. ©                AP PhotoPatrick Semansky, FileAmid record gas prices in the United States, the administration of President Joe Biden announced that he will visit Saudi Arabia during his first Middle East trip as president. Biden’s decision to visit the kingdom, which is perennially accused of human rights violations, shows the inherent contradictions that drive the administration’s foreign policy.Biden’s foreign policy has two fundamental pillars, at least in terms of messaging. The first is that US foreign policy should puthuman rights at the center while the other is that US diplomatic relations should help average Americans, claiming to meld foreign and domestic policies. The application of these two has proven extremely challenging, which could be described as consistently inconsistent.The trip to Saudi Arabia aims to reduce average Americans’ prices at the pump. That is clear. But it’s hard to square this circle when Biden had previously saidhe would not speak with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s foremost power player –but now says he will meet with him under these circumstances, though, he claims, not one-on-one.Read moreBiden should ‘shun’ Saudi prince – congressmanThe prince, who goes by MBS, is credibly accused of being behind the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi-born US resident and Washington Post columnist who was dismembered in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, Turkey. MBS is also believed to be the main orchestrator of the Saudi-led war on Yemen, which has featured one of the most brutal and indiscriminate bombing campaigns in memory.It’s hard to see how Biden can claim to be putting human rights at the center of his agenda while meeting with the likes of MBS. This after his administration just wrapped up the latest Summit of the Americas, which excluded the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela based on human rights concerns, while also including such countries as Colombia and Brazil – bastions of human rights, no doubt.Speaking of Venezuela, while the US considers it a violator of human rights and democratic norms, and also doesn’t even recognize Nicolas Maduro as the legitimate president, Washington has started to ease sanctions on Venezuela and even held high-level meetings with the government in Caracas. For example, Washington is reportedly planning to allow Venezuela to ship oil to Europe to plug up holes left by the exclusion of Russian crude.We can see that US foreign policy is consistently inconsistent, mostly in that it tries to remain true to certain principles but immediately betrays them when reality sets in. It shows that the proclaimed US ideals are out of touch with geopolitical realities, and would inevitably hurt average Americans if actually implemented to their logical conclusion.At the same time, however, it’s debatable to what extent helping average Americans is even one of the main priorities of Biden’s foreign policy. In the Middle East, for example, the Biden administration is sacrificing progress made on the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or the Iran nuclear deal) in pursuit of its most recent Middle East peace plan.Read moreUS-Saudi relations nearing ‘breaking point’ – mediaBut the details of this plan reveal that there is certainly nothing peaceful about it. On June 9, Congress introduced bipartisan legislation that would see the Pentagon coordinate air defenses with Israel and a number of Arab states against Iran. It will also see tons of weapons funneled into the region – in spite of the fact that a March report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute showed weapons imports beginning to level off.It is hard to see how throwing a wrench into a process that would help halt nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, opting instead to just funnel weapons into the region and whip up an anti-Iran military alliance, actually helps the American people. On the contrary, it seems to only be beneficial to military contractors that inherently profit from destabilization and catastrophe.Biden’s foreign policy is consistently inconsistent. The administration claims to follow certain principles and norms, like human rights, yet abandons them when the political fallout would be too great. It’s clear this is the case, as Biden’s Democratic Party faces a stiff challenge from Republicans in this year’s midterm elections – all while the US economy is facing record inflation and a looming recession.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/557624-biden-trip-middle-east/,2022,6,22

However, despite the horrific bloodshed inflicted on the Iraqi people, the Western public seem to have forgotten so many of the lessons that should have been taken away from the disaster that was the Iraq War.In the build-up to the war on Iraq, Americans were told that eliminating Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, was necessary for world peace. This was due to his alleged possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) as well as his alleged links with Al-Qaeda, among a number of other claims about Hussein’s genocidal ambitions. Britain’s then-prime minister, Tony Blair, even likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler; this was at a time when anti-Middle Eastern sentiment was high and the 911 attacks were ripe in the minds of the Western public, who had been informed by then-US President George W. Bush that the ‘war on terror’ was akin to a‘crusade’.It turned out that almost none of the major allegations about Saddam Hussein were true, despite the Iraqi president’s other crimes against humanity. Yet,with no evidence, Western media fell in line and presented the invasion of Iraq as a just war, despite the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in Geneva stating that it constituted a war of aggression and a flagrant violation of international law prior to the invasion occurring.Read moreIran claims responsibility for missile attack – reportsLikely due in large part to the media coverage at the time, which had demonized everything Middle Eastern and Muslim, US public support for invading Iraq prior to ‘Operation Iraqi Liberation’ was between 52-64%, jumping up to 72% support on invasion day.In the first two months of the ‘Shock and Awe’ invasion of Iraq, more than 7,186 Iraqi civilians were said to have been killed. Yet, at the time, Western media outlets were celebrating the US-UK victory as if none of this death and destruction had taken place, never truly asking where the alleged WMD were. A BBC reporter, Andrew Marr,said on April 9 of British PM Tony Blair that “He said they would be able to take Baghdad without a bloodbath and in the end the Iraqis would be celebrating. And on both of those points he has been proven conclusively right.”The blindly pro-US-UK government coverage went on, despite reports of US and UK war crimes. For example, on April 2, 2003, US aircraft struck a Red Crescent maternity hospital in Baghdad, resulting in a massacre according to The Guardian.Within less than two years of the invasion, it is said that as many as 100,000 innocent Iraqi civilians were killed, yet George W. Bush still managed to get re-elected in 2004. This was with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) not granting permission for the invasion, countless reports of civilian targets being hit, and calls from anti-war voices for the prosecution of Bush and Blair for war crimes.On October 6, 2003, Time Magazine was still running cover for the Bush administration, only offering small criticisms of how President Bush miscalculated“fixing Iraq,” whilst The Economist went with a headline in May that read:‘Now, the waging of peace’, which was endorsing the idea of nation-building in Iraq and ignoring the alleged war crimes.Eventually, all the major news outlets in the West, including the likes of CNN, BBC, Fox News, and others, bowed their heads in shame of theirone-sided reporting on what had occurred in Iraq and what Noam Chomsky called their participation in ‘manufacturing consent’.Read moreMultiple rockets land near US consulate in Iraq – reportsPeter Van Buren, a former US State Department official based in Iraq for a year, was asked about whether the Western media had learnt its lesson from Iraq andsaid the following:“Lessons learned? No. La [‘no’ in Arabic]. Nyet [‘no’ in Russian]. As a State Department officer in 2003, I watched in horror as the mainstream press acted not only as stenographers for government lies but amplifiers of those lies, employing anonymous sources at the expense of their own credibility to create and then service a narrative demanding war. When their true editor-in-chief, George W. Bush, stood up, a mix of Ben Bradley and Lou Grant, to proclaim ‘you were either with us or with the terrorists,’ the media stifled dissent in their ranks nearly completely. In 2022, little has changed. The media again beats the drum for war, albeit this time as stenographers for the Ukrainian government’s propaganda. Almost all of the video and imagery out of Ukraine comes from their government and those anonymous sources of 2003 have been replaced by no real sourcing at all. Crushing dissent has caught up with the times, so voices for restraint are not just left off the New York Times op-ed page, they are canceled, deplatformed, and sent down the social media memory hole, unemployable as Putin-lovers.”Today, the crimes committed in Iraq are well known to the Western public, yet the former leaders of the United States and United Kingdom have never faced consequences for the chaos they caused. Not only has the war left Iraq divided, in terms of de-jure and societal ethno-religious division, but US forces are still stationed in Iraq in their thousands. NATO even announced early last year that they were expanding their own mission to 4,000 personnelin Iraq.In addition to this, Iraq has faced the rise and fall of ISIS, a sectarian Sunni-Shia war, US occupation, torture centers, and chemical weapon deployment against civilians, and this has stained the new collective memory of the new generation of Iraqis. The young generation of Iraqis now also face a corrupt Iraqi elite, installed into a confessionalist [sectarian] system of government, which has largely been based on a manufactured political culture of nepotism.Read moreProtesters mourn assassinated general by burning US flagsHas the US even been able to claim victory in Iraq after 19 years of destruction? Absolutely not. Washington is still battling to hold enough power in the country in order to combat the role of neighboring Iran, which jumped in to fill the power vacuum with its allied forces who were established to fight ISIS and Al-Qaeda.Prior to the removal of Saddam Hussein, Iraq was not a country divided on sectarian lines and did not have a problem with Al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups. The country has been torn apart since 2003 and the same media organizations which religiously took the side of Western governments are today working as the same propaganda machines. The active undermining of the Iraqi experience of war, with countless Western journalists saying things like, we should care more because the bombs are dropping on “relatively civilised” people, can be put down to racism, and it is this sort of dangerous rhetoric which enables Western audiences to ignore the alleged 6 million victims of the failed ‘war on terror’. Until the perpetrators of the Iraq War are brought to justice, the US government cannot claim the moral high ground over its adversaries, and its position on the world stage shall forever be tainted.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/552455-us-invasion-iraq-war/,2022,3,22

Washington’s request comes after a recent UN reportthat warned of possible crimes against humanity in the Chinese territory.The resolution brought forth by the US was also co-sponsored by the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway. The 47-member UNHRC will vote on the resolution this week, with Western countries apparently afraid that it might not pass. If it does, a debate on the issue will be scheduled for the council's next session in February.Indeed, a joint statement delivered by Pakistan on behalf of 68 states during the 51st session of the UNHRC called out Western countries for having double standards on the issue of human rights and stressed that Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet-related issues were strictly China’s internal affairs.Looking at the list of current council members, it appears at first glance that China has more support than the West, and 16 of these countries signed onto the aforementioned statement. So the likelihood of the US resolution being tossed out is quite high. It’s also important to note how mild the action from Washington was, given the fact that it probably knew anything more than a “discussion” would surely have zero chance of passing.Read moreUN report accuses China of ‘crimes against humanity’While the prospects of this not passing are already embarrassing enough for Washington and represents a tidal shift in global power, in a way it would almost be less embarrassing. That’s because opening up a discussion on human rights would not bode well for Uncle Sam.If we just look at the accusations commonly leveled against China in Xinjiang, such concerns as “forced labor”, “forced disappearances,” and infringements on other rights found in the UN report are commonplace in the US. Let’s take a look at some examples.Starting with “religious, cultural and linguistic identity and expression,” it’s quite obvious that a country that committed one of the worst genocides in human history, the US, ought to keep its mouth shut on this. But we should note that Washington’s genocide against the Native population and its suppression of Native identity is ongoing.Take for instance a widely reported incident involving a Native American man, Darrell House, who was at his people’s ancestral lands and got tased by a federal government agent while praying. Of course, the parks service said at the time that it was “reviewing” the incident – but such instances happen all the time. In fact, Native Americans are at the center of constitutional law debates time and time again mainly over their religious practices.Moving on to the “rights to privacy and freedom of movement,” again, we can see that the US routinely violates this. As we learned with the leaksfrom National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden, the US operates the world's largest global spy network in the world and collects bulk data on its own citizens without their consent.Read moreChina rebukes US as ‘world’s biggest human rights violator’As for freedom of movement, the case of human rights lawyer Steven Donziger is notable. He won a lawsuit where he represented Ecuadoreans against oil giant Chevron for polluting their country. Then the company fought the ruling, never paid a cent in restitution and lobbied the federal government to pursue trumped up racketeering charges against Donziger. He was under house arrest for more than two years.“Reproductive rights” have been all over the news in the States after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had established a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion. Now women’s rights are under serious threat across the country as states begin implementing punitive anti-abortion laws.“Employment and labor issues” is interesting given the fact that it is widely known that, as of last year, a full-time job in the US at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 can’t pay the rent anywhere in the country. Workplaces are also extremely unsafe, which is evident by the prevalence of Covid-19 in the country. The ongoing pandemic is, more than anything, a workplace safety issue – and the federal government allowed itself to be influenced by employers to undermine workers’ safety.Of course, there’s no one more exploited than prisoners because the US still allows for slavery as a form of punishment in its constitution. A June report from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that incarcerated workers in the US earn an average wage of between 13 to 52 cents per hour – despite producing nearly $11 billion worth of goods and services annually.Read moreChina, India and Brazil abstain in vote on US resolution, Russia vetoesThat’s, of course, well below the minimum wage – and the state can take up to 80% of this already measly pay for room and board, court costs, restitution and other fees, ironically such as prison maintenance and construction. Almost 70% of prisoners polled said they can’t afford basic necessities – and, damningly, 76% said “they are required to work or face additional punishments such as solitary confinement, denial of opportunities to reduce their sentence, and loss of family visitation.”On “issues of family separation and reprisals,” of course most people are familiar with the terrible stories of “kids in cages” at US migrant detention camps. The US routinely separates migrant families at its border – and, according to internal documents seen by The Intercept, its federal agents have at least discussed reprisal against pro-immigrant activists.With the issue of “enforced disappearances,” the US government notably runs a camp at Guantanamo Bay on the island of Cuba dedicated to literally just that. It has detained 780 people there since 2002 – and many of them without any formal criminal proceedings. The torture techniques used there have included psychological abuse and threats to harm the families of detainees, which certainly falls under the category of “intimidations, threats and reprisals.”That covers every single accusation in the UN report, showing just how hypocritical Washington would be on this issue if it really decided to open a debate at the UNHRC. We can see that with the most minimal effort, China and other countries could rip Uncle Sam’s moral superiority to shreds.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/563956-us-human-rights-resolution-china/,2022,10,4

Haselma also conceded that she was aware that many Amsterdam residents wouldn’t want the center to be built near their homes.The proposal remains under public consultation in Amsterdam, with a final decision on the location expected in late 2023.

President Joe Biden did not even mention Johnson by name.“The United Kingdom and the United States are the closest of friends and Allies, and the special relationship between our people remains strong and enduring,” said the statement, first published by CBS News.“I look forward to continuing our close cooperation with the government of the United Kingdom, as well as our Allies and partners around the world, on a range of important priorities. That includes maintaining a strong and united approach to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s brutal war on their democracy, and holding Russia accountable for its actions,” said the statement, attributed to Biden. As of 6pm on Thursday, it had not been posted to the White House website.Biden himself told CNN that he had no further comment on Johnson’s resignation, when asked about it following the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony on Thursday afternoon.“No, it’s a part of the process,” said the US leader.: Ukraine saddened by Boris Johnson’s downfall, Zelensky claimsThe New York Post called Biden’s statement a “snub” of Johnson, pointing out that previous US presidents traditionally commented on the resignations of British prime ministers’ with a kind word for them personally.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, by contrast, said all his countrymen were “saddened” by the news of “friend Boris Johnson” resigning as the party leader, while also thanking the UK for its help and support.Johnson led the Tories to a historic election victory in 2019 and successfully took the UK out of the EU.

Possible reason for speedy transmission of monkeypox revealed — RT World News,"        Possible reason for speedy transmission of monkeypox revealed                        Portuguese researchers discovered 50 mutations of the virus which could explain its spread among humans            ©Getty Images                  NurPhoto  ContributorThe monkeypox virus mutates much faster than expected when transmitted among humans, new research suggests, providing a possible explanation for the rapid spread of the disease.In a study published in Nature Medicine on Friday, Portuguese researchers reported the results of “rapid application of high-throughput shotgun metagenomics” as they began reconstructing the first genome sequences of the 2022 ‘version’ of the monkeypox virus.They discovered that the 2022 virus differs from the related 2018-19 viruses by 50 SNP mutations, which are changes that occur in a single nucleotide in the genome. This is roughly six to 12 times more “than one would expect considering previous estimates of the substitution rate for orthopoxviruses (one or two substitutions per site per year).”“Such a divergent branch might represent accelerated evolution,” the researchers claim. They noted, however, that further studies on the matter are needed.“Considering that this 2022 monkeypox virus is likely a descendant of the one in the 2017 Nigeria outbreak, one would expect no more than five to 10 additional mutations instead of the observed about 50 mutations. We hope that now, specialized groups will perform laboratory experiments in order to understand if this 2022 virus has increased its transmissibility,” one of the study’s authors, head of the Genomics & Bioinformatics Unit at the National Institute of Health in Portugal, Joao Paulo Gomes, told Newsweek.: Monkeypox to be rebranded – WHOThe news came as the World Health Organization considers whether the virus outbreak should be classed as a public health emergency of international concern.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of June 23, 3,504 cases of monkeypox have been registered in 44 countries with the biggest number reported in the United Kingdom (793 cases).With the disease spreading predominantly among gay men, the СDС has cautioned doctors not to mistake it for more common sexually transmitted diseases.The WHO is not currently recommending mass vaccination against monkeypox. However, on June 21, the UK Health Security Agency announced that “some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered vaccines to help control the recent outbreak of the virus.”The initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. A rash often begins on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body, although the WHO has noted that patients affected by the current outbreak are developing lesions on the genitals and anus, and not developing some of the traditional flu-like symptoms of infection.The virus can be spread by close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets, as well as via contaminated materials.

Yemen crisis looms over Biden’s Saudi visit — RT World News,"        Yemen crisis looms over Biden’s Saudi visit                        Government report says Washington turned a blind eye to suffering caused by US weapons            People gather after an explosion in the city of Lawdar in Yemen's southern province of Abyan on July 5, 2022. © AFP US President Joe Biden claimed credit for the ceasefire in Yemen in a weekend op-ed defending his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia. He did not comment on the recent report by the government watchdog GAO, which said that the State Department and the Pentagon stopped holding Riyadh accountable for how it used the US-supplied weapons against civilians, a prominent critic pointed out on Monday.Biden had promised to “completely disengage” the US from the Saudi-led war on Yemen, but failed to do so, argued Juan Cole, professor of Middle Eastern and South Asian history at the University of Michigan.The US has provided $54.6 billion in military aid to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since they began bombing Yemen in March 2015, Cole pointed out. US law requires recipients of American military aid to avoid harming civilian non-combatants, but Cole said the Saudi-led coalition has flouted that requirement – and pointed to last month’s report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) showing that the US government did not bother enforcing it, either.The State Department certified in 2018 that the Saudi and Emirati governments “had made efforts to reduce harm to civilians in Yemen, but did not submit two subsequent, required certifications,” said the GAO. Foggy Bottom also “could not provide” evidence that they investigated “incidents of potential unauthorized use of equipment” transferred to Saudi Arabia or the UAE, while the Pentagon “has not reported” any investigations, the watchdog added.: Biden attempts to justify Saudi Arabia tripBiden is headed to Saudi Arabia and Israel later this week. In a Washington Post op-ed on Saturday, he tried to preempt critics by saying he wanted to “reorient – but not rupture – relations” with the Kingdom. Among other things, Biden credited “our persistent diplomacy” with the current truce in Yemen leading, which he said the Saudis fully support.Neither Saudi Arabia nor the Houthi rebels in Yemen credited Washington with the ceasefire that first went into effect at the end of March. It has since been extended through at least early August, though both sides have accused the other of not fully abiding by its terms.In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that US-Saudi relations were at their worst since 1945, citing the Biden administration’s personal criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the 2018 killing of dissident Jamal Khashoggi.Last week, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) released a report on the humanitarian situation in Yemen, with its author Basheer Omar calling it “unimaginable horror.” Two thirds of Yemen’s estimated 30.5 million people lacked access to basic healthcare and more than four million have been displaced by the fighting, the report said.: Yemeni mothers and babies facing ‘unimaginable horror,’ Red Cross tells RTAccording to the UN, Yemen is the “world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” which resulted in over 377,000 deaths by the end of 2021. More than two-thirds of the casualties were under the age of five.While Biden himself used the UN phrasing in his oped, he has not spoken up in support of a bipartisan initiative in Congress to stop further US support to Riyadh – not just in terms of weapons but intelligence and maintenance support – and thereby compel the end to the war.

Now he is performing a 180-degree pivot. With such arbitrary foreign policy positions the US is causing instability and weakening its own hand.On December 13, US Senator Bernie Sanders decided to withdraw a War Powers Resolution on ending US support for Saudi offensive efforts in the war in Yemen. Sanders was supposed to put the resolution to a vote, believing it would have passed. However, owing to pressure mounted against him from the White House, he decided to retreat. Instead, the progressive American senator claimed that he was informed that the Biden administration would “continue working” with his office on ending the conflict.As revealedby The Intercept, which obtained the key talking points distributed by the White House against the resolution, the Biden administration communicated its position that such a resolution would be counterproductive and further exacerbate the crisis in Yemen. However, the ‘Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft’ says that Sanders’ decision to withdraw the resolution “may embolden the many members of Washington’s foreign policy elite who would like to ensure that the president’s capability to unilaterally wage war remains unchallenged by Congress’s constitutional prerogative over matters of war and peace.”The biggest problem here for the US government is that the War Powers Resolution essentially aims to force Biden to implement most of the policies that he himself outlined in February of 2021. Despite Biden having announced that the US was halting all “relevant arms sales” to the Saudi-led coalition – which has been at war with Yemen’s Ansarallah, known commonly as the Houthis, since 2015 – this policy position has never been put into practice.Read moreYemen conflict may flare up again, US warnsDuring his 2020 campaign, Biden claimed that he would make longtime American ally Saudi Arabia a global “pariah.”Yet, when it began to sink in that the powerful oil-producing state was a necessary partner in the Middle East, a realization that came months into the West's sanctions campaign aimed at Russia, the Biden administration quickly decided to change its stance. In July, the president decidedto go on a foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, while in the days prior he entered into discussions about beginning to supply the Saudis with offensive weapons again; the framing of this was a little disingenuous because the weapons sales freeze of February 2021 had effectively been ended by Aprilof the same year anyway. Both of these moves came as a clear attempt to get Saudi Arabia to raise oil-production levels, a goal that failed as the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, refused to pander to the US president.Since then, the US government approveda potential multibillion-dollar deal with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and in August the Biden administration grantedthe Saudi Crown Prince immunity from a civil lawsuit over his role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Biden was reportedly humiliated earlier this year after allegedly bringing up the Khashoggi killing to the Crown Prince, who fired back by citing the Israeli killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, asking why Jamal Khashoggi mattered more. Notably, the US head of state failed a number of times to even pronounce Shireen Abu Akleh’s name correctly when delivering a speech beside Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas just days earlier and did not bring the killing up to Israeli representatives.The White House insinuated, in its opposition to Senator Bernie Sanders’ resolution on Yemen, that it had a hand in the six-month long ceasefirebetween the two primary opposing sides in the war. The reality was that it was the United Nations that brokered the ceasefire, which ended on October 2. In the eyes of Ansarallah, the US government is the primary obstacle to peace in Yemen; Abd al-Wahhab al-Mahbashi, a senior member of Ansarallah, recently warnedthat “the presence of US troops in the Bab al-Mandab and off the coast of Yemen poses a serious threat to maritime navigation.” In fact, Ansarallah views the conflict as a war on behalf of the US, with Saudi Arabia acting as its proxy, a view held by millions in the region.The day following Sanders’ withdrawal of his War Powers Resolution, two fuel shipments, carrying tons of diesel, were seized by the Saudi-led coalition and prevented from reaching Yemen. The blockade of Yemen is one of the major factors contributing to the resurgence of tensions – Ansarallah accuses Riyadh and Abu Dhabi of stealing the nation’s oil resources and depriving native Yemenis. In addition to this, when the US is clearly attempting to cozy up to Saudi Arabia, this signals to the leadership of Ansarallah that the Biden administration is favoring Riyadh in the conflict.Read moreUN brokers extension of Yemen ceasefireThe Biden administration has so far proven ineffective at bringing the Saudis under its wing in the way it had hoped, indicating that its foreign policy tactics have proven ineffective at best. The reason for this failure likely comes down to the way the current government has dealt not only with Saudi Arabia, but with all the states of the Arabian Peninsula in addition to Iran. The US has shown that it cannot be trusted to keep its word, as was proven by its Iran nuclear deal blunder. More importantly, Saudi Arabia understands that, when it comes to security, Washington is not the most important player anymore. Instead of following the Biden administration into a dangerous anti-Iran coalition, the Saudis would be a lot smarter to engage diplomatically with Tehran, a step that would be especially helpful when it comes to regional security.For Washington, meanwhile, an escalation in Yemen at this point would prove advantageous, for it could end up pushing Saudi Arabia closer to it, as the latter needs US help to maintain its war effort, although there is a chance that large-scale ballistic and cruise missile strikes against Saudi Arabia’s vital infrastructure could cause the Kingdom to go straight to the negotiating table. Regardless of how things go, it is clear that US influence in the Arabian Peninsula is rapidly declining and part of its legacy will be this brutal war that has cost upwards of 400,000 lives and that the Biden administration has refused to end.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/568951-biden-war-yemen-saudi/,2022,12,27

Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl was asked about the defunct nuclear deal with Iran while testifying at a House Armed Services Committee hearing about arming Ukraine.“Iran’s nuclear progress since we left the JCPOA has been remarkable,” Kahl said, referring to the 2015 agreement by its acronym. “Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one bomb’s worth of fissile material. Now it would take about 12 days.”According to a “confidential” IAEA report, seen by the Associated Press on Tuesday, inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog had allegedly discovered traces of uranium “particles” enriched up to 83.7% in Iran’s underground Fordo nuclear site. However, they found no signs of Tehran actually stockpiling it – in line with explanations from Iranian officials. Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), previously dismissed a similar report by Bloomberg as “slander and a distortion of the facts.”: Iran reacts to uranium claimWhile US officials and media claim Iran may be on the cusp of producing enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon, the Pentagon reportedly doesn’t believe Tehran has the technology to actually build one.The agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), placed severe restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting the UN sanctions. It was signed by Iran, China, Russia, the US, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the EU. In May 2018, however, US President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement and reimposed sanctions unilaterally. Iran responded by continuing the program, which Tehran has described as entirely peaceful.The Joe Biden administration has attempted to revive the deal, but has been unwilling to lift the sanctions or provide Iran with guarantees it would not violate the agreement again.

Soros compares Ukrainian conflict to siege of Nazi-held city — RT World News,"        Soros compares Ukrainian conflict to siege of Nazi-held city                        The billionaire has appeared to liken the Russian military operation in Ukraine to the 1944 siege of Budapest            © Getty Images  Laszlo Balogh Billionaire investor and major political donor George Soros appeared to inadvertently drew parallels between the Nazis and the modern Ukrainian military in a blog post, in which he compared the current conflict to the 1944 siege of Nazi-held Budapest by the Soviet army.In the post published on his website on Saturday, Soros called on the world to “stand with Ukraine, as they stand with us” before finding apparent similarities between the Russian military action in Ukraine and the the siege of Budapest, then a Nazi-held city, by the Soviet forces.“Brave Ukrainians are now on the frontline and risking their lives in an onslaught that reminds me of the siege of Budapest in 1944 and the siege of Sarajevo in 1993,” the billionaire noted.The message also appeared on Soros’s Twitter account, but was later removed after some of the users pointed to the uncanny parallels. The blog post is still accessible on Soros’ site as of Monday morning.“It is important that both the transatlantic alliance (the United States, Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom) but also other nations do whatever is in their power to support Ukraine in its time of existential threat,” the Open Society Foundations founder wrote, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering “a direct attack on the sovereignty of all States that were once in the Soviet Union, and beyond.”The 1944 siege of Budapest saw the Hungarian city, at the time occupied by the Nazi military, surrounded by Soviet troops for months of grueling house-to-house combat. Soros, then 14, and of Jewish origin, later claimed that he was able to survive the Nazi occupation of his city only because his family managed to obtain Christian IDs.Ordering a “special military operation” in Donbass, Russian President Vladimir Putin described Russia’s mission in the country as one of “de-Nazification” and “demilitarization”. The Ukrainian military is widely reported, including by the western media, to include far-right “volunteers” such as the Azov Battalion, who were seen sporting Nazi regalia on multiple occasions.Read more‘Heroes’: Budapest lauds Hungarians who allied with Nazis to invade USSRFacebook last week reversed its 2019 ban on praise for the far-right paramilitary force which is now embedded with the Ukrainian National Guard. The social media giant, however, said that the battalion would still be banned from posting or recruiting on Facebook.While the Kremlin has accused Kiev of perpetrating genocide against the population of Donbass, Kiev countered that claim, insisting that Russia used it as a false pretext to launch a military offensive. In its appeal to The International Court of Justice on Sunday, Ukraine accused Russia of “planning acts of genocide” against Ukrainians. It fell short of providing any concrete evidence of the alleged war crime.                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/550799-soros-ukraine-nazi-budapest/,2022,2,28
'Her Majesty's Russia Unit': How British spies have launched a full-scale propaganda war to demonize Moscow — RT World News,"        'Her Majesty's Russia Unit': How British spies have launched a full-scale propaganda war to demonize Moscow                        Britain's international information war strategy was developed years ago            ByRT Russian's investigative unit© Getty Images  Jack Taylor The growing political feud between Russia and the West has spurred the activation of specialized propaganda and intelligence units. With regards to the Ukraine crisis, experts say one of the most active parties has been the United Kingdom, which in recent years has stepped up its efforts todemonizeRussia by waging a full-scale propaganda war.As an RT analysis has shown, Britain’s 'HMG Russia Unit,' an interdepartmental government organization created several years ago, has acted as a front for soft influence operations against Moscow with the assistance of international consulting organizations.Up until now, the activities of the operation had not been publicly visible. However,last monthpublications containing its employees’ personal information appeared in a number of Russian Telegram channels. It is alleged that the email addresses included in these posts belong to employees of the HMG Russia Unit who are also connected to various other UK government departments, including the Cabinet Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, military intelligence, MI5, and the Ministry of Defence, as well as American curators attached to the group.Prioritized propagandaTo begin with, let’s explain how a group specifically targeting Russia appeared within the British government, what its purpose is, and what it does.Read moreUK targets Russian stock market“The government has long recognized the presence of a sustained and significant threat from Russia to the UK and its allies, including both conventional military capabilities and disinformation, illegal financial transactions, influence operations, and cyber-attacks,” said a report submitted to parliament by the Office of the British Prime Minister in 2020.For the British government, Russia has become “one of the main priorities from the point of view of national security,” it adds.“This is why in 2017 the Government implemented the NSC-endorsed (National Security Council — RT) Russia Strategy, and in 2017 established the cross-Government Russia Unit which brings together the UK’s diplomatic, intelligence and military capabilities to maximum effect,” the report goes on to say.According to the British government’s own reports, the HMG Russia Unit, which was formally attached to the UK Foreign Office, was primarily tasked with coordinating information and propaganda campaigns aimed against Russia. This can be traced from data released by the British government and, in particular, from a large-scale program financed by the UK Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) that was carried out by the Foreign Office up until 2021 to develop media resources, including in Russian, and so-called ""counter disinformation.""The program notes that the United Kingdom is working with a number of partners to improve the quality of public and independent media resources, including Russian-speaking ones, so they can “support social cohesion, uphold universal values and provide communities in countries across Eastern Europe with access to reliable information.”The forms of support vary. They include, for example, mentoring by British media staff, consultations on creating broadcast networks, financing of joint productions, and support for regional media projects in Russian.“In the coming year we will be investing over £8m in supporting public service and independent media. This will include projects in the Baltic States and Ukraine, as well as regional initiatives,” according to a document published by the UK government.Contract for demonizationHowever, the HMG Russia Unit’s efforts are not limited to coordinating propaganda efforts. From data on the UK government’s public procurement portal, it can be seen that it has served as a customer for the Green Finance initiative – a British-Russian project aimed at promoting sustainable financing for developing institutional ties between Moscow and London in the environmental and economic spheres. The final date for fulfilling the contract is March 31, 2022.Funds in the amount of £987,600 were received by the well-known consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).If we analyze the UK government’s funding allocations targeting Russia, it turns out that in addition to PwC, Moody’s Analytics (a Moody’s subsidiary) received funds through a specialized non-profit entity named UK Research and Innovation as part of a contract to track companies and individuals that have been sanctioned over the Ukraine conflict. The relevant restrictions are noted on a portal for the placement of UK government contracts.Read moreEU calls for confiscation of frozen Russian assetsThe involvement of private international consulting companies in promoting the UK agenda with respect to Russia, as well as the post-Soviet space, logically correlates with the HMG Russia Unit’s involvement in large-scale projects to demonize Russia’s image.In this regard, there is a noteworthy letter dated February 7, 2019, addressed to the British investigative journalist Till Bruckner, who had requested data on the activities of the Integrity Initiative from the British Foreign Office. It states that in 2017-2018, £296,500 was earmarked to finance the project, and an additional £1.961 million in 2019.A response to the journalist’s request was received from the HMG Russia Unit. The Integrity Initiative has been flagged as one of Britain’s main programs responsible for spreading anti-Russia fakes and waging a propaganda war against Moscow. At the same time, as RT noted back in 2018,the hacker collectiveAnonymouspublished internal documents from the Integrity Initiative that revealed the mechanisms British media networks employ in their subversive work aimed at Russia.‘Fake’ trendsettersBritish influence networks initially set a certain standard for the West’s anti-Russian template, Alexey Martynov, a political scientist who heads the Institute of Newly Established States, said in an interview with RT.“The British are trendsetters, in a sense. The now popular buzzword ‘fake news’, the formation of false narratives, the management of media streams – all this was born in their heads,” says the political scientist. “Goebbels studied with British military propagandists. What they are doing is military propaganda.”The academic noted that using private consulting companies and rating agencies as tools to influence Russia was a ‘soft power’ tactic traditionally employed by specialized British agencies.“Any rating agency is created as a tool for manipulating media flows, and other business dimensions grow out of this. They also have access to domestic statistics that are not available to the public,” the political scientist said. “These mechanisms have been tested since the 1990s, when all data was opened to foreign ‘partners’. Then these mechanisms were created – it is important to have a high ranking with rating agencies, otherwise you won’t receive loans.”The UK continues to ramp up its sanctions against Russia. In May, it announced another package of restrictive measures, adding more individuals and legal entities from Russia to the list and planning to ban imports of Russian oil. In April, London also banned the import of Russian silver, caviar, and wood products.ANALYSIS                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/555064-london-consulting-companies-against-moscow/,2022,5,6

With Russian ships now banned from British ports, and British airspace off limits to Russian flights, it is likely that most of these imports will grind to a halt.In recent days, the UK has also sanctioned Russian banks, including the country’s central bank, and backed Russia’s expulsion from the SWIFT banking network. Meanwhile, London has shipped anti-tank missiles and other “lethal aid” to Ukraine.Speaking in Parliament on Monday, UK Home Secretary Liz Truss said that the British government wants ""a situation where they [Russia] can't access their funds, their trade can't flow, their ships can't dock and their planes can't land.”Russia has banned British flights from its airspace, and may nationalize the property of foreigners in Russia, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated on Saturday.

UK candidates’ militancy and imperialism threaten to bring Britain down — RT World News,"        UK candidates’ militancy and imperialism threaten to bring Britain down                        Confronting Russia and China has become the main talking point as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss try to ‘out-hawk’ each other            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystConservative leadership candidates Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss during Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate at Riverside Studios on July 17, 2022 in London, England. © Jonathan Hordle  ITV via Getty Images During the upcoming televised debate, British Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Boris Johnson’s government, is expectedto promise resolute action against China, which he accuses of “being the biggest long-term threat to the UK.”Claiming that Beijing is now “infiltrating our universities” and “stealing our technology,” racist scaremongering talking points which originated from the Trump administration, Sunak will call for strengthening NATO cooperation against China and will pledge to close all 30 Confucius institutes in the country (which teach Chinese language but have been frequently and baselessly accused of espionage and political interference).To most Tory hawks, however, Sunak’s rhetoric isn’t convincing. Only as recently as January did he in fact vow to deepen business ties between China and the UK. His change of course is blatantly motivated by his desire to become the leader of the party and pander to a right-wing populist base who overwhelmingly favour his opponent Liz Truss, who models herself quite explicitly after Margaret Thatcher. As the first ever ethnic minority candidate for Conservative leadership, it isn’t rocket science to see why he is at a disadvantage in such circumstances, a sad but uncomfortable truth.Read moreLiz Truss warns the world of evil womenWith Sunak’s previous positions on China also being fairly reasonable, this has also quickly turned into a line of attack against him by the right-wing press, with the Daily Mail recently claiming he was supported by China’s Global Times, which, it said, was “the endorsement nobody wanted.”However, nobody would seriously think that Sunak is going to ‘out-hawk’ Truss, who has been fanatical in her confrontational approach to diplomacy against both China and Russia, and her zealous obsession with democracy – or rather, the rhetoric construct of “democracy” so often used as a rallying cry by Western leaders.For Britain as a whole, this is disastrous news, but few people will be realizing it. Despite talk of “global Britain” and “free trade,” whoever should succeed Boris Johnson (and it will probably be Truss) will put Britain on a collision course with the world’s second-largest economy, the largest in terms of imports and exports, despite the lingering impacts of Brexit, and of course whilst simultaneously pursuing an aggressive proxy war in Ukraine, where Truss wants nothing less than the defeat of the Russian state. One might pause and ask, what on Earth has gone wrong with British foreign policy? In light of all this, and of Brexit, how could it have become so unhinged and self-defeating? It is demonstrative of the sheer madness which has captured the political mainstream in the light of Brexit.Modern Britain has always, at every point in history, been arrogant and aggressive, completely unrepentant of its imperial legacy. Attributing Brexit as the starting point of such unbridled chauvinism might lead one to forget about the destruction of Iraq, Libya and Syria, and of course Britain’s continuing toadyism to American foreign-policy preferences and clear lack of independence in its own direction. After all, the United Kingdom has on paper participated in every single US-led war after World War II. The sole exception was Vietnam, thanks to Harold Wilson, a Labour Prime Minister who truly defined the “swinging sixties” in Britain and refused to assist. But he was the exception.Read moreThree candidates remain in race to replace JohnsonThus, whilst it was always there, Brexit has manifested itself as probably the highest and most chauvinistic form of Anglophone exceptionalism and ideological elitism yet, specifically because it has suffocated the post-war debate concerning Britain’s post-imperial identity and the bid to be part of Europe. Instead of moving on from the past, it has doubled down on it, and in turn has merged with a brand of extreme neoconservatism to become even more subservient to the United States and wage hyper-aggression against certain countries, in this case Russia and China, in the name of British civilisation. Any pragmatism, any reason, balance and humility that might have otherwise restrained Conservative politicians has evaporated in the name of populism.Now we’re at the stage where an Indian-origin British politician feels he can solicit political gain for himself by weaponizing fear, hate and scaremongering against Chinese people, betraying the diverse and open country where his parents settled and which allowed him to become so successful. It is a sorry state of affairs, and this aggressive pursuit of burning bridges and geopolitical confrontation will undoubtedly, as it has already, place further strain on the British economy, already beset by surging inflation, shrinking incomes, growing industrial unrest and eye-watering inequality. While of course, Liz Truss looks to be an almost inevitable victor, the fact someone like her is in this position speaks volumes about not her ascent, but about Britain’s descent. If you thought Boris Johnson was bad (he was personally incompetent but politically restrained by the standards of others), things are about to get a whole lot worse. On multiple fronts, we’re going to see the UK now take the deep turn of right-wing regression the US has been experiencing.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/559592-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-candidates/,2022,7,25
Israeli military drone maker hacked — RT World News,"        Israeli military drone maker hacked                        An “unknown actor” was behind the data breach, according to a US-based branch of Israel’s Elbit Systems            FILE PHOTO: The Elbit Systems Hermes 900 Kochav (""Star"") UAV ©                Elbit SystemsAn Israeli arms contractor specializing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has fallen victim to a hack that impacted nearly 400 employees, the company said, noting that sensitive personal data was likely stolen from its US branch, Elbit America.The firm announced the cyber attack in a notification to authorities in Maine earlier this month, as was first reported by TechCrunch on Monday, revealing that 369 staffers were swept up in a hack that occurred in June.“On June 8, 2022, someone attempted to interfere with Elbit America’s cyber operations. We immediately shut down our network and took steps to secure our environment,” the company said in a letter to those potentially affected by the breach.After hiring a “leading cybersecurity firm” to investigate, Elbit said it determined that “an unknown actor gained access to and obtained certain data” from its network, including “individuals’ names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, direct deposit information, and ethnicity.”The company offered few other details about the cyber intrusion, but said it did not believe any personal information had been “misused as a result of this incident.”: Israel sells air defense system to Arab country – mediaThe Texas-based subsidiary did not name any actors believed to have carried out the hack, though cybersecurity blogger Eduard Kovacs observed that a ransomware gang known as ‘Black Basta’ boasted of an attack on Elbit Systems in late June, not long after the company says it was breached. The group reportedly posted a handful of stolen documents on its website at the time, including payroll information and a non-disclosure agreement.Headquartered in Haifa, Israel, Elbit’s main business primarily offers drone technology, though it has also dabbled in the surveillance industry through a number of acquisitions. According to an investigation by researchers at Citizen Lab, an Elbit subsidiary known as Cyberbit produced spyware used to surveil Ethiopian dissidents in the US, the UK and elsewhere for some time starting in 2016. Elbit later sold most of its shares in Cyberbit and became a minority stakeholder by 2020.: Iran provides details on new suicide droneElbit has come under fire from human rights organizations not only for the Cyberbit controversy, but for its broader role in supplying the Israeli military with attack, reconnaissance and spy drones. In July, activists targeted a factory producing UAV engines for Elbit based in Shenstone, Britain, claiming to inflict thousands of dollars in damage to the facility in retaliation for lethal Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank. In addition to Israel’s own armed forces, Elbit has sold drone tech to a long list of countries, including the United States, Azerbaijan, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Colombia, Georgia and the Philippines, among others.

Everything works. It is the best combination of political freedom, economic prosperity and social cohesion that the humankind has been able to build – the three things together.”But, warned Borrell ominously, “The rest of the world is not exactly a garden. Most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden.”How then was this unwelcome prospect to be avoided?The solution was simple, according to Borrell – EU ambassadors, who he designated as “gardeners,” had to “go to the jungle” and impose on it the ideological, political, and economic agendas of the globalised West.The “garden” could not sit by idly and do nothing, cautioned Borrell. “A nice small garden surrounded by high walls in order to prevent the jungle from coming in is not going to be a solution. Because the jungle has a strong growth capacity, the wall will never be high enough in order to protect the garden,” Borrell explained.“Europeans have to be much more engaged with the rest of the world otherwise the rest of the world will invade us by different ways and means,” Borrell advised.Borrell’s speech was immediately criticised by a few left-wing politicians in Europe, as well as some non-European states, most notably the UAE, on the grounds that it was “racist” and “rooted in colonialism.”Those criticisms are valid as far as they go, and Borrell grudgingly offered an apology of sorts – saying “I am sorry if some have felt offended.” Nevertheless, he stood by his basic metaphor, reiterating that “Regrettably, the world in which we live today looks more and more like a ‘jungle’ and less and less like a ‘garden’.”Read moreEU's top diplomat apologizes for ‘jungle’ remarksBut much more serious criticisms can be legitimately levelled at Borrell’s crass worldview – censures that go well beyond the obvious fact that it simply reeks of nineteenth century Euro-centric prejudices.First, let us start with Borrell’s extraordinary Pollyanna-like assertion that in Europe and the West “everything works” and that the “garden” nations are havens of political, economic, and social stability.This pronouncement will no doubt have come as a surprise to many citizens in Europe and the West.Has Borrell not noticed the recent rise of powerful right-wing political movements in a number of European countries? Is he not aware of the recent election results in Italy and Sweden?Have Borrell’s advisors not informed him of the political instability that has engulfed the United Kingdom in recent months, let alone the crisis in democracy that has crippled the United States for the past two years?Has Borrell not noticed the dramatic recent rise in energy prices; rising inflation; rising interest rates; long-term wage stagnation; and the looming economic recession that is predicted to engulf many Western nations in the near future? Has Borrell not seen the tens of thousands of demonstrators marching in European capital cities in recent months? Is he unaware of the effects that EU austerity programs have had in many of the bloc’s member nations in recent years?Does Borrell really believe that the “garden” nations will sail through the upcoming European winter unscathed?Has Borrell never heard of the so-called ‘culture wars’? Has he not noticed the collapse of liberal institutions and values throughout the West in recent decades? Has the immigration crisis that has bedevilled Europe in recent years, and has recently engulfed the United Kingdom, not yet been brought to his attention?Borrell, of course, pointedly fails to mention that all of the problems listed above have been severely exacerbated by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.In fact, Borrell does not seem to appreciate that the increasing political and economic instability within the “garden” nations makes it increasingly difficult – if not impossible – for them to pursue his misguided foreign policy agenda.Obviously, the view from Bruges differs from that from, say, Athens.Second, let us examine Borrell’s prescription for exporting Western “stability” to the “jungle” states that languish threateningly outside the gates of the EU Garden of Eden.Borrell’s solution is deceptively simple: just let the EU “gardeners” impose Western hegemony on those unstable “jungle” nations – with, it almost goes without saying, the helpful assistance of the United States.Readers will not be surprised to learn that Borrell is a keen supporter of the United States. Last year he stated “One thing is clear: close EU-US cooperation based on shared values is key for international peace, security and prosperity.”Even if his Bruges speech did not explicitly include the US in his imaginary ""garden"", he obviously does not think of it as part of""the rest of the world"".Read moreIn the battle for the ‘Global South’, an ancient evil rears its headBorrell apparently has failed to notice that the US has spent the last few decades attempting to implement his foreign policy program in spades – for example, in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. He seems unaware that these previous attempts to tame the “jungle” ended in chaos. Nor, of course, does he acknowledge that many of the problems that plague the “jungle” nations today were, in fact, caused by such misconceived interventions.Borrell’s entire worldview is nothing more than a global elite fantasy – designed, in part, to camouflage the unpalatable fact that the Western “garden” nations are, in fact, becoming more and more like the non-Western “jungle” countries that he despises and fears.Isn’t the political, economic and social instability that today afflicts almost all Western nations – in large part caused by the West’s mistaken foreign policy excursions – precisely the same instability that has beset some non-Western nations for decades? And, hasn’t this instability intensified dramatically in the West in recent years?Test that proposition by way of a comparison relating to political stability.Brazil has experienced chronic political instability for decades. Prior to the recent presidential election, President Jair Bolsonaro announced that he would not accept the election result if he lost.In the United States, former President Trump refused to accept his election defeat in 2020, culminating in the January 6 capitol riots. Trump and dozens of candidates endorsed by him have since maintained their position that Joe Biden’s 2020 victory was illegitimate.Bolsonaro narrowly lost the recent presidential election in Brazil – but, after his defeat, he did accept the result, even if his supporters staged mass protests in the streets.Trump and many of his candidates are now refusing to accept the results of the US mid-term elections – let alone the 2020 result – and Trump intends to run again for president in 2024.Looking at the two countries’ relative political stability, where does one put the ""garden"" fence?Just this week two important events highlighted just how divorced from reality Borrell’s worldview actually is.Read morePeople care more about living standards than climate –EU leaderFirst, at the COP27 conference in Egypt, the “jungle” asserted its autonomy by demanding payment of billions of dollars in “reparations” for the damage done to its countries by climate change.This demand lies completely outside Borrell’s crude frame of reference, and, perhaps more disturbingly, seems completely justified by the EU’s own catastrophic climate change ideology. I suspect that the EU “gardeners” will find any such reparations a tough sell to EU citizens who cannot pay their energy bills this winter.Second, it now appears that the Biden administration is placing increasing pressure on Vladimir Zelensky to negotiate a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine – and that this pressure will intensify once the Republicans take control of the US House of Representatives. Where this leaves a fervent and uncritical supporter of the conflict like Borrell – or Zelensky for that matter – is not yet clear.Borrell is nothing more than a rather unsophisticated representative of the global elites that have blindly and rapaciously presided over the decline of European and Western political and economic stability in recent decades.That being so, it is perfectly apt that he should find himself in charge of EU foreign policy and security at the present time – because, as Cyril Connolly once famously prophesied, it now appears that “it is closing time in the gardens of the West.”The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/566364-borrell-garden-jungle-racist/,2022,11,13

On Tuesday, a former member of West Mercia Police was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison for sharing memes mocking the death of George Floyd.The memes, which were shared in a private WhatsApp group with his friends, included pictures depicting George Floyd’s death, such as one featuring him as George of the Jungle, and another with a Muslim kneeling on him where a prayer mat ought to be, according to Sky News.Former constable James Watts, who pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sending a grossly offensive or menacing message by public communication network, was initially ordered to pay measly compensation of £75 to the complainant, alongside a victim surcharge and a small court fee. However, the presiding judge, Tanveer Ikram, took it upon himself to make an example of Watts.In delivering the 20-week prison sentence, Ikram declared that the former police officer “undermined confidence the public has in the police,” and that his behavior brought the organization into disrepute.Read moreGeorge Floyd’s murderer dodges death penaltyIt’s enough time for anyone to think things over – but perhaps not in the way that Ikram might expect. Rather than be apologetic, one might instead be obstinate and defiant in the face of such injustice. After all, it is not the judge’s job to make an example of anyone. His job is merely to uphold and carry out the law.The bottom line here is that a police officer, or really, just a member of the public, has been handed a lengthy prison sentence for a joke. Or 10 memes, in Watts’ instance.Watts didn’t share his jokes on a public platform – he did so in the privacy of a closed WhatsApp group. There was little expectation that anyone outside the group would be aware of the jokes, much less be impacted by them. It’d be a whole different story if Watts used a Twitter account to harass supporters of George Floyd online. There was an expectation of privacy when he shared his memes.The magistrate’s claim that Watts violated Britain’s Communications Decency Act of 2003 sets a worrying precedent that all future jokes, told in private or otherwise, could conceivably be treated as imprisonable offenses – even if they’re among friends and family.Watts displayed a gross lack of professionalism, because a man who treats people differently on the basis of race cannot be expected to enforce the law fairly – and it rightly cost him the ability to work in any policing role for life. He also exposed himself as a racist, but being a racist per se is not a crime that should be punishable by jail time.Read moreTwo cops cleared of Black Lives Matter attack chargesBritain has a long and colorful history of telling jokes – especially dark ones.

Had Boyle made the same jokes as former PC Watts, he would’ve been let off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, just as he’s gotten away for years by joking about Madeleine McCann and other murdered and abducted children.Watts was an easy target for the courts. Without any celebrity behind his name, the police officer was made an example of by a judge seeking to send a message to the masses.Over the past couple of decades, Britain has seen a slow erosion of its previously classical liberal values. It’s no longer the bastion of free speech it once was. Even as it seeks to lecture other countries on democracy and liberalism, freedom for British citizens has become tenuous at best.In Scotland, YouTuber and comedian Mark Meechan was convicted for making a joke about Nazis with his girlfriend’s pet pug. Some particularly sensitive individuals complained to the police, and Meechan was arrested and forced to cough up a fine over the clear misunderstanding. The court dismissed his defense that it was just a joke intended for his girlfriend, on the grounds that she was not subscribed to his channel.Former Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf, who still remains in the SNP’s cabinet, introduced the Hate Crime Bill in 2018, which was the boldest (or really, worst) effort yet to police speech in Scottish households. Yousaf insisted that existing laws, which allow people to use, in the privacy of their homes, language that is deemed illegal in public, be repealed and that such conversations held over the dinner table “must be prosecuted.”Read moreGRAPHIC VIDEO shows officers pushing protester, knocking him UNCONSCIOUS, then claim he ‘tripped’Similar efforts are being made by the Trudeau government in Canada to combat so-called hate speech through amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, which propose defining the communication of hate speech on the internet.Just as it’s being applied in the United Kingdom, Canada’s speech laws define “hate speech” as any content that vilifies or detests an individual or group on the basis of a protected ground of discrimination, including race, disability, gender, sexual identity, and so on. In other words, you could go to jail over any careless word about George Floyd once the law passes.Britain, Canada, and perhaps the Western world as a whole, are spiraling into an Orwellian nightmare as so-called “liberal” governments and their allies in Big Tech move to stamp out freedom of speech under the guise of fighting against “hate speech” and “disinformation” – vague terms that can be used to justify prosecutions of anyone opposed to the establishment.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/557349-jail-uk-george-floyd/,2022,6,20

The vote passedwith 598 in favor to nine votes against, with 31 abstentions, in what is a non-binding amendment, meaning that the EU does not have to act on it, but will likely have to deal with mounting pressure to do so.The stated reason for the damning designation is the Guard Corps’ alleged“terrorist activity, the repression of protesters and its supplying of drones to Russia.” The UK is also preparing to proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist group, with broadly the same justifications. However, one of London’s key reasons for resolving to do so has clearly been connected to Iran’s execution of its former deputy defense minister Alireza Akbari, who was convicted of spying for Britain’s intelligence agency, MI6. The UK government, in itsofficial condemnations of the death sentence handed to Akbari, undermined the professionalism of Iran’s judiciary and omitted his conviction in an apparent attempt to frame him as a political martyr. London has also introduced 30 new sanctions against Tehran as a response.The first problem with designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization, if the UK and the EU end up doing so, is that they will be applying the terrorist label to an official wing of the Iranian state’s armed forces. This would also include the Quds Force, which deals with foreign military and intelligence ventures, in addition to the volunteer paramilitary force known as the Basij. One of the reasons why the designation of a country’s armed forces as a terrorist group is so problematic is because it then opens up the floor to counter-measures from enemy states.Read moreIran threatens to designate all EU member armies as terroristsThis weakens the very term ‘terrorism’ as a hyperpolarized tool with which to batter an enemy. This tool is then significantly devalued in its originally intended use – to designate actual terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS) or Al-Qaeda as common international threats.Although the United Nations has no clear definition of terrorism, leaving this matter up to individual states to decide, it does routinely express concern over how certain definitions can impact human rights. The EU and UK’s definitions are very vague, yet share common themes in that they focus on non-state actors, which is an unspoken rule when it comes to defining what a terrorist group is. A terrorist organization, like Al-Qaeda or IS, cannot be accepted as a state for this reason, even if they manage to set up a state-like structure. At this moment, sanctions on the Taliban are still in place in Afghanistan, and at the United Nations the Taliban’s proposed representative has not been permitted to represent Kabul’s Islamic Emirate.The Islamic Republic of Iran is, however, a longstanding member state of the United Nations, as a state it also has certain rights and characteristics. Under former US President Donald Trump the IRGC was designated as a terrorist organization by the US government, yet the legality of this has come into question, along with Washington’s maximum-pressure sanctions campaign that has been condemned by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Iran, as well as Iraq, have both issued arrest warrants for Donald Trump and a number of others who participated in the extrajudicial assassination of Iran’s highest-ranking General, Qassem Soleimani. General Soleimani was killed without any legal precedence, after having helped build the ground force that helped defeat the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.The EU and UK, in joining their US ally and defining the IRGC as a terrorist organization, would also go a step further than the West did during the Cold War, with their politicized slander of the Soviet Union. In the 1980’s the idea in the West emerged that Moscow was engaged in a form of state terrorism, whereby the USSR supported a worldwide network that was aimed at destabilizing Western democracies; this ‘terror network theory’ was popularized after having captured the imaginations of figures within the Reagan administration. Never did the West take the step, however, of designating the Soviet military as a terrorist organization.Interestingly, the primary focus since September 11, 2001, in the post-Cold War setting, has been combating international Islamic fundamentalist militant groups, as opposed to secular groups during the Cold War. The well-known policy position held under the UK’s former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was that “we do not negotiate with terrorists,” a position that came about during Britain’s conflict with the IRA. Interestingly enough, Margaret Thatcher’s government openly backed the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, against its then-communist government. They would later go on to form both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda – two groups two which George W Bush Jr and Tony Blair would then apply the policy of not talking to terrorists during the so-called “war on terror.”Read moreIran warns EU against ‘shooting itself in the foot’The problem now is that as the world heads into the territory of a second Cold War, a reality that is further developing by the day, the grounds are being laid for an even more extreme partisan take on serious issues like terrorism. The term ‘terrorism’ has always been politicized, but attaching it to the armed forces of internationally recognised states creates a new problem for any international coordination on fighting groups like Al-Qaeda.This issue of who is and isn’t a terrorist has been developing for some time, with most debate recently focusing on the different political and military factions of the Palestinians. Western governments support the idea that a two-State solution must be reached to end the Palestine-Israel conflict, which should result in the formation of two democratic states side-by-side. However the EU, the UK and the US all consider every single Palestinian political party other than the mainstream branch of Fatah to be a terrorist organization, meaning that there can be no democratic outcome other than what the West desires, which puts a ‘soft lock’ on actual democracy.In addition to this, designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization will have the effect opposite to its ostensible goals. It will make the Middle East less stable, not more so, and will also fail to punish Iran in any substantive way. Even with the imposition of new sanctions by the West, adding to the US-led maximum-pressure campaign, Tehran has been able to increase its oil and gas exports to a record high since the sanctions began. The West would be better off engaging with Tehran to come to an agreement and settle their differences, a step that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is currently attempting to take in a more mature manner than its Western allies. If the UK and the EU do go through with this decision, they should understand that everything they accuse Iran of doing can be pointed out about them also, except the West’s covert backing of what can be described as terrorist groups exceeds anything Iran does.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/570465-iran-labeling-irgc-terrorism/,2023,1,30
WHO issues fresh warning over monkeypox — RT World News,"        WHO issues fresh warning over monkeypox                        “No room for complacency” as infections triple in just two weeks            A bucket with suspected monkeypox samples at the microbiology laboratory of La Paz Hospital, June 22, 2022, Madrid, Spain.  ©Getty Images                  Pablo Blazquez Dominguez  StringerMonkeypox cases have tripled in Europe over the past two weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed on Friday, warning that “urgent and coordinated action” is required.According to the WHO’s regional director for Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, monkeypox cases have been reported in six new countries and areas since mid-June, taking the total to 31. During the same period, the number of new cases in the region has tripled to 4,500.The International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee will soon revise its evaluation of the outbreak’s significance, Kluge revealed. The current position of the committee is that the outbreak “does not constitute a public health emergency of international concern.”“There is simply no room for complacency – especially right here in the European region with its fast-moving outbreak that with every hour, day and week is extending its reach into previously unaffected areas,” the regional director said.Kluge outlined a set of measures that should be taken by governments to address the issue. First of all, he said, “countries must quickly scale up surveillance for monkeypox, including sequencing, and obtain the capacity to diagnose and respond to the disease.” The WHO official also stressed the need for “sound public health investments,” as well as transparency in policies, and communication of the “right messages” for the public.: WHO issues monkeypox threat reportMeanwhile, Kluge said the “sitgmatization” of gay people is threatening the fight against the disease, as 99% of cases have occurred in male patients – the majority of whom are known to have had sex with other men.“We know from our lessons in dealing with HIV how stigma further fuels outbreaks and epidemics, but allowing our fear of creating stigma to prevent us from acting may be just as damaging,” he said.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of July 1, 5,783 cases of monkeypox have been registered in 52 countries with the biggest number reported in the United Kingdom (1,235 cases).The WHO is not currently recommending mass vaccination against monkeypox. However, on June 28, the US government announced that nearly two million monkeypox vaccines would be distributed in the coming months among “individuals at high risk.”On June 21, the UK Health Security Agency announced that “some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered vaccines to help control the recent outbreak of the virus.”The initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. A rash often begins on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body, although the WHO has noted that patients affected by the current outbreak are developing lesions on the genitals and anus, and not developing some of the traditional flu-like symptoms of infection.The virus can be spread through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets, as well as via contaminated materials.

China, however, is moving in without attendant criticisms that are – while mostly valid – more often than not fraught with boldfaced hypocrisy, given the West’s proclivity for unilateral wars of aggression and trampling on its domestic population’s civil liberties.In fact, China’s policy of strict non-interference in the affairs of other countries has materialized in the Middle East with remarkable success. While Washington has stoked sectarian disagreements between Sunni and Shia Muslims by drawing the Gulf States and Iran into proxy conflicts, Beijing has pursued fruitful economic cooperation with both sides without protests from either side. China actually penned a historic, 25-year agreement with Saudi Arabia’s regional adversary, Iran, earlier this year that will include partnerships in many fields, including trade, economics, and transportation.China also early this year presented a five-point security initiative on achieving security and stability in the Middle East. The points of this initiative are advocating mutual respect; upholding equity and justice; achieving nuclear non-proliferation; jointly fostering collective security; and accelerating development cooperation, as stated by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. This has been warmly greeted by countries in the region and is a model for how China wants to foster security cooperation without launching unilateral wars under false pretenses, as the United States did in Iraq.Read moreChina and Gulf countries deepen tiesBut Xi’s visit was mostly focused on economic cooperation. Saudi Arabia has drawn the ire of Washington in recent months after voting in favor of cutting oil production in October in the OPEC+ format despite calls from US President Joe Biden to boost production in order to bring fuel prices down, no doubt to help his party’s odds in last month’s midterm elections. Since then, Riyadh has shown its lack of desire to be pinned by the West and is diversifying its relations by turning eastward.In steps China. As a signatory of the Beijing-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and a key hub in linking Asia, Europe, and Africa, Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to benefit from development cooperation with China, which has been eager to invest in tangible assets and boost win-win cooperation with countries in the Global South seeking economic development.At the same time, the conditions are already there for the two sides to boost their cooperation, given that Riyadh is China’s largest trading partner among Arab countries and China has been Saudi Arabia’s biggest trade locale since 2013. In particular, China is a massive importer of raw materials from all over the world, which it uses to power its vast manufacturing base –and Saudi oil is no exception. With that being said, the two are also closely aligned in their Green development initiatives, which, for the Saudi side, is detailed in the Kingdom’s ‘Vision 2030’.According to media reports, agreements worth a hearty $29 billion are expected to be signed by the two sides during Xi’s visit. These include more than 20 initiatives and a strategic partnership agreement that will harmonize the aforementioned Vision 2030 with the BRI. The two countries will, after the outcome of this visit, thus more firmly align their long-term strategic outlooks to complement one another and will lead to more win-win cooperation for both sides.Read moreChina wants to drop dollar in oil trade – ReutersWhile Washington is seeing its relations with the Kingdom fall out in recent days despite Saudi Arabia being an ally of the United States for several decades, China is seeing a massive boost to its diplomatic capital in the Middle East. That is precisely because Beijing does not make political demands of its allies that directly contradict their basic self-interest, as the US has attempted to do by pulling Riyadh into its proxy conflict against Russia in Ukraine via unilateral sanctions and other means.That is to say that China’s strict non-interference policy is its greatest leverage in butting the US out of the Middle East. Countries in the region know all too well the destruction that follows Washington’s agenda; They have seen their sister countries maimed and destroyed by American foreign policy and many have had to house the refugees produced by these conflicts. But Beijing offers a different brand of partnership, namely one that is not dependent on one-sided political dealings or sectarian hatred –but on simple self-interest.The greatest mark of China’s success in the Middle East compared to Washington is the fact that it can maintain strategic partnerships with countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran that have been rife with sectarian disputes for decades. That is something that the West has not only never been able to achieve but has only ever capitalized on to suit its own political objectives in the region through divide-and-conquer tactics.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/567971-xi-saudi-arabia-china/,2022,12,12

It shapes the culture that sees black people as less, treats black lives as disposable, and ensures that black lives don’t matter.”As host Kay Burley began to point out that the officers charged with Nichols’ murder were black, Mos-Shogbamimu said, “I’m about to educate some people right now.” She likened the Nichols incident to the May 2020 death of George Floyd, which sparked violent Black Lives Matters protests across the US and Europe.Representation and diversity matters, but don't bring in ""black and brown gatekeepers"" who represent white supremacy and call that representation, says @SholaMos1 when asked about the Tyre Nichols killinghttps:t.copIDZkPXLkr📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube pic.twitter.comJS3TeNVeCF— Sky News (@SkyNews) January 30, 2023After Burley noted that Nichols’ mother said she hoped her son’s death would lead to change, the activist said, “Between George Floyd and today, nothing has changed.

Liz Truss’ term was a disaster but she is just a symptom of deeper problems — RT World News,"        Liz Truss’ term was a disaster but she is just a symptom of deeper problems                        The outgoing UK premier was brought to power by a chaotic political climate that was caused by issues festering for over a decade            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystLiz Truss. ©                Dominic LipinskiPA Images via Getty ImagesLiz Truss could go down in history as the single worst British Prime Minister of all time. It is very difficult to top the legacy of being in office a mere 45 days and then being forced out after a U-turn on a disastrous ‘Mini-Budget,’ having sacked your chancellor of the exchequer for your mistake.The Conservative Party has a notorious reputation for pulling out the knives on their leaders – just look at Truss’ idol, Margaret Thatcher. But she lasted 11 years, not a month and a half. This situation is, even by the Tory standards, unprecedented.That’s of course because everyone who said Liz Truss was unsuitable and unqualified to be Prime Minister was right. But that begs the question: how exactly did she get there? And how is it that British politics has descended into a farce that has allowed this to happen?Liz Truss is the embodiment of a trend in British politics wherein nationalism, populism and ideology have displaced rational decision-making in government, creating instability and chaos. It is a product of Brexit, which aggressively reformed the political landscape of Britain and the balance of factional power in the Conservative Party.Read moreUK PM steps down after 6 weeks in powerBritish politics is unstable. It is divided, it is chaotic, and only in a climate like this could someone like Truss possibly have come to office. Her entire political career and her rapid ascension to power is a product not of her being “capable” but of having mastered the art of blasting talking points and slogans matching the political climate of her time.She never had any serious policies. Everything was based on a fantasy blend of ultra-neoliberal economics, nationalism, and geopolitical crusading. From a “network of liberty,” to fanatical assertions of great power dreams. Everyone knew it was a disaster waiting to happen.Yet, her rhetorical instincts were favoured by Boris Johnson, who sought to make her the ‘face’ of the Brexit agenda and the spokesperson of ‘Global Britain,’ and not surprisingly by the right-wing membership of the Conservative Party, who swiftly put her into office.But when it came to the crunch, she quickly found populist sloganeering could not save her. She discovered it was not her words but her actions which had real consequences and, even by her standards, the outcome of her government crashing down in just 45 days exceeded anyone’s expectations. Now, it stands as a testament to the extent of the decline British politics finds itself in.And things are unlikely to get much better once Truss is replaced. The immediate news after her resignation was that Boris Johnson might be about to run again. The same party membership that favours him could very easily put him back. This means more division, more internal conflict, and more incompetence could be on the way.: Boris Johnson plots his return as UK PM – mediaBut even if it’s not Boris Johnson again and a more ‘sensible’ candidate such as Rishi Sunak wins, the outlook for Britain is not favourable. The political circus takes place in a country beset by an economy on the brink of recession, growing inflation and industrial unrest. There is no reason to believe anyone who succeeds Truss is going to be able to immediately change anything. That’s because the systemic problems run deeper and farther back than the terms of the few most recent PMs, and the economy consistently fails to deliver for ordinary people.The country has never truly even recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, let alone Brexit, Covid-19 or the toll taken by the Ukraine conflict. As statistics show, real incomes have shrunk by almost £20,000 between 2008 and 2021. This led to growing social and political divides, which in turn have produced the disastrous ideological turn to the right. What, after all, paved the way for Brexit? And made the more liberal government of David Cameron untenable?When viewed like this, Liz Truss isn’t the cause of all these problems, she’s just a symptom. A symptom of a long and deep-set British decline.

Ankara was angered by the fact that it was indirectly dragged into a crime, which Turkish officials blamed on the senior leadership of Saudi Arabia.The perpetrators stood trial in their home country while the royal palace rejected assertions that Prince Mohammed personally ordered the hit. Riyadh claimed its security agents “went rogue” in Istanbul.The diplomatic rift between the two nations was partially mended in April, when Erdogan paid a visit to Saudi Arabia and met the crown prince. Amid the reconciliation process, Ankara and Riyadh toned down their mutual criticisms.

"UK is facing Dickens-style poverty, ex-PM warns — RT World News","        UK is facing Dickens-style poverty, ex-PM warns                        Gordon Brown has called on the authorities to approve an emergency budget amid skyrocketing fuel prices            ©Getty Images                  Barry Lewis  ContributorPeople in Britain are facing “a winter of dire poverty” amid skyrocketing energy costs, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Saturday, urging the government to approve an emergency budget.According to the Labour politician, the continued increase in fuel prices places “35 million people in 13m households – an unprecedented 49.6% of the population of the United Kingdom,” in risk of fuel poverty in October. Calling the situation a “financial timebomb,” he added that “there is nothing moral about indifferent leaders condemning millions of vulnerable and blameless children and pensioners to a winter of dire poverty.”This is why, Brown said, outgoing PM Boris Johnson, along with the Tory leadership candidates, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, “must this week agree an emergency budget.”: Tory frontrunner warns UK to face ‘tough winter’“If they do not, parliament should be recalled to force them to do so.” He added that if nothing is done, another fuel price rise in January will leave 54% of the population in fuel poverty.The former prime minister said the scenes he has witnessed in his home county of Fife in Scotland remind him of things he read about from the 1930s – undernourished children, “pensioners choosing whether to feed their electricity meters or themselves,” and nurses having “to queue up at their food bank.”Poverty is “hitting so hard” that charities are unable to ease the burden on people, Brown said, adding that “Britain is creating a left-out generation of young boys and girls,” whose childhoods “are starting to resemble shameful scenes from a Dickens novel.” The ex-PM vowed to fight “to renew the child poverty reduction target this government shamefully abolished.”His stark warning of the looming “dire poverty” echoes Truss’ recent remarks about the “tough winter” Britain now faces.According to the latest report from the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% in October, while GDP growth is slowing.“The United Kingdom is now projected to enter recession from the fourth quarter of this year,” the regulator said.: Pets at risk as broke Brits cut costs –RSPCAThe typical annual household fuel bill is expected to rise to around £3,500 from October, three times higher than last year. The real household post-tax income “is projected to fall sharply in 2022 and 2023, while consumption growth turns negative,” the Bank of England said.The energy crisis in Europe has been exacerbated by the sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine conflict and a decrease in Russian natural gas supplies. While the UK is not directly dependent on Moscow for fuel, it is still suffering from rising energy and cost-of-living prices.Even before the Russia-Ukraine conflict, British consumers saw sharp increases. The price cap announced by energy regulator Ofgem in early February, which went into effect in April, marked a 54% rise from the previous rate.

The deal could also include the procurement of all necessary related equipment as well as technical documentation, and spare and repair parts.Washington believes that this deal “will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States” because it could improve the security of a “partner country” in the Gulf region.According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the sale is meant to replenish the dwindling Saudi stock of Patriot missiles, while helping the kingdom to buttress its potential “to meet current and future threats.” The latter, in particular, are said to include Houthi rebels from Yemen whose attacks may compromise the well-being of the local population.The agency also noted that the Saudis would be able to integrate Patriots into its armed forces without any problems, arguing that the proposed deal will not change the military balance in the region.: Biden claims he pressed Saudi leader on journalist’s murderThe announcement comes after US President Joe Biden visited the Middle East nation last month to discuss a variety of topics, including, in particular, energy security. Biden also said he’d confronted Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman over the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.This latter controversy has marred US-Saudi relations for a long time, with then-presidential candidate Joe Biden vowing in 2019 to make the kingdom a “pariah” state. Last year, Biden also banned sales of offensive weapons to the Saudis.However, according to a Reuters report last month, the US administration has been mulling a possible lifting of these restrictions. Any decision on this matter, however, is contingent on whether Riyadh takes steps to end the war in Yemen, according to the news agency’s sources.The announcement comes as the US State Department also approved a possible arms deal with another Middle Eastern nation, United Arab Emirates. In this vein, Washington may sell to UAE 96 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system missiles, to the tune of $2.2 billion. The deal is also meant to help Abu Dhabi repel possible ballistic missile threats in the region.                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/560159-us-saudi-arms-patriot-missiles/,2022,8,3
Why the US-Saudi relationship is withering — RT World News,"        Why the US-Saudi relationship is withering                        The OPEC+ oil production cut has taught Washington that Saudi Arabia is not merely a client state to be called on to fulfill America’s political needs to its own detriment            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystFILE PHOTO: Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani meets US President Joe Biden within Jeddah Security and Development Summit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. ©                Amiri Diwan of the State of Qatar  Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesRecently, the United States was outraged by Saudi Arabia’s decision, along with the rest of the OPEC+ countries, to scale back oil production by two million barrels per day. US President Joe Biden’s administration, which had banked on the goodwill of the kingdom to facilitate a drop in oil prices in order to isolate Russia with an energy price cap, quickly threatened unspecified retaliatory action against the monarchy, which has been speculated to potentially amount to a freezing in arms sales.The row arguably puts the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia on their lowest ever trajectory. Despite having completely different ideologies, the United States has long courted the highly conservative monarchy as one of its primary strategic partners of choice in the Middle East, creating a longstanding relationship of mutual gain which involved American access to oil in exchange for security for the Saudi regime, as well as arms and cooperation against its enemies in the region.Read moreUS discussing reduction of Saudi military aid – NBCThis ‘patron-client’ relationship model defined the ties between Western powers, including France and the UK, and the other monarchies of the Gulf, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. London and Paris, the original colonial powers who dominated the region, set up this model by guaranteeing the independence of these nations, following the demise of the Ottoman Empire and establishing them as their ‘clients’, allowing the Western nations to preserve strategic, energy, and military access to the Middle East. As the 20th century progressed, the United States soon became the Middle Eastern countries’ largest patron.While this partnership has allowed Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States to enrich themselves, 2021-2022 has seen growing signs that, as the world changes, the convenience of such a partnership is starting to wither, with the OPEC row being a breaking point. First of all, the relationship between the US and the Gulf States is, as noted above, a partnership of mutual convenience, and it is just that. The drastically different political and cultural outlooks of the respective countries mean there are zero value-based or ideological connections embedded in their relationship. While the US advocates liberal democracy, Saudi Arabia advocates a hard-line Wahabi interpretation of Islamic law, which is the opposite of the Western value system.In spite of this, the United States has become increasingly aggressive in its foreign policy, as multiple geopolitical confrontations have been opened up against Russia and China, and it has sought to more readily depend on compliance from ‘friendly countries’ as it seeks to consolidate its global influence, including in this case Saudi Arabia. While countries of the global West may feel obligated to toe the line on the premise of the values the US invokes, states like Saudi Arabia do not see their relationship with Washington in the same way, and probably recognize the US’ ideological crusading as a long-term liability to themselves. What happens to Saudi Arabia, for example, if the US no longer has use of it? Saddam Hussein was one such ‘client’ before he became an enemy.Read moreSaudi Arabia ‘duped’ Washington on secret oil deal – mediaAs the Gulf States are ultimately concerned with preserving their own value systems and independence, they have increasingly diversified their relationships in recent years with tilts towards Russia and China. Beijing, with its enormous demand for energy, has also become a lucrative alternative to the West. Similarly, stable ties with Moscow also allow for cooperation in the common interests of oil-exporting countries, which has also had the effect of reducing Western influence and dominance over those countries.On recognizing this, why would Saudi Arabia and the states of OPEC voluntarily undermine their own oil revenue merely to suit the geopolitical interests of the United States? The world is in the middle of an energy price crisis exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine. Saudi Arabia sees that the US and some of its allies want to purposefully try to lower the price of oil in a bid to try and hurt Russia. However, that is not how the market works and, by extension, such a move is also an assault on Saudi and OPEC interests. While the kingdom is officially neutral in regards to Russia-Ukraine, it also recognizes that the success of an energy price cap would embolden the West to push harder against Russia, which also serves to undermine the kingdom’s geopolitical independence.In other words, if the US succeeded in dividing OPEC by unilaterally demanding a price cap on oil products, it would defeat the very purpose of the organization itself to protect the respective economic interests of those countries. The United States has been a useful partner to Saudi Arabia, but it is not a friend. It is not part of a ‘bloc’ or ideological coalition, as let’s say the UK is, but merely has seen the West as the most useful and lucrative partner to fulfil its own political needs. As those needs change, Saudi Arabia’s preferences are also subject to change. Washington is therefore learning that the kingdom is not a client state to be called on when needed, and thus this very close and often contradictory partnership is starting to strain.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/565684-us-saudi-arabia-oil-cut/,2022,10,31

In response, the UK has reportedly threatened to cancel a lucrative arms order with FN Herstal, a Belgian-based weapons company.Two weeks ago, the Belgian government refused to authorize the export of a specialized isostatic press, which is needed to maintain British nukes because the greens, who oppose nuclear weapons and make up a part of the ruling coalition, vetoed the proposal, the report says.The Belgian media also reported, citing sources, that on November 9, the government had failed to approve the export of nuclear technology intended for the British army.According to the Times, the spat escalated when Belgian officials warned that the UK could put the brakes on a €600 million ($624 million) order to procure machineguns made by FN Herstal if Brussels did not change its mind.Two senior sources in the Belgian government cited by the Times voiced concerns that the dispute could “endanger western unity and NATO” amid the Ukraine conflict.Read moreHungary faces pressure to ratify NATO expansionMeanwhile, according to Economy Minister Willy Borsus, negotiations on the contract between FN Herstal and the United Kingdom “are still underway.”The high-pressure isostatic press is used for handling radioactive waste and is involved in the manufacturing process in Britain’s Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, the UK Defense Ministry’s nuclear facility. One senior source in the Belgian government described the machinery as “unique in the world,” according to the BusinessAM website.The Times sources, however, maintain that the UK’s nuclear capabilities will remain unhampered even without Belgium’s cooperation. “Whilst we are aware of the ongoing challenge, the equipment does not affect the continuous at sea deterrent,” a Royal Navy source told the outlet.Faced with the controversy, Georges Gilkinet, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and a member of the green Ecolo party, denounced the media leaks on the matter as “a grave mistake.” Meanwhile, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said that the government has yet to take a final decision.“The British are our neighbors, our partners in many areas, including in NATO. At times like these it is important to appreciate it, but it is also necessary that the law is respected,” he said, referring to the upcoming ruling of a committee on nuclear non-proliferation.

These allegations are consistently churned out, with increasing alarm, by the ruling class in the antipodal Global North.Frantic headlines such as “Putin and Xi’s Bet on the Global South” (WSJ); “China and Russia's Lies Are Winning Over the Global South” (Bloomberg); and “How Russia is trying to win over the global south” (The Economist) from the mainstream Western media have only served to reinforce this apparent planetary dichotomy. Politico declared that the “West must seize on the Global South’s state of unease,” presumably before the unwashed citizens of this bloc become enslaved in some Sino-Russian geopolitical gulag. If this isn’t a case of neoliberal racismpumped up on neo-colonial steroids, pray tell me what is?Furthermore, as a geopolitical observer living in the so-called Global South, I am not aware of any such “unease” in Southeast Asia. If such anxieties do exist, it will be limited to an influential class who were insinuated into the levers of power by Western governments and their manifold agencies. My recent opinion piece on the British Commonwealthand its abiding neo-colonial machinations provide a backdrop to how this racket works.Read moreHeatwaves could make entire regions uninhabitable – UNNearly all the grandiose treatises on this hemispheric divide are written by pundits from the Global North. Installed puppets in the Global South, who are congenitally incapable of original thought, merely exist to parrot these fantasies — conveyed through the subtle neo-colonial worldview of a Western-led Responsibility to Protect (R2P).The plan seems to be easy: subject the world to a daily dose of alarmism until nations surrender their sovereignty to an emerging supranational order. The pervasive “coronapsychosis” we just witnessed is just a steppingstone towards this end. Sound policies that may ringfence nations during the current VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) era are routinely suppressed by “experts” from the Global North and their agitprop jesters down South. It is a lucrative plan. The global sustainable development sector is worth $20 trillion per year – representing nearly one third of the global GDP – and the South represents a green field that can be pillaged by profiteers from the North. Couched, of course, under the banner of humane philanthropy!A geographic construct?Take a look at the mapof the Global North-South divide today. It is a stark reminder of a legacy divide between modern-era colonisers (i.e., from 1500 AD) and the colonised. Russia too was a colonising power right up to either 1917 or 1991 – depending on one’s historical bias – and was therefore placed within the Global North. Its actions since the breakup of the USSR however have not conformed to the rules of the new and improvised Great Game. Instead of spoliating its own citizens and the Global South, Moscow seems more concerned with NATO’s encroachment on its doorsteps.                   World map showing a traditional definition of the North–South divide (red countries in this map are grouped as ""Global South"", blue countries as ""Global North"").     © Wikipedia                                                        There are also a few geographic incongruities in the Global North construct as it includes nations such as Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. This anomaly can – on rare occasions – lead to brief diplomatic flare-ups. The former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, once warned that Australia could become the poor “white trash of Asia”, leaving Western pundits to conduct endless damage control exercises since the alleged outburst was recorded. It was Samuel P. Huntington who situated Lee’s polemic within the context of who gets to become the United States’ sheriff in Southeast Asia. (Relentless Australian police brutality, wrought by an incurably mass “coronapsychosis,” seems to have vindicated Lee).Former US President George W. Bush settled matters over the choice of sheriff by picking Canberra in 2003. Around the same time, the Australian and New Zealand governments began accelerating an indigenized Morgenthau Plan(that was originally intended for post-WWII Germany) by systematically dismantling their manufacturing capabilities. If the reader needs a little shock here, consider the fact that there were millionaire enclaves, a mere 90-minute drive from Brisbane, that still lackedbasic ADSL or fibre optic connections in 2017!The Global North maintains a rigid pecking order that pre-empts any risk of technological challenges from its peripheries. To paraphrase Tolkien, there can only be one signet ring “to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.”That sums up the globalist plan but who wields that ring today?Russian President Vladimir Putin coincidentally hinted at this darkness during a treaty signing ceremony over the incorporation of four new regions to Russia. Putin referenced the “dictatorship of the Western elites” which targeted “all societies,” including the “citizens of Western countries themselves.” This dictatorship entailed a “renunciation of traditional values” that amounted to “pure satanism.” He even quoted the Bible, specifically Matthew 7:16 which begins with “Ye shall know them by their fruits…”But is there a biblical or historical basis to Putin’s tirade?Fruits of a satanic tree?Long before the North-South divide was dreamt up, there existed a real East-West bipolarity in the ancient global order. The East was primarily dominated by India and China, with both civilizations consistently cornering up to half of the global GDP until the late 1600s – the era of Western colonialism.Read moreEuropean country stockpiles Russian gold – BloombergIt isn’t unreasonable to treat Western colonialism as a revival of the ancient Roman empire. And for good reasons too. As Rome imposed its rule, its norms and its gods on conquered realms two millennia ago, its goldwas however haemorrhaging to ancient India in exchange for spices, muslin and silk. It is quite telling that Roman learning, technology and military hardware hardly interested the Indians, only its gold. When Christianity and Judaismfaced persecution in Rome, its adherents found refuge in the Indian subcontinent.Faced with such recalcitrant centres of power, the seeds of a unified Western-led global order were sown, ultimately growing into a predatory colonial tree. European trade guilds began to don the cloak of mystery fraternities which promised enlightenment to its initiates. The Western nobility, which profited immensely from these guilds, ensured that their mystery mumbo-jumbo would co-exist with organised Catholicism.The contradictions however were too great to be reconciled. Europe and its churches were eventually plunged into the Dark Ages. It only emerged out of a millennia of obscurantism when the German house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and the Saxon duchies began a new monarchical hierarchy in Europe. The Protestant Reformation acted as an irritant but not an impediment. The Saxon duchies later birthed the German house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha which was conveniently renamed Windsor in the United Kingdom in 1917. The cuckolded genealogiesof these dynasties are as legitimate as the mumbo-jumbo mysteries which bound them.The Catholic-Protestant-Orthodox divides gradually mattered less and less to European monarchs who patronised their respective national churches. Casualties of religious wars were generally restricted to the rabble, much like today.As colonialism, in particular Pax Britannica, reared its head, the concept of the global policeman was born. Giddy scientific rationalism also began to take root. Divinity, as defined by the Gospels, was viciously attacked. As Karl Marxdeclared: “My object in life is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism.""Read moreDmitry Trenin: Putin has proclaimed a new national idea for Russia as it abandons the dream of a Greater EuropeThe offshoots of these contradictions continue to confuse, divide, and conquer societies. In the West, gender dysphoria has reached a point of no return. Men can supposedly give birth and breastfeed children. Children are incessantly subjected to Drag Queen shows in schools. Mentioning the colour white is like stepping onto a landmine. This new “science” – promoted by elitist Western institutions no less – should be called “wokology” for want of a better catch-all term.Social divisions are festering worldwide at a pace that is unprecedented in history. The North-South divide is just a sideshow in the scheme of things. Relentless wealth fractionation is leading to a dystopian promise of “you’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy” by 2030. If this isn’t a contradiction of the highest magnitude, pray tell me what is? Besides, isn’t the total loss of ownership tantamount to slavery?There are no historical precedents to the epoch we are entering. However, there is a biblical mention of an entity of poisonous fruits which Putin had referenced in his speech. In the book of Revelations, this entity is called “Mystery Babylon” and it deceives all nations through rapacious mercantilism, colonialism, slavery and deception.

Who ended the ‘Golden Age’ of UK-China relations? — RT World News,"        Who ended the ‘Golden Age’ of UK-China relations?                        Rishi Sunak finds himself compensating for the anti-Beijing hawks in his party with his cautious engagement rhetoric            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystRishi Sunak ©                Dinendra Haria  Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesIn a notable speech last week, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declaredthe “Golden Age” of relations with China to be over. While he urged engagement with Beijing, he nonetheless branded it a competitor and a threat to “British values.”Such a so-called Golden Age had been the hallmark of his Conservative predecessors, namely the government of David Cameron, who saw Beijing as an economic opportunity for Britain in terms of trade and investment. That sentiment was also briefly signalled by Boris Johnson, until the US put its foot down.But, despite the tough-sounding speech, Sunak still found himself being branded as “weak” by right-wing anti-China MPs in his party and, worse still, accused of a U-turn by Labour. That’s because during the Conservative leadership election, Sunak seemingly presented himself as an ultra-hawk on China and branded it the biggest threat to the UK. Comparatively speaking, his recent speech was a massive climbdown.But Beijing probably won’t be getting its hopes up. If it was not evident yet, Sunak doesn’t have a clear or consistent approach towards China. In fact, his stance is riddled with contradictions. He has done nothing to back up his calls for engagement with China, and Beijing doesn’t buy it. That’s because his actions in practice have amounted to nothing but hostility, as well as a continuing succumbing to US preferences on what the UK should or should not do.: Why China is giving Britain the cold shoulderThe United Kingdom needs China, but doesn’t want to admit it. Following Brexit, the UK is seeking new trade and investment partners. It was always in the plan that China, having one of the largest consumer markets in the world, and being one of the largest investors, would be of critical importance. However, the US has succeeded in strongarming the UK, through both political and public-opinion pressure, into following its course in opposing China. This has severely limited the opportunities for Prime Ministers to engage Beijing, even if they want to.In doing so, Washington has established an effective “veto” on what Chinese investments are allowed in Britain, and which ones are not, forcing the British government to U-turn on projects they approved not once, not twice, but three times. Each time, Downing Street mysteriously discovers “national security threats” which they had ruled out previously in approving a given project. The first example was Huawei’s participation in 5G, which the original national security review had found no problems with.The second, just a few weeks ago, was a takeover by a Chinese-owned company of the Newport Wafer Fab in Wales. This project was approved in 2021 but then walked back a year later after American pressure, shocking the company and angering its employees. The third, happening just in the past week, was a Chinese stake in a nuclear power plant project. What these three examples show is that despite Brexit being about “sovereignty,” the United States otherwise exercises a malign sovereign influence over Britain’s trade and investment choices, forcing the UK each time to “cut its nose off to spite its face” by making self-defeating decisions which run contrary to the national interest and only suit American preferences.: China protests ‘flagrant violation’ by UKIn this case, it might be worth questioning who truly has brought the “Golden Era of relations” to an end? Has the UK voluntarily done so itself, or is it because the United States made them do so? Either way, this severely questions the viability of Sunak’s own bid to engage China fairly and rationally. Worse still, he now not only has to go up against opposition, not only from Washington but also from within his own party. Starting in 2020, the Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, led by Iain Duncan Smith, has evolved to become the Sinophobic wing instead. Bulldozing ties with Europe has simply been replaced in their rhetoric with alienating China, and their goal, as it was for the past 30 years, is to disrupt, undermine and sabotage the government on China policy wherever possible.And it is precisely because of this that Rishi Sunak finds himself compensating for the China hawks.

Calls for US to punish Saudi Arabia grow — RT World News,"        Calls for US to punish Saudi Arabia grow                        Lawmakers have suggested blocking arms sales after accusing Riyadh of cutting oil output to help Moscow            FILE PHOTO: US President Joe Biden and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the ""GCC+3"" meeting in Jeddah, July 16, 2022 ©                Mandel Ngan  Pool via APUS Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representative Ro Khanna have accused Saudi Arabia of “colluding” with Russia by cutting OPEC oil production quotas, supposedly to boost Moscow’s energy revenue. The two high-profile Democrats called for weapons sales to bestopped, in orderto punish Riyadh.“America shouldn’t be providing such unlimited control of strategic defense systems to an apparent ally of our greatest enemy – nuclear bomb extortionist [Russian President] VladimirPutin,” Blumenthal, Khanna and Yale business professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld wrote on Sunday in a Politico op-ed. They added that they will propose Senate and House legislation on Tuesday to immediately halt US arms sales to Saudi Arabia.On Monday, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez also called on the US government to freeze all aspects of its cooperation with Saudi Arabia. “There simply is no room to play both sides of this conflict,” he said, adding that he “will not green light any cooperation with Riyadh until the Kingdom reassesses its position with respect to the war in Ukraine.”: US hits out at OPEC over ‘unwise’ decisionAt issue is OPEC’s decision last week to cut member state oil production by 2 million barrels a day, attributed to rising interest rates in the West and a slumping global economy.With the US inflation rate near a 40-year high and congressional midterm elections approaching next month, President Joe Biden had urged Saudi Arabia to help push down crude prices.Blumenthal and Khanna, who serve on Armed Services Committees on Capitol Hill, noted that members of Congress hadlaunched unsuccessful moves to haltweapons sales to Riyadh in the past. “Due to intense bipartisan blowback to Saudi’s collusion with Russia, we think this time is different,” the op-ed said.: OPEC move balances 'chaos that the Americans create’ – KremlinThe OPEC production cut was a “pointed blow” to the US, the three authors added, arguing that the oil cartel had never before reduced quotas amid such a tight supply-demand balance in crude markets. “There was no immediate need for Saudi Arabia to reduce supply unless they were seeking to harm the US to the benefit of Russia.”Three congressional Democrats – Sean Casten, Tom Malinowski, and Susan Wild – introduced a House bill late last week calling for the US to withdraw its troops and missile defense systems from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.“Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s drastic cut in oil production, despite President Biden’s overtures to both countries in recent months, is a hostile act against the United States and a clear signal that they have chosen to side with Russia in its war against Ukraine,” the lawmakers said.Blumenthal and Khanna said the US would rather keep its troops in Saudi Arabia, than let Russia or China fill the void. They argued that the kingdom’s alleged support for Russia “should spark a far-reaching review of the US-Saudi relationship.”                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/564437-us-lawmakers-punish-saudi-arabia/,2022,10,10

Jao'Torey Johnson  US Air Force via APThe United Arab Emirates has gamed US foreign policy by meddling in the American political system using both legal and illegal tactics, intelligence officials have reportedly claimed in a classified report.The Gulf kingdom is considered to be a close ally of Washington.The activities in question spanned multiple US administrations and exploited “vulnerabilities” in the American system, including reliance on political contributions and lax enforcement of laws designed to protect against foreign interference, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Some of the tactics “resemble espionage,” the newspaper added, citing three unidentified sources who have seen the classified report.The report illustrates how the US political system is being distorted by foreign money, one Washington lawmaker told the Post, arguing that a “very clear red line needs to be established against the UAE playing in American politics. I’m not convinced we’ve ever raised this with the Emiratis at a high level.”Top US policymakers allegedly received briefings on the classified intelligence report in recent weeks. It’s an unusual advisory for US intelligence agencies to issue because it pertains to a close ally – rather than an adversary, such as Russia, China or Iran – and could be interpreted as delving into domestic politics, said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.: Top US general accused of corrupt lobbyingYousef Al Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador to Washington, defended the oil-rich nation’s outsized influence in the US. “It has been hard-earned and well-deserved,” he told the Post. “It is the product of decades of close UAE-US cooperation and effective diplomacy. It reflects common interests and shared values.”The UAE has spent more than $154 million on lobbyists since 2016, according to US government records, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars that were donated to American colleges and think tanks. Many of those institutions have produced policy papers with recommendations that are favorable to UAE interests.Those investments have apparently been fruitful, as Washington has approved sales of some of the most advanced US-made weaponry, including MQ-9 Predator drones and F-35 fighter jets, to the UAE. No other Arab nation has been afforded such privileges because US leaders have sought to avoid “diminishing Israel’s qualitative military edge” in the Middle East, the Post said.: US lawmakers want to punish Saudi Arabia and UAEBordering Saudi Arabia to the southwest and Oman to the east, oil-rich UAE is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Around 2,000 US soldiers and airmen are stationed at Abu Dhabi’s al-Dhafra airbase, and both countries supported Saudi Arabia’s war against the Houthis in Yemen, though the Pentagon ceased supporting “offensive” operations there in 2021, and the UAE withdrew its ground troops in early 2020.In early August, Washington authorized a $2.2 billion sale of 96 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system missiles, to help Abu Dhabi repel possible ballistic missile threats in the region. However, after OPEC+ members announced their decision to cut oil production last month, multiple US lawmakers accused Washington’s alliesof “siding with Russia” and proposed withdrawing troops and missile defense systems fromboth UAE and Saudi Arabia as a punishment.

Cold war under the scorching sun: How a new conflict is brewing in Africa — RT World News,"        Cold war under the scorching sun: How a new conflict is brewing in Africa                        With Israel's normalization, the feud between Algeria and Morocco is escalating            Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra said Tuesday that his country is breaking diplomatic ties with Morocco ""starting today,"" amid growing hostility between the North African neighbors, Aug.24, 2021 ©                (AP PhotoFateh Guidoum)Dubbed North Africa’s new ‘Cold War’, the tensions between Morocco and neighboring Algeria threaten to escalate and the consequences of this have a lot more to do with Western meddling in the affairs of the two countries than meets the eye.In August 2021, Algeria’s foreign minister, Ramdane Lamamra, announcedthat Algiers was severing all diplomatic ties with Rabat. “The Moroccan kingdom has never stopped its hostile actions against Algeria,” he stated at a press conference at the time. Algeria justified its move further by citing examples, such as Morocco using the Israeli Pegasus spyware against Algerian officials, supporting terrorists groups, failing to uphold bilateral commitments, the normalisation of ties with Israel, and refusing to engage diplomatically on the Western Sahara issue. Rabat has denied most of the charges laid out against it by the Algerian government.Tensions again escalated on October 31, when Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune announced the end of their gas supply contract with Rabat. This led to a reported shortage of gas in both Morocco and also Spain, which had previously received gas supplies through the Gazoduc Maghreb Europe (GME) pipeline, despite claimsmade by Moroccan officials that the move would have little impact. The following day, alleged drone strikes carried out by Morocco directly targeted clearly marked Algerian trucks near the Mauritanian border with the disputed Western Sahara region. The“barbaric attack,” as described by Ennahar, Algeria’s national broadcaster, killed 3 Algerians and generated a large outpour of rage from the Algerian government.Although many of the accusations made against Morocco by Algeria have been strongly denied, they nonetheless have a real impact on public perception of the two sides. An example of such allegations is an announcement on October 13 in which Algerian state-media claimed that the “General Directorate of National Security managed to thwart a conspiracy plot that dates back to 2014” [sic]. To blame for the attack, according to the authorities, was “the Zionist entity [Israel]” and a “North African country,” broadly interpreted to have meant Morocco.Read moreHow the Ukraine conflict could affect African nationsWhat’s interesting here is that the conflict between Morocco and Algeria has not just been limited to affecting Rabat and Algiers alone, but has also implicated several other players; notably France, Israel, Spain, and the Polisario Front that represents the national liberation movement for the Sahrawi people.To get to know more about this conflict, I spoke to Zine Labidine Ghebouli, an analyst and researcher who specializes in the political and security dynamics of Algeria. Ghebouli says that the ‘Cold War of North Africa’ “has already erupted,” claiming that this war will manifest itself in three main ways; the battle for regional supremacy, a propaganda war, and the persecution of dissenting voices. He said that “first you are going to have them [Algeria and Morocco] seeking regional supremacy, through the arms race that we have been seeing for nearly a decade now, but also through the diplomatic race. Morocco obviously normalized relations with Israel so it’s expanding its diplomatic influence. Algeria, on the other hand, is trying to devise diplomatic efforts and we have seen the visits of Foreign Minister Ramdane Lamamra to the Gulf and also to many African countries … so that’s the first way that will make either Algiers or Rabat as the leading regional power.”On the second point of escalation, he states that “you have the war of propaganda,” which “we have been seeing from the official Algerian authorities. Obviously, there are some pro-Moroccan websites that also spread disinformation about Algeria, but so far that hasn’t been the stance of the official Moroccan authorities. On the other hand, Algeria mobilized both the official and unofficial media platforms to target Rabat and social issues in Morocco, economic issues, [and] political issues and we’ve seen a lot of propaganda recently.”Zine Ghebouli then said, on the third way the war will manifest itself, “you have the judicial prosecution of activists, journalists of Algerian origins who may be perceived by Algiers as assets to the Moroccan authorities, we’ve seen with the designation of both the MAK and Rashad movements [alleged Separatist groups] as terrorist organisations … mainly with the MAK that it is [being accused of being] in contact with the Moroccan authorities to impose a security approach and this will continue, that anyone who is in contact with the Moroccan authorities will be designated as an enemy and will be treated as such.”On February 20, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of the Moroccan capital to protest rising fuel prices and an economic crisis they blame on the authorities. Similarly, Algeria witnessed a sharp economic decline, which has been going on “since last summer, because Algeria banned the imports of several products, so that led to a scarcity of foods in supermarkets … During the new year, the problem has been exacerbated by the economy of Algeria,” Ghebouli says.When asked whether he believes that the economic issues will exacerbate tensions, Zine said that “to the Algerian side the socio-economic issues are perceived as a conspiracy against Algeria, by some regional powers and that even includes Morocco implicitly,” going on to say that it’s possible that economic decline “could be perceived as an attack against Algeria.”“In that sense, the more socio-economic issues we see in Algeria and also Morocco, the more tense the situation will be, because both governments will likely try to divert the attention from these socio-economic grievances to another, what’s considered to them as an important issue, which is the security tensions. Basically, the idea is, the more we delve into the socio-economic issues, the more the tensions will increase, diplomatically and militarily.”I then asked whether the signing of the Abraham Accords, or the normalization deal between Rabat and Tel Aviv, had been a factor in the recent escalation or if this is an overreach. He replied:“When it comes to the normalization of Rabat with Tel Aviv, I think that was the last straw that broke the camel’s back when it comes to the Algerian perception, whether popularly or officially, of the Moroccan authorities. Before this normalization, Algiers was considering that all issues with Morocco could be resolved at the table of discussions, or negotiations, however, now I am afraid with the normalization that was the tip of escalation as perceived by the Algerian authorities because they consider that Morocco is taking Israel’s support with its war with Algeria. In that sense, I think that more normalization will lead to more escalation with Algeria.""Read moreIsrael signs ‘historic’ deal with ex-rival“Algiers at this point does not consider Morocco as an independent state, they consider them as a tool for what they call the Zionist project in North Africa and Algiers feels especially targeted by the normalization move, and some opinions, whether in the military institutions in Algeria or in the political scene, they do consider that it is not Algeria that is targeting Israel or Morocco, but that Israel has put Algeria on its target list and so their problem now is not with Morocco, their main problem is with Israel and has always been with Israel.”Whilst Rabat and Algiers have been in the crosshairs, tensions between Algeria and its former colonialist occupier France have also been brewing. Despite French President Emmanuel Macron condemning colonialism as a “crime against humanity” in 2017, last year Macron called into question Algeria’s very legitimacy as a nation prior to French colonialism. He also accused Algeria’s military establishment of fomenting “hatred towards France” and re-writing history, refusing to apologize for the devastating French occupation of Algerian lands. As a result, Algeria withdrew its ambassador to Paris. In October, the Algerian authorities also closed their airspace to the French military.I asked Zine Ghebouli whether he believes that the recent international condemnation of human rights abuses committed in Algeria have directly resulted from the deterioration in ties between Algiers and Paris. Ghebouli says “some reports have alluded that the new approach of the international community, vis-a-vis Algeria, is the consequence or collateral damage of the tensions with Morocco and France … I believe that there has been some engagement from some French NGOs and political actors in putting more pressure on the Algerian government when it comes to human rights conditions in Algeria and also when it comes to socio-economic reforms and foreign policy.”He noted that “the International scrutiny was lacking throughout the past few years, especially since the beginning of the protest movement in 2019. I think the international community did not want to intervene, it did not want to be there or assist [the protests] in any way, because of fear of the reaction of the Algerian authorities and also because of the post-colonial skepticism and paranoia of the Algerian society at large.”Yet, according to Ghebouli, “The international community has reached a consensus or at least a conclusion at this point, seeing the geo-political context, seeing the emerging tensions between the two countries, seeing also the situation in the Sahel [North Africa] and the instability across the region. I think the international community today considers that giving a green pass to the Algerian authorities on everything and anything does not serve the purpose of stability in the region.”For Morocco, one of the primary concerns they have with Algeria is its consistent support for the Polisario Front, which operates in the Western Sahara area, which Morocco controls the large majority of. Frente Polisario, or the Polisario Front, is considered by Rabat as a terrorist organization and a security threat. Algiers sees it, however, as a national liberation movement and hosts its government in exile. The issue of the fight over Western Sahara is that it’s considered both an occupied territory belonging to the native Sahrawi people by Polisario and an integral part of Morocco by the Kingdom’s authorities in Rabat. The United Nations considers the territory disputed and the issue is important here, as one of the guarantees made by America’s Trump administration, as part of the Israeli normalization package, was US recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara.Read moreMacron hopes tensions between Paris & Algeria are ‘calming’ after African nation recalled ambassador & barred French military jetsThe Moroccan annexation of Western Sahara in 1975 led to a devastating war, ending with a ceasefire agreement in 1991, which held for the best part of 30 years, until November 13, 2020, when Polisario declared the ceasefire over. Roughly one month later, Rabat would normalize ties with Israel.I spoke with Dr. Sidi Omar, the Polisario Front’s ambassador to the United Nations, on their ongoing conflict with the Moroccan government. He said the following, when asked about some of the costs on the Sahrawi people of the ongoing conflict between the two sides:“Human rights activists in particular are daily subjected to all sorts of violence and unspeakable atrocities without the world knowing about their plight. This is because of the media blackout imposed on Occupied Western Sahara that remains encircled by the 2700 kilometer-long Moroccan wall of shame, which is the second longest wall and the greatest military barrier in the world. The Moroccan occupying authorities have also been engaged in a large-scale scorched policy in Occupied Western Sahara. The policy, which is organized and implemented by the occupying security forces, includes destruction of houses and livelihoods, vandalism of properties, and the killing of livestock with the declared objective of uprooting Sahrawis from their homes and lands, which are given to Moroccan settlers. On the battlefield, the Moroccan forces have been using all types of weapons, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to callously kill not only Sahrawi civilians but also civilians and nationals of neighboring countries while in transit through the Sahrawi Liberated Territories [Western Saharan territories held by Polisario].”Ambassador Omar blamed Morocco’s expansionist aspirations, when asked about the recent deterioration in ties between Rabat and Algiers, and said that since the conflict between the two sides, “We [the Sahrawi people] are being subjected to a new Moroccan aggression, which is a continuation of the same expansionist policy pursued by Morocco, whose aim is to annihilate our people and seize our land.”“In addition to the continued illegal occupation of parts of Western Sahara, Morocco’s expansionism and aggressiveness show the extent to which the Moroccan regime owes its own survival to territorial conquest as a tool to divert attention from its deep-rooted domestic legitimacy crisis. Morocco’s expansionism is therefore the root cause of the enduring tension in North Africa and the main obstacle to the achievement of a united, prosperous, and inclusive Maghreb that brings together all its nations and peoples,” Omar stated.Polisario’s Sidi Omar also claimed that Israeli weapons are being used to kill civilians in Western Sahara, stating: “As for the consequences of Morocco’s ‘normalization’ deal with Israel, we have already seen an increase of military cooperation between the two countries, especially in the light of the ongoing war of aggression unleashed by Morocco on our people since November 2020. Israeli-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been frequently used by Moroccan forces to kill not only Sahrawi civilians but also civilians and nationals of neighboring countries.”Dr. Omar also voiced frustration over the normalization deal between Israel and Morocco, adding that “it is also well known that, as a quid pro quo for the deal, the outgoing US president, Donald Trump, made a proclamation declaring [the] United States’ recognition of ‘Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara’ and the intention to open an American consulate in the Sahrawi occupied city of Dajla (Dakhla). Obviously, this unilateral proclamation violates basic principles of international law, distances itself from the traditional US policy regarding Western Sahara and breaks a longstanding position on the right of self-determination of the Sahrawi people. It also infringes on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the SADR [Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic] and hampers the UN and AU efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the question of Western Sahara. Consequently, the proclamation is null and void and has no effect whatsoever.”Read moreEuropean court annuls EU-Morocco trade deals after challenge from Western Sahara secessionistsMorocco continues to tighten its ties with Tel Aviv, purchasing Israel’s Barak MX air defense systems and recently striking a deal with Israel to boost economic ties. Israeli Economy Minister Orna Barbivai signed a trade and investment cooperation agreement with her Moroccan counterpart on February 21, hoping to boost trade to 500 million dollars annually. Israel’s NewMed Energy company “is looking into the energy market in Morocco. Specifically natural gas exploration opportunities,”according to its chief executive, Yossi Abu. All making it clear that the relationship between the two countries is not going anywhere anytime soon.A major issue, of course, is how this tightening relationship will end up faring in the long run and whether it serves regional security or not. Certainly from the Algerian government's point of view, normalization serves the very opposite goal and its opposition to Morocco based upon this may well complicate the standing of Algiers in the West.Another issue that has to be analyzed is how Morocco ended up here. It is clear that the deal it signed with Israel came with certain gifts, but it has also become clear that it may have come with certain pressures too, principally from the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In February 2020, the UAE signed a $2 billion investment in facilities in Mauritania. Rabat was enraged by the investment in its southern neighbors’ port facilities at Nouadhibou. It believed that this investment by Abu Dhabi would pose a threat to its own Dakhla Port and Tangier Med projects. In March of that year, Morocco withdrew its ambassador to the UAE, sparking a feud that was followed by many accusations of Emirati pressure tactics being used against Rabat, one of which was an accusation that the UAE were backing its arch-enemy, the Polisario Front, however there is no evidence to support this claim.Suddenly, for reasons publicly unknown, the UAE decided to perform a one hundred and eighty degree shift and became the first ever Arab country to open a consulate in the Moroccan controlled Western Sahara, in October of 2020. Then, less than a month later, the Polisario Front declared the end of their ceasefire with Rabat. The normalization deals announcement came the following month and with it the US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, breaking from the international consensus. This information at the very least suggests that Morocco perhaps did not go so willingly into the normalization agreements and had external pressure applied upon it in order to pressure Rabat into the move. It is not an absolute that the above stated reasons are the sole motivators, but it is likely that they played a role to some degree.Read moreHuman trafficker explains migrant smuggling businessAs was the case during the Cold War itself, since Morocco was on the side of the West, whereas Algeria sided with the East. We now see renewed efforts by the Algerian government to align themselves with Global South liberation causes and, equally, Algiers currently maintains a friendly relationship with Russia. Interestingly, Algeria also set up a meeting in order to discuss the future of the Palestinian liberation movement and invited all key political parties, including the likes of Hamas, the PFLP, the DFLP, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. As Algeria aligns itself further with the Palestinian people in their fight for statehood, so too does the Polisario Front.In response to the question of whether Polisario is seeking greater ties with Palestinians in their struggle for self determination, Polisario’s ambassador told me that, “Efforts are ongoing to reinforce and diversify ties between the two peoples as they continue their national liberation struggles for freedom and peace.” He also added that, “The struggles waged by peoples under foreign occupation are morally and politically connected because they defend fundamental human and peoples’ rights.”All of this seems to indicate a clear alignment on a pro- and anti-Western axis when it comes to Algeria and Morocco, but whether this feud between the two and the war over Western Sahara will escalate, or simmer down through diplomacy, is very much an open question. The answer to this question may ultimately prove whether Israel’s presence in North Africa is toxic, or rather, in benefit of regional security as both Rabat and Tel Aviv claim.Robert Inlakesh isa political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK.

On Monday, the Duchess of Sussex told The Cut magazine that during the 2019 premiere of ‘The Lion King’, a South African member of the cast claimed that her wedding with Prince Harry made South Africans “rejoice in the streets the same way we did when Mandela was freed from prison.”Mandela’s grandson, however, believes that such comparisons play down the sacrifice of his grandfather and other figures that fought against apartheid, a policy of segregation and discrimination against the nonwhite majority, which existed in South Africa from 1948 to the early 1990s.Read moreNetflix dumps Meghan Markle’s project – Deadline“Madiba’s celebration was based on overcoming 350 years of colonialism with 60 years of a brutal apartheid regime in South Africa.

But [Mandela’s celebrations] were a product of the majority of our people being brought out onto the streets to exercise the right of voting for the first time,” he said, adding that even now, “there are people who want to be Nelson Mandela.”According to the Times, Zwelivelile advised the Duchess of Sussex “to pull up her sleeves and better the lives of ordinary people in England and in the United Kingdom.”“For the personality she is, she can do a lot of good in the global community by adopting the causes that Madiba championed.”Meghan Markle, former star of TV series ‘Suits’, married Prince Harry in 2018. The couple’s lavish royal wedding was widely covered by Western media and attended by many high-profile figures.

Rare are the moments of bipartisan agreement, when the democratic processes appear to flow seamlessly, allowing critical legislation to be enacted in a timely fashion.However, when Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushedthrough a massive $40 billion appropriations bill for aid to Ukraine, she did so in a single day. The text of the proposed legislation was released in the morning, a ‘debate’ was held throughout the day (in actuality, little more than a series of speeches by lawmakers on why this legislation was so important), and then a vote was taken that saw the bill approved by a 368-57 margin.Itwas then sent on to the Senate, where both the Democrat's majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the Republican minority leader, Mitch McConnell, were ready to similarly chaperone the legislation through their chamber and onto the desk of President Joe Biden, who had indicated he would sign it immediately.Then something happened that speaks to the wisdom of the Founding Fathers when they crafted the bi-cameral makeup of the US Congress. James Madison, one of the major architects of the US Constitution, had envisioned that the US Senate would function, by design, as a deliberative body, serving as a check on the potential of the House to succumb to the passions of populism.Yet when the Senate became mired in endless debate, and thus failed to advance legislation critical to the interests of the Republic, it was compelled to impose a legislative procedure designed to speed things along. Called ‘unanimous consent’, this procedure was designed to forgo the kind of lengthy debate that formed the core of the Senate’s inherent constitutional responsibility for deliberation.Read moreAmerica's selective outrage over Ukraine is fashioned by a well-oiled propaganda machine... just ask the people of YemenBoth Schumer and McConnell had envisioned the Ukraine aid bill sailing through the Senate chamber using this ‘unanimous consent’ procedure. But then Rand Paul, the junior Republican senator from Kentucky (the senior being the aforementioned McConnell), decided that his duty to the Constitution superseded his subservience to political process and refused to give his consent. “My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation and no matter how sympathetic the cause, my oath of office is to the national security of the United States of America,”Senator Paul declared. “We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy,” he continued, pointing to a 40-year-record inflation rate of 8.3% as an indicator of the economic pain being suffered by the American people. “Congress should evaluate the cost of going down this path,” Paul said. “We cannot save Ukraine by killing our economic strength. So I act to modify the bill to allow a for a special inspector general. This would be the inspector general that’s been overseeing the waste in Afghanistan and has done a great job.”Senator Paul was referring to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a position created by the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year of 2008. SIGAR’s oversight mission provided, among other things, for the carrying out and supervision of audits and investigations relating to programs funded by US taxpayer dollars appropriated by the US Congress. Inherent in this mandate was the ability to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of American funded programs and to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.One of the greatest problems faced by the US in Afghanistan, SIGAR declared, was the failure to “place a high priority on the threat of corruption in the first years of the reconstruction effort.” The problem of corruption was so great that, by 2009, Washington recognized that systemic corruption in Afghanistan represented a strategic threat to the overall Americanmission in the country. As US Ambassador Ryan Crocker noted in 2016: “The ultimate point of failure for our efforts…wasn’t an insurgency. It was the weight of endemic corruption.”From the perspective of SIGAR, two of the major reasons for the American failure in Afghanistan revolved around the failure on the part of the US government to develop an adequate sense of context, resulting in situations where “US officials often empowered powerbrokers who preyed on the population or diverted US assistance away from its intended recipients to enrich and empower themselves and their allies.”Likewise, the failure to adequately monitor and evaluate funded programs created an environment where, void of periodic reality checks, US program implementors ran the risk “of doing the wrong thing perfectly: A project that completed required tasks would be considered ‘successful,’ whether or not it had achieved or contributed to broader, more important goals.”When looking at the rush to provide Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars of US aid and assistance, one cannot help but be struck by a sense of déjà vu that Washington is repeating the same mistakes that helped produce the Afghanistan debacle. In particular, it is a failure to operate with an “adequate sense of context” regarding Ukraine while proceeding to fund programs devoid of anything resembling a properly mandated and organized monitoring and evaluation system. According to the CATO Institute, US officials (including members of Congress) “have created a stunningly misleading image of Ukraine” as “a plucky and noble bulwark of freedom and democracy. The conventional narrative would have us believe that Ukraine is an Eastern European version of Denmark.”Nothing could be further from the truth. “Ukraine,” the CATO report notes, “has long been one of the more corrupt countries in the international system. In its annual report published in January 2022, Transparency International ranked Ukraine 123rd of the 180 countries it examined, with a score of 32 on a one-to-100-point scale.”Read more'In a cage with a tiger': How locals in Taliban's Kabul adapt to the new realityThe obvious lack of contextual awareness which doomed the Afghanistan mission is very much an ongoing problem for the US when it comes to Ukraine. The failure to address the problem of corruption up front at a time when the US Congress is trying to rush through some $40 billion in appropriations seems to be little more than an instance of history repeating itself. The bill includes $11 billion in presidential drawdown authority funding that allows the White Houseto send military equipment and weapons directly from US stocks. It also provides for $6 billion in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding, which can be used to buy weapons directly from contractors and then provide those weapons to Ukraine.On the surface, this would appear to be simply about weapons. However, buried in this funding is up to a billion dollars earmarked to pay the salaries and pensions of Ukrainian government workers and soldiers. This isn’t a one-time payment – the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated that up to $7 billion per month will be needed to keep Ukraine functioning. While most US citizens might not blanch at the thought of their taxpayer dollars being used to underwrite Ukrainian soldiers and civil servants, the reality is that much of this money will be deployed to pay the salaries and pensions of ultra-right Ukrainian politicians and soldiers who espouse neo-Nazi ideology.

In the aftermath of embarrassing photographs showing US soldiers providing hands-on training to members of the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, a former independent militia drawn from the ranks of Ukraine’s right-wing supporters of Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist who fought alongside Nazi Germany during the Second World War, the US Congress, in June 2015, passed legislation that banned the training of Azov members by the US military, as well as any transfer of US weapons to Azov control.“I am grateful that the House of Representatives unanimously passed my amendments last night to ensure that our military does not train members of the repulsive neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, along with my measures to keep the dangerous and easily trafficked MANPADs out of these unstable regions,” Representative John Conyers Jr., a Democrat from Michigan, remarked after the legislation was approved.Within in a year, however, the Pentagon had lobbied the US Congress to remove Conyers’ amendment from the 2016 budget, claiming that the amendment was unnecessary in light of the existing Leahy Law, which prohibited funding to groups that have “committed a gross violation of human rights.” The problem, however, was that the US Congress had never formally designated the Azov Battalion as a group covered by the provisions of the Leahy Law. Accordingly, the US military was once again given the green light to train and equip Ukraine’s neo-Nazi military formations. Congress eventually woke up to the Pentagon’s end-around, and in 2018 reinserted the language of the 2015 Conyers amendment into the defense budget, stipulating that “none of the funds made available by this act may be used to provide arms, training or other assistance to the Azov Battalion.”The Biden administration, together with the US Congress, seems content to ignore the restrictions imposed in 2018 – none of the current funds being allocated to Ukraine are hampered by any such restrictions. Underwriting the training, equipping, and sustainment of Ukraine’s neo-Nazi element is de rigueur for American politicians, it seems.

The spectacle of the US Congress being confronted with an official report detailing how it has facilitated the use of US taxpayer dollars to underwrite neo-Nazi militancy in Ukraine, however, would not make for comfortable reading. Nor would the fact that this money was being handed over to Ukraine’s neo-Nazi element with little or no checks. Without an oversight group such as SIGAR, US taxpayers will have absolutely no idea how their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent.This is why Senator Paul’s moment of compelled Senate-level deliberation will ultimately fail. Eager to be seen defending a supposedly free and democratic Ukraine, his fellow senators seem to have fallen victim to the same self-blinding urgency as their brethren in the House. But this is a view of Ukraine that exists only in the minds of lawmakers who once knew that using US taxpayer money to underwrite Ukrainian neo-Nazis was fundamentally wrong, but who have since fallen victim to politicized Russophobia. A SIGAR empowered to audit US taxpayer dollars spent in Ukraine would be politically inconvenient, and thus will never be allowed to exist.While it seems unthinkable that the members of Congress could forget the lessons of Afghanistan so quickly when it comes to providing billions of dollars of poorly managed money to a deeply corrupt political regime in Ukraine, the reality is that the US has a history of providing military assistance to corrupt causes, all of which have failed to achieve their desired objectives.This was not always the case. In March 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped put meaning behind the phrase ‘the arsenal of democracy’ when describing the mobilization of American industry for the purpose of arming allies to defeat fascism. Under the so-called ‘Lend-Lease Act’, the US provided billions of dollars of military aid to the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. The program’s impact was undeniable, and it played a critical role in enabling America’s wartime allies to survive and ultimately defeat the threat posed by a common foe.However, since the end of the Second World War, the US has embarked on a series of misadventures where the ‘arsenal of democracy’ was engaged to support causes which, despite the infusion of American money and arms, ultimately failed. From 1961 until the fall of Saigon in April 1975, Washington spent more than $141 billionsupporting the South Vietnamese government in its war against communism, including tens of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment supplied as part of the so-called ‘Vietnamization’ program, which was designed to give the South Vietnamese military the ability to fight and win without direct US military assistance. When Saigon fell, it is estimated that North Vietnam captured some $5 billion in US military equipment, nearly half of which the North Vietnamese army was able to integrate into its force structure.In the aftermath of the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, the US spent some $25 billion rebuilding an Iraqi military capable of standing on its own two feet. And yet, less than three years after the US withdrew its combat forces from Iraq, the Iraqi army, in the summer of 2014, collapsed against the forces of the Islamic State, abandoning not only the city of Mosul and vast swaths of territory to the Islamist movement, but also billions of dollars of US military equipment, including heavy tanks and artillery.Similarly, between 2005 and 2021, the Afghan military received more than $18 billion worth of weapons from the US ‘arsenal of democracy’; but when the Afghan government collapsed in August 2021, more than $7 billion worth of advanced US military equipment fell into the hands of the Taliban.

In supporting a corrupt, ideologically unsavory government in Ukraine with billions of dollars of US military equipment, the Biden administration appears to be falling into the same trap as its predecessors who stoked the fires of US-supported conflict in South Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.By signing new ‘Lend-Lease Act’ legislation intended to fast-track US military assistance to Ukraine along the lines of the original act during the Second World War, the Biden administration ignores the lessons of history when it comes to providing military aid, namely that the cause being supported must be a just one. Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were both odious regimes deserving of the justice that the allies meted out, armed in part by the ‘arsenal of democracy.’Over time, the US has ignored the critical predicate of having a cause worthy of the sacrifice asked by those opposing it, focusing instead on sustaining through force of arms alone regimes which, in many ways, were more corrupt and unworthy of support than the forces they were arrayed against. (This is saying a lot, given that in two of these conflicts – Iraq and Afghanistan – the forces of the Islamic State and the Taliban would normally be easily classified as an enemy worth confronting.)By supporting a Ukrainian military that has been thoroughly infiltrated by the odious ideology of neo-Nazism, the US is setting itself up for failure by once again aligning itself with a cause which, in the long run, is not worthy of the sacrifice being asked of those called upon to defend it. Allowing this military assistance to go forward devoid of the kind of mandated oversight that a SIGAR-like organization would provide all but assures that not only will US taxpayer dollars be squandered in a losing cause, but that any chance of detecting the shortcomings of the aid program early on and making the kind of critical policy adjustments necessary to stave off catastrophe will be lost.Scott Ritter is a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and author of 'Disarmament in the Time of Perestroika: Arms Control and the End of the Soviet Union.'He served in the Soviet Union as an inspector implementing the INF Treaty, in General Schwarzkopf’s staff during the Gulf War, and from 1991-1998 as a UN weapons inspector.Scott Ritter is a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and author of 'Disarmament in the Time of Perestroika: Arms Control and the End of the Soviet Union.'He served in the Soviet Union as an inspector implementing the INF Treaty, in General Schwarzkopf’s staff during the Gulf War, and from 1991-1998 as a UN weapons inspector.@RealScottRitter@ScottRitterFeature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/555674-american-military-aid-trap/,2022,5,19

Wang’s comments were made at his annual media conference as China convened the National People’s Congress, the country’s top legislative body, in Beijing on Monday. Calling such plans “perverse actions” that “run counter to the common aspiration of the region for peace, development, cooperation and win-win outcomes,” Wang declared that if they were implemented by the US, “they are doomed to fail.”: Australia demands China end ‘chilling silence’Wang also criticized the US for expanding its ties, including military cooperation and weapons sales, with Taiwan. Such policies, Wang warned, “not only push Taiwan into a precarious situation, but will also bring unbearable consequences for the US side,” adding, somewhat ominously, “Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland.”China has made no secret about its claim to Taiwan, or its ambition to make good on that claim through any means necessary, including military force. While the prospects of any near-term military action by China against Taiwan have been viewed as remote, the Russian offensive in Ukraine has caused many observers to reconsider that position.The Chinese concerns are not imaginary, but rather drawn from a direct reading of the guidance published by the Biden administration in the Spring of 2021. “Our democratic alliances,” President Joe Biden declared in his interim national security strategic guidance, “enable us to present a common front, produce a unified vision, and pool our strength to promote high standards, establish effective international rules, and hold countries like China to account.”“That is why we will reaffirm, invest in, and modernize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and our alliances with Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea—which, along with our other global alliances and partnerships, are America’s greatest strategic asset,” he added.A plain reading of that text clearly shows that the US was pursuing a NATO-like alliance in the Pacific solely focused on the issue of “holding China to account.” It is in this light that one must view partnerships such as the “Quad”, a military partnership between the US, Japan, India, and Australia, and the newly constituted AUKUS alliance composed of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the US. Both organizations exist solely to coordinate a military response to China’s expansive presence in the Pacific region.: US accused of trying to create another NATOAs if to drive home the point that it will not stand by idly while the US conspires against it, Chinaannounced on Friday it was conducting a week-long military exercise in the South China Sea, near the territorial waters of Vietnam. While the scope and scale of the exercise is limited—encompassing a six nautical mile radius—its messaging was clear: China is prepared to use force, if necessary, to defend its disputed territorial claims in the region. The announcement of the exercise came on the heels of a series of military moves near Taiwan, where the transit of a US naval vessel through the Taiwan Strait was countered by the sortieing of Chinese military aircraft into Taiwan’s air-defense identification zone.Many experts and observers were surprised by Russia’s decision to intervene militarily in Ukraine. When it comes to China’s readiness to go to war over Taiwan, there should be no such uncertainty. This point was driven home by none other than the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang,in comments made to the US media on January 28. “The Taiwan issue is the biggest tinderbox between China and the United States,” Qin Gang said. “If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in the military conflict.”Qin Gang’s comments were made a week before Russian President Vladimir Putin met with China’s Xi Jinping in Beijing, where they issued a 5,000-word joint statement reaffirming “their strong mutual support for the protection of their core interests, state sovereignty and territorial integrity.”“The Russian side reaffirms its support for the One-China principle, confirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and opposes any forms of independence of Taiwan,” it reads.The fact that Russia signed on to such a statement knowing full well that China had committed to the use of military force to defend its claims regarding Taiwan underscores the seriousness of the Russian-Sino joint statement and helps explain Chinese silence when it comes to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, which run afoul of China’s long-standing objection to military intervention.: Russia-China trade turnover up almost 40% in two monthsChina knows that any military action against Taiwan would bring with it economic retaliation on the part of the US and its allies. Like Russia, however, China holds significant cards in its hand, and any Western effort to punish it with economic sanctions would bring about a response which could cripple the economies of those targeted. Moreover, any military action against Taiwan would, in and of itself, have dire global economic consequences, especially in the field of semiconductor manufacturing. Any military conflict involving Taiwan would have a crippling impact on the global electronics market, dependent as it is on the computer chips produced by Taiwan.The relationship between Russia’s action on Ukraine and any move by Beijing against Taipei, or active defense of its South China Sea territorial claims, is real. While the conflict in Ukraine is thousands of miles away from either Taiwan or the South China Sea, the lessons on how the West is reacting to Russia’s attack are, without question, being closely studied by the Chinese leadership with an eye on how the West might respond to any future Chinese military action.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/551435-china-us-taiwan-pacific-ukraine/,2022,3,7

However, in 2018 the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement, with then-President Donald Trump describing the deal as flawed.However, the administration of US President Joe Biden has repeatedly said it is ready to engage with Iran on the matter. Subsequently, negotiations on reviving the deal kicked off in April 2021 in the Austrian capital, which resulted in hammering out the so-called “final” draft text of the agreement in August 2022.Since then, the negotiations have stalled, however, with Washington unwilling to lift all anti-Iranian sanctions and refusing to give guarantees that it would not exit the agreement again.Earlier this month, the US also imposed new sanctions on Iran’s petroleum industry, targeting entities that sought to bypass restrictions that had already been in place.

Why China is giving Britain the cold shoulder — RT World News,"        Why China is giving Britain the cold shoulder                        Rishi Sunak’s hawkish antagonization of Beijing has not gone unnoticed, despite his recent softening            ByTimur Fomenko, a political analystChinese President Xi Jinping ©                Popow  ullstein bild via Getty ImagesSince the conclusion of China’s 20th Communist Party Congress, Xi Jinping has been on a diplomatic blitzkrieg. He’s met with leaders from countries all over the world, including the German chancellor, the French president and even US President Joe Biden himself. He’s keeping up the momentum as New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has receivedan invitation to visit Beijing. China believes that diplomacy is critical to prevent the US from isolating it.But one important country has thus far been left on the sidelines – the United Kingdom. A meeting between Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, scheduled at the UK’s request during the recent G20 summit, was cancelled. It came just as Sunak, at least superficially, softenedhis rhetoric on Beijing and sought to re-engage, after having portrayed himself as an ultra-hawk during the leadership contest at home. He even scrapped Liz Truss’s designation of Beijing as a “security threat” to his country.But that hasn’t saved him from Beijing’s wrath. China is getting tough on Britain, in a similar way to how it did on Scott Morrison’s Australia. While the impasse with Canberra ended with the election of Antony Albanese as Prime Minister, who is more pragmatic in handling China ties, Beijing now sees London as the one playing the role of the “insufferable poodle” of the US, and will likely deliberately block engagement until it changes course.Read moreRishi Sunak seeks to score easy political points by closing down Chinese institutesOut of all allies of the United States, China is especially wary of what is known as “The Anglosphere” or the “Five Eyes” – That is Australia, Canada, New Zealand (although not these days) and the United Kingdom. These Anglophone countries, direct products of the British Empire, are the states which are most invested in American hegemony and closest to the United States in terms of ideology and worldview. While Continental European nations may to varying degrees differentiate themselves from the US, the Anglosphere nations are “true believers” in the US cause.Hence, when the US invaded Iraq, it was the UK and Australia who answered the call, just to cite one instance. China therefore naturally sees members of the Five Eyes with geopolitical suspicion. Additionally, Beijing does not see them as truly “sovereign” countries or as equals to itself, but rather as US vassals. However, it has to balance this with the reality that all of these countries are critical economic and trade partners, due to their accumulated wealth and market influence. In which case, China’s geopolitical objectives is not to treat these countries as adversaries, but to use a very explicit “carrot and stick” mode of diplomacy whereby it punishes them for “bad behaviour” in following the US too closely on the one hand, but rewards them for deeper bilateral engagement on the other.And there is no more explicit example of this ongoing right now than the contrast between China deepening its engagement with New Zealand and shutting out the United Kingdom. When Beijing deems that a leader of an Anglosphere state, such as Scott Morrison of Australia, or Rishi Sunak of the UK, is too deeply following the United States, then there is absolutely no point in engaging them because the fundamental decisions are being made in Washington and not their respective capitals. The metric of right-wing populism, when these respective leaders are actively demonizing China for domestic political gain, is also a ‘naughty step’ offense. Only the US has the political privilege and power to be able to demonize Beijing, but still get engagement with it, hence why America is able to provoke China and never receive the reactions which smaller nations get from China.Read moreIt’s no surprise many Brits would prefer ‘some form of dictatorship’This is how Beijing tries to “dilute” American power. The US itself is never confronted, but those who follow Washington too closely are. And on this, China has caught Sunak off guard. Beijing tolerated the government of Boris Johnson because he described himself as a “Sinophile” determined to improve ties with China. Sunak, however, used antagonism of China for partisan gain. The Prime Minister has since moderated his rhetoric and spoken about “keeping ties open,” believing that his spree of anti-China hyperbole, as well as a recent Ministerial visit to Taiwan, would simply be brushed off and that Beijing would welcome him with open arms. He was wrong, and Beijing is now showing that when it is not about the US, engagement with China is conditional on “good behaviour.”China also recognizes the UK economy is weak, and as loath as London is to admit it, the UK needs ties with China. Inflation is surging, industrial unrest is picking up, chancellor Jeremy Hunt says the country is already in a state of recession. In which case, Beijing is exploiting these vulnerabilities and, similar to Australia, it will place a number of “demands” on Britain which will become pre-requisites to normalization again, which usually involve respecting Beijing’s position on Taiwan and not following the US agenda.However, whether this works is another story. In the case of Australia, Scott Morrison’s government did not change course, and it simply became the case that China had to wait him out before re-engaging with his successor. That could very much be the case here too. Britain has ultimately made the choice to follow the US on China, even when those policies prove to be blatantly self-defeating, as is the case with the Newport Wafer Fab. Nonetheless, if Sunak is trying to be pragmatic, this should be a reality check for him.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/567059-rishi-sunak-beijing-uk/,2022,11,23

The legislation, which will be launched this week, comes as part of the government’s pledge to ""tackle illegal migration.""""Illegal migration is not fair on British taxpayers, it is not fair on those who come here legally and it is not right that criminal gangs should be allowed to continue their immoral trade,"" Sunak said in an interview with the Mail on Sunday. ""So, make no mistake, if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay.""Provisionally titled the Illegal Migration Bill, the new law will seek to make asylum claims by people who enter the country with the use of small vessels inadmissible by British law. Such migrants would be removed from the UK ""as soon as reasonably practicable"" to Rwanda or to a ""safe third country."" Asylum seekers who violate the law will also be banned from returning to the UK.Read moreDozens dead after migrant shipwreck off ItalyThe UK and Rwanda agreed to a five-year ‘asylum partnership arrangement’ in 2022, under which asylum-seekers will be permitted to seek asylum in the African country.

Human rights campaigners have also been heavily critical of the plan.Asylum-seekers looking to gain entry to the UK have rights protected by the UN’s Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Illegal Migration Bill will have a ""rights break,"" which would effectively circumvent the UN’s refugee convention, according to the Mail on Sunday.Critics of the legislation say that the law will not prevent illegal entry, but instead result in thousands of asylum seekers being detained at huge expense to the UK taxpayer.

Israeli spyware targeted Boris Johnson – report — RT World News,"        Israeli spyware targeted Boris Johnson –report                        Pegasus spyware targeted European leaders and figures in the Catalan independence movement, according to a cyber research firm            FILE PHOTO: The logo for the Israeli NSO Group company is seen near Sapir, Israel August 24, 2021. ©                AP  Sebastian ScheinerDozens of high-profile politicians and activists across Europe have been targeted for surveillance with the infamous Pegasus spyware, according to new research, with the reported victims including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a number of Catalan independence leaders in Spain.Findings published on Monday by Toronto-based cyber research firm Citizen Lab indicate that the Israeli-developed Pegasus spyware program was used to illicitly surveil government institutions in the United Kingdom between 2020 and 2021, among them the prime minister’s office on 10 Downing Street and the the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCO).“When we found the No. 10 case, my jaw dropped,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, told the New Yorker in an interview, while another employee said the lab suspects the breach “included the exfiltration of data.”: Israel insists it only ‘legally’ spies on citizensThough London has declined to say what software was used, an unnamed official confirmed to the outlet that government networks were “compromised,” noting that the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre later analyzed some of the devices thought to have been targeted, including Johnson’s. The infected phones or computers were unable to be identified, however, with the official stating “it’s a bloody hard job.” Whether any data was stolen, or what it might have included, remains unknown.According to the researchers, the suspected breaches related to the FCO are believed to have been carried out from the United Arab Emirates, India, Cyprus and Jordan, while the attack on the PM’s office may have originated in the UAE. The Emirati government has been implicated in previous spying charges linked to the Pegasus program, including surveillance related to the brutally murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.Moreover, more than 60 phones linked to Catalan activists were reportedly infiltrated between 2015 and 2020, including those belonging to lawyers, politicians and members of the European Parliament who’ve backed independence for the region in northeastern Spain. The New Yorker dubbed it the “largest forensically documented cluster of such attacks and infections on record.”“Every Catalan Member of the European Parliament (MEP) that supported independence was targeted either directly with Pegasus, or via suspected relational targeting,” Citizen Lab said. “Three MEPs were directly infected, two more had staff, family members, or close associates targeted with Pegasus.”Though the origin of the latter attacks remain unclear, Catalan politicians have pointed fingers toward the Spanish government, while previous reporting in local media indicates Spanish intelligence services have employed the Pegasus program in the past, specifically against independence figures.The government has yet to respond to the charge, though the developer of Pegasus – Israeli cyber firm NSO Group – has denied the claims unequivocally, telling the New Yorker “These allegations are, yet again, false,” having previously rebutted similar accusations in the past. Despite a litany of other spying claims in the past, the company has insisted its products are used exclusively for legal law enforcement purposes only.:    Major human rights group among Pegasus spyware targets                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/554119-pegasus-spying-europe-catalonia/,2022,4,19

This represents a loss for the administration of US President Joe Biden and will have wide-ranging consequences for Palestinians.Israelis went to the ballot box for the fifth time in three years on Tuesday, paving the way towards another government headed by the Likud Party’s Benjamin Netanyahu. However, the return to powerof the longest-serving Israeli Prime Minister comeslargelythanks to the rise of the infamous ultra-nationalist Religious Zionism alliance, with which Netanyahu had signed an agreement promising government positions in exchange for support.Religious Zionism subsequently emerged as the third largest list elected to Israel’s parliament, the Knesset. This means that Benjamin Netanyahu will be at the mercy of politicians that were once known as fringe and were labeled as a “danger to Israel” by the editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post.Read moreNetanyahu wins Israeli electionThe two most prominent Religious Zionism figures are Itamar Ben-Gvir of the ‘Jewish Power’ Party and Bezalel Smotrich of the ‘National Union-Tkuma’ party. The former is a disciple of the ultranationalist extremist Meir Kahane, whose Kach Party was banned from running for a seat in the Knesset in 1988, for being “manifestly racist,” and which was later labeled a terrorist group by both Tel Aviv and Washington.Ben-Gvir took over the ‘Jewish Power’ party from his colleague Ben-Zion Gopstein, who was also banned from running for the Knesset over racist remarks, and who currently heads the group known as Lehava, which advocates segregation and the prevention of mixed marriages between Jews and Arabs. Ben-Gvir has been prosecuted in Israel over 53 times, by his own admission, for the likes of backing a terrorist group,inciting racism and for violence against Arabs.Bezalel Smotrich, on the other hand, has advocated the segregation of Arabs and Jews in maternity wards and claims that God commands that Jews not sell their homes to Arabs. Smotrich was labeled by a top UK Jewish body as promoting a “hate-provoking ideology” and told to leave the United Kingdom, while on a tour of Jewish communities.Likewise, Itamar Ben-Gvir’s Jewish Power party was last yearlabelled“racist and reprehensible” by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The fact that publicationssuch as the Jerusalem Post call them “fascistic” and that vehemently pro-Israel groups in both the United States and United Kingdom have labeled these figures racist, gives an idea of just how divisive they are.Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are eyeing high-ranking ministerial positions in any Netanyahu-led government, meaning that not only will the Religious Zionism alliance have the power to greatly influence the incoming government’s policies, but will likely strive to be active players in the cabinet.“We’ll reassert ownership of this state,”said Ben-Gvir in a speech after exit polls had shown large gains for Religious Zionism, which seeks to overhaul Israel’s legal system and to deport Palestinian citizens of Israel if they display “disloyalty” to the Jewish State. From a US perspective, a Biden administration officialis reported to have told Israel Hayom news that they were against the likes of Itamar Ben-Gvir becoming a minister in any Israeli government.Read moreA third Palestinian intifada: With political leaders becoming increasingly unpopular, a new armed uprising takes holdAccording to analysis by Shalom Lipner, who served the Israeli PM’s office from 1990 to 2016, and published in ‘Foreign Policy’, a majority win for the Netanyahu bloc would put him at the mercy of the ultranationalists of Religious Zionism and could cause a schism between Tel Aviv and Washington.Religious Zionism will also push for other policy priorities, including long-term prison sentences for illegal immigrants, as well as introducing the death penalty for Palestinian citizens of Israel that kill Jewish Israelis, and for revoking the citizenships of Palestinian-Israelis for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli Jews.Another controversial policy position is the cancellation of a provision within the Law of Return for Jews, which currently entitles anyone with a Jewish grandparent to claim Israeli citizenship even if they aren’t Jewish themselves. If this amendment to the Jewish Law of Return is adopted by the incoming government, it could greatly impact immigration to Israel from around the world and may cause a backlash from Jewish communities around the globe.What has been largely glossed over, however, is how such an Israeli government would impact Palestinians in the Palestinian Authority (PA). Back in September, then Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, entertaining the idea of a two-State solution, as did PA President Mahmoud Abbas and US President Joe Biden. Yair Lapid and then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz were both making a greater effort to strengthen the PA in the West Bank, in order to allow it confront the growing number of armed Palestinian groups in the occupied territory. If the Netanyahu-led far-right government that seems destined to rule is inaugurated, it is likely to flatly reject any talk of a two-State solution.The problem for both the Palestinian Authority and Israel is that they both need each other in order to prevent the armed uprising in the West Bank from growing even further.If Mahmoud Abbas is snubbed by Netanyahu and the PA is put in a chokeholdunder the influenceof Religious Zionism, the Palestinian Authority will be forced to either fight Israel or face a possible rebellion from within.Furthermore, if the PA cannot be effective against grassroots Palestinian movements, NGOs and newly-formed armed groups, then the Israeli army will be forced to do all the heavy lifting, which means escalation and even greater bloodshed.If we combine the policies which could be on the way for dealing with Palestinians under occupation, with the possible injustices that may be carried out against Palestinian citizens of Israel, the stage may well be set for a large-scale Palestinian uprising. Not only have the Israeli public voted for a radical right-wing government, but they may have just voted for a massive escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict, too.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/566008-israel-netanyahu-religious-zionism/,2022,11,5

With Dublin remaining a member of the multinational union, the status of trade between it and Northern Ireland – six counties on the island that stayed part of the United Kingdom after Ireland’s independence a century ago – had to be regulated through the special protocol.“That’s what I find shocking and hard to accept. The British government wants to impose solutions on Northern Ireland that most people in Northern Ireland don’t want.

We will work with them to ensure regional security, support the humanitarian relief effort and stabilise global energy markets for the longer term.”The PM will first meet with Emirati Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed before heading to Saudi Arabia for a sit-down with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where he’s expected to discuss increasing Gulf energy output as the UK seeks to cut down on Russian imports.: US urges India to think twice before buying Russian oilThe visit was slammed by some lawmakers, as it comes soon after Riyadh’s largest-ever public execution, in which it killed 81 prisoners.

As of late 2021, nearly 400,000 people had been killed in the conflict, according to UN estimates, most of them Yemeni children under the age of 5.

Opposing and defeating such attempts is meant to avoid war and safeguard peace and stability in the region.Zheng also urged Britain to avoid following in the “footsteps of the US,” citing recent visits by senior American lawmakers to Taiwan, and noted that the island “has always been a sensitive matter at the center of relations between the UK and China.”#China urges the #US to stop playing the ""#Taiwan card"" and not to go further down the path of creating crisis.

In a decision on Tuesday, the court ruled that the prince was entitled to immunity as a foreign head of state.In a 25-page ruling, Judge John Bates admitted, however, that he was reluctant to throw out the lawsuit filed by Khashoggi’s fiance as it contained “credible allegations” against MBS. The judge explained that he had no choice but to dismiss the case as his hands were essentially tied after the crown prince was appointed prime minister of Saudi Arabia and US President Joe Biden granted him sovereign immunity in a court filing submitted last month.“Despite the Court’s uneasiness, then, with both the circumstances of bin Salman’s appointment and the credible allegations of his involvement in Khashoggi’s murder, the United States has informed the Court that he is immune,” Bates wrote.Prince Mohammed was appointed head of the Saudi state in September under royal decreeby his father King Salman, almost four years after Khashoggi was brutally killed and dismembered by Saudi agents in the Gulf state’s consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. US intelligence services determined that the assassination was personally ordered by MBS who had already been the kingdom’s de facto ruler for several years.Read moreBiden accused of ‘capitulation’ to SaudisThe prince has admitted that the murder happened “under his watch,” but has denied having any involvement, far less ordering or approving it.

However, Sturgeon insisted last week that Scotland would not have to adopt the euro as its currency, stating that it would continue using the British pound before moving to its own Scottish pound.Sturgeon’s conservative opponents argued otherwise, and multiple EU officials have now confirmed this, telling the Herald on Sunday that the euro would be non-negotiable.Read moreCourt to rule on timing of  Scottish independence vote“All EU member states, except Denmark which has an opt-out clause, are legally committed to join the euro area once they fulfil the necessary conditions,” an economic affairs spokeswoman at the European Commission told the newspaper.European Policy Centre chief Dr. Fabian Zuleeg added that newcomers to the bloc wouldn’t be granted the same opt-out that Denmark negotiated. “It would be much harder, if not impossible, for a new member to negotiate such a permanent opt-out,” he said. “However, it might be possible to negotiate essentially a grace period.”The United Kingdom also enjoyed such an opt-out when it was an EU member. While Sturgeon cited Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden as member states using their own currencies, the European Commission spokeswoman said that these states are all required to work towards joining the single currency, although “no timetable is prescribed.""Crucially, the euro is currently reeling from the effects of the EU’s sanctions on Russian fossil fuels, and has sat at parity or lower with the US dollar since August – a record low for the two-decade-old currency.

The jury’s out,” she said late on Thursday.Macron was asked to comment on the remarks during his trip to Algeria, telling Truss that it was actually “not good to lose your bearings too much.” He also appeared to steer the personal-sounding statement by Truss into a broader question about the relationship between their two countries, unequivocally stating that “France is a friend of the British people.” : Macron calls Putin“The British people, the United Kingdom, is a friendly, strong and allied nation, regardless of its leaders, and sometimes in spite of its leaders or the little mistakes they may make in grandstanding,” Macron said.“If we are not capable, between France and Britain, of saying whether we are friends or enemies – the term is not neutral – we are heading towards serious problems,” he warned.Outgoing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has rushed to soften the remarks by his potential successor, insisting that Macron has personally always been a “very good buddy” to London.“I think I've always had very good relations with Emmanuel Macron.

To do these things, we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes,” Biden wrote, adding that Saudi Arabia is one of those nations.The president listed some practical benefits of “reorienting” relations “with a country that’s been a strategic partner for 80 years.”“Its waterways are essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on. Its energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies of Russia’s war in Ukraine,” the American leader said, revealing that oil-rich Saudi Arabia is now working with US experts “to help stabilize oil markets with other OPEC producers.”: Reality trumps principles as Biden plans a meeting with the Saudi crown princeBiden also stressed that “violent extremism” is less likely to rise in a region “that’s coming together through diplomacy and cooperation.”Admitting that his visit is seen by many as controversial, Biden said his administration had reversed “the blank-check policy” towards Riyadh by releasing the intelligence report on the murder of a Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 in Turkey (which deemed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for ordering the killing) and imposing new sanctions on the state. Riyadh claimed its security agents “went rogue” in Istanbul.“My administration has made clear that the United States will not tolerate extraterritorial threats and harassment against dissidents and activists by any government,” Biden said, at the same time hailing some of Riyadh’s achievements in international politics.Biden used his op-ed to contrast his own administration’s policies in the Middle East with those of Donald Trump, whom he referred to only as “my predecessor” without ever mentioning his name.Biden is scheduled to travel to the Middle East from July 13 to July 16. He will make stops in Israel, the West Bank and Saudi Arabia. In his op-ed, the president emphasized the symbolic meaning of his direct flight from Israel to Saudi Arabia.“That travel will also be a small symbol of the budding relations and steps toward normalization between Israel and the Arab world, which my administration is working to deepen and expand,” he explained.The announcement of the president’s visit to Saudi Arabia and especially his upcoming meeting with the Crown Prince has drawn harsh criticism as Biden had previously pledged to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over Khashoggi’s murder.

However, shortly after he started making his opening statements, the channel’s president, Ksenia Fedorova, reported that Twitter had unexpectedly decided to ban RT France’s Communication service channel on the entire territory of the European Union.Read more‘It takes two to tango’, but West ‘breakdancing alone’ – LavrovFedorova blasted Twitter’s decision as a “step closer to total censorship,” noting that the account of the communication service of RT France was “solely dedicated to information on our channel.”“Apparently they didn’t want to give supporters of our channel the opportunity to spread information about the hearing,”she noted on her Telegram channel.The session continued as Piwnica made the case that RT France was a French company and a media outlet authorized by the French audiovisual regulator ARCOM, which has never sanctioned the channel.He insisted that the censorship imposed by the EU was illegal under the bloc’s own laws, which do not allow the Council to ban any media, and that the sanctions constituted an attack on pluralism and freedom of expression.“RT France must be silent, says the Council of the EU, because RT France would be a propaganda tool for the Russian Federation. RT France would not have the right to speak. False, it is not a propaganda tool. The position of the Council is illegal!” Piwnica argued.He added that the only thing the Council really wanted was the complete disappearance of RT France because of “war,” but noted that “even the war does not allow the Council of the EU to act, the legislation does not allow it!”Piwnica insisted that a conflict between two third states did not allow the Council to free itself from the “legal framework which determines its powers” and that no assessment of RT France’s editorial content has been carried out to justify the censorship and prove the claims of ‘propaganda’.“It is precisely in times of crisis, of war, that fundamental rights are essential for everyone … I ask you to cancel the decision of the European Union to prohibit the broadcasting of RT France within the European Union,” Piwnica concluded.Read moreFrance starts handing out food stamps – mediaRepresentatives of the Council responded by justifying the “exceptional measure” by stating that since RT was funded by a state “whose leader has launched a war against a sovereign state” it was not treated as “ordinary media by a propaganda organ.”EU Commission representative Daniel Calleja Crespo insisted that the objective of the ban was to “protect the European public order against Russian aggression against Ukraine” and argued that the legal measures taken by the Council were compatible with the bloc's laws.Later in the hearing, representatives of the participating EU member states took turns proclaiming support for the Council’s decision, with most of them arguing that RT was “propaganda” and “part of a modern war arsenal” that should not be granted the right to freedom of expression over, what they judged as, its support for Russian's military offensivein Ukraine.At the same time, none of the speakers accusing RT France of propaganda, during the hearing, have presented any specific examples or evidence of the channel’s alleged transgressions.RT France initially filed its appeal on March 8, requesting the EU reverse its March 1 decision to ban the broadcasting of the channel in all member countries. The networkhas insisted that the ban is illegal and an example of unfounded censorship by the EU, one which constituted a “serious attack on freedom of speech.”Meanwhile, the Council has maintained that all RT channels, and RT France in particular, are considered to be Russian propaganda weapons used to justify and legitimize Russia’s war in Ukraine.The Council has justified its classification of RT France as ‘propaganda’ by pointing to the fact that the channel is entirely funded by the state, has been banned by other countries – such as the United Kingdom – and that it allegedly disseminated propaganda on at least one instance on February 24, 2022.Read moreRussia kicks out Canadian state mediaRT France defended itself by pointing to the fact that its source of funding has been widely known and that it in itself does not justifya ban as there are countless examples of state-funded media projects that have never been subjected to any sanctions, including France24.The channel also maintains that it is editorially independent and has never been sanctioned by the French regulator CSAARCOM, which is supposed to be the only authority with the legal right to sanction a TV channel, in the country.As for the alleged ‘dissemination of propaganda’ claimed by the EU, RT France’s legal team has provided evidence that the elements of its broadcast, deemed to be ‘propaganda’ by the Council, actually represented all points of view and contained the exact same information which was being covered by other media channels which have not faced any sanctions or accusations of propaganda.The channel has insisted that all the sources of information distributed by RT France were always clearly indicated and that the act of relaying the point of view of Russia is not in itself illegaland merely represents information provided to the media.RT France surmises that its mode of funding, and not the content of its broadcast, has been the sole underlying reason for its ban and insists that the Council has no right to assess or qualify the editorial content of any channel, as that function is specifically and exclusively assigned to national regulators who would otherwise be simply denied their role.

A view of the Detention Centre in Gjilan. © Getty Images  Erkin Keci Denmark will be sending foreign nationals convicted in the country to serve their sentences in a Kosovo prison, the countries’ respective justice ministers agreed on Wednesday. Should both sides' parliaments give the accord the green light, the first inmates could be transferred to the Balkans as early as next year.Danish Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup and his Kosovo colleague Albulena Haxhiu have signed off on a deal that reserves some 300 cells in a Kosovo prison for Danish migrant convicts. According to the scheme, inmates who are not Danish nationals will be serving sentences meted out by Danish courts in a prison located in the Kosovo city of Gjilan. The penitentiary facility will, however, first have to be refurbished so that conditions in there are in line with those found in Danish jails.After the inmates have served their time, they will be deported back to their countries of origin.The accord signed on Wednesday was preceded by a preliminary agreement between Copenhagen and Pristina in December 2021. The BBC reported at the time that Denmark would shell out €15 million annually for an initial period of five years. On top of that, Copenhagen will reportedly help Pristina develop green energy in the Balkan region in exchange.The Danish justice minister hailed the deal as “ground-breaking,” adding that it would help the kingdom better manage its own “overcrowded prisons and will ease the pressure on our prison officers.”Haekkerup also noted that the agreement “sends a clear signal to foreigners from third-party countries who have been sentenced to deportation” that their “future is not in Denmark and therefore you won't serve your sentence here.”Commenting on the news to Denmark’s Ritzau media outlet, the official expressed hope that the “practical side of things can be ready in the first quarter of 2023.”: UK government and Church in Easter migration clashAccording to official data cited by the media, the number of inmates in Denmark has ballooned by almost 20% since 2015, reaching over 4,000 in early 2021, and the Scandinavian country’s prison system has been operating at capacity.The deal struck between Denmark and Kosovo comes weeks after the UK government revealed plans to send asylum seekers arriving in that country to Rwanda, where they would await as their applications are processed by British authorities. The Times reported at the time that only male migrants would be flown to the central African nation.In early April, British Home Secretary Priti Patel traveled to the African country which had finalized a “migration and economic development partnership” with the UK. It followed previous failed attempts to strike similar deals with Albania and Ghana.It is, however, not clear at this point if the holding facilities in Rwanda will be under UK jurisdiction.The Labour opposition slammed the scheme as an “unworkable, unethical and extortionate policy that would cost the UK taxpayer billions of pounds during a cost of living crisis and would make it harder, not easier, to get fast and fair asylum decisions.”The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, too, expressed concern over London’s plans.In 2020, Human Rights Watch issued a report claiming that detainees in Rwanda suffer from arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial facilities.

Upon closer examination, it turns out that the vast majority of global statesare dealing with some form of separatist issues, ranging from significant to very minor.A Balkan Patchwork QuiltThe disputed statusof Kosovo is only the latest instance of separatism resulting in the emergence of a new state-like entity in the Balkans. The disintegration of the region has been dubbed ‘Balkanization’, and deservedly so.At the end of the last century, most of the Balkans were incorporated into a united country called Yugoslavia. Today, there are seven independent countries in its place, but this is by no means where it might end.Serbia was the first to face the problem of Albanian separatism, but there are Albanian communities in other nations throughout the region – including Montenegro, Greece, and Northern Macedonia. In the latter, the threat is especially acute, since Albanians, who account for 25% of the country’s total population, live in the country’s western regions adjacent to Kosovo.

In the northern part of the province, there is an enclave populated mainly by Serbs, who do not like the prospect of being isolated from their larger homeland. Likewise, problems with separatism have inevitably arisen in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Republika Srpska, which is part of it, looks towards independence or reunification with Serbia and has increasingly expressed views on the future that contradict those of the central government.Read moreWestern diplomacy is immature and incapable of dialogue – Russian ambassador to IndiaThe same problem, though less acute, can be found in Croatian enclaves of Bosnia, as well as Croatia itself, where there are enclaves of Serbs.Iberian Peninsula: Two Countries Aren’t EnoughIf there wasn’t a king sitting in Madrid who still unites most of the peninsula, ‘Balkanization’ might well have been called ‘Iberization’ – there are more separatist movements in Spain than any other Western European country.The whole world is well aware of the problem of Catalonia. Just five years ago, in October 2017, the local authorities there held a referendum on independence, which ended in failure, despite the fact that more than 90% of those who voted supported the separation of the region from Spain. Madrid refused to recognize this expression of the people’s will. In the aftermath, some of the leaders of the Catalan separatist movement were arrested, while others managed to flee the country. However, this has hardly quashed the desire of local residents.In addition to the Catalan issue, there is also Basque separatism, which, unlike the Catalonian variety, often takes on more radical forms. Radical nationalists from ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna – Basque Country and Freedom) fought for independence from Spain and the Spanish crown for more than 40 years, killing 800 people.

While not reaching the level of separatism, the idea of regional autonomy flourishes in each of them to one degree or another. In localelections, candidates who call for more independence and autonomy regularly garner a large percentage of the vote in Aragon, Andalusia, Castile, Asturias, Cantabria, and Galicia, as well as other autonomous communities.And not all is sweetness and light in the Iberian peninsula’s other country, Portugal, either… though it’s true that the regions seeking to free themselves from the power of Lisbon are separated from that metropolis by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean: we’re talking the archipelago of Madeira and the Azores.Read moreHollywood abandoned Russia one year ago, but the country's box office has just set an all time record: How did this happen?Britain: A disunited KingdomScottish separatism has been haunting London for the past few years. After independence supporters won the last regional elections, they announced their intention to hold a second referendum on seceding from the United Kingdom. The first was held in 2014, when 55% opposed the divorce, and 45% supported it. Confident in the results of the vote, London didn’t interfere with the will of the Scots at that time.However, two years later, the UK voted to leave the European Union, and Edinburghdemanded a new referendum, as Scotsclearly wanted to stay in the EU, having voted against by a landslide 62%. The Scottish authorities had wanted to hold a new referendum in October 2023, but, last November, Great Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that plebiscites on independence cannot be held without London’s consent. This time the Tory-controlled parliament does not intend to grant it. Edinburgh has no intention of giving up, with the former head of the Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon promising “Scottishdemocracy will not be denied.”Last week,Sturgeon announced her resignation as Scotland’s first minister, but still, speaking of her successor, she expressed confidence that the person “will lead Scotland to independence.”                   FILE PHOTO.

In local elections in the spring of 2022, the Sinn Fein party, which advocates for reuniting with the Republic of Ireland and seceding from the Uk, won regional elections for the first time. The Northern Ireland Protocol, signed between London and the EU during Brexit, probably contributed to the separatists’ growing popularity. The document calls for preserving a single customs space between Dublin and Belfast, while actually introducing customs between Britain and Northern Ireland.London'sissues don’t stop there with varying degrees of separatist activity in Cornwall, Mercia (the West Midlands and East Midlands regions), Northumberland, Yorkshire, Jersey, and Wales, and even talk of England itself exiting the UK. However, these appear to be trite compared to the Scottish and Irish questions.Read moreLasers, spaceflight, surgery, nuclear power and the secrets of Mayan civilization: How Russian scientists changed the worldWestern Europe: Countries Within CountriesFor the most part, the countries of Western Europe seem to be exemplary unitary states, and generally that is what they are. However, there are also strong regional identities, as well as desires for more autonomy and separatist leanings.In France, for example, there is the problem of the Occitans, who occupy a huge area in the south of the country – as many as seven regions. Even an aggressive Francization policy wasn’t sufficient to solve this problem definitively: all signs in the region are regularly duplicated in Occitanian.Brittany, in the northwest of the country, also has a strong regional identity. Its inhabitants have their own Celtic language and prefer to call themselves Bretons, rather than French. In the last half of the 20th century, the Breton Liberation Front, which is the armed wing of the Breton Revolutionary Army, carried out terrorist attacks, while barking out slogans advocating independence for their homeland. In Corsica, radical groups haven’t shied away from employing violent means to achieve independence, even in this century.Each of these separatist communities boasts a political wing – the Occitan Party, the Breton Party, and the Free Corsica Party – whose programs range from demanding greater autonomy to calling for full independence. The last instance of violence occurred in the summer of last year, when the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) claimed responsibility for 16 arson attacks and took credit for bombing summer residences owned by non-Corsicans, as well as construction companies and police cars.

Bavarians are significantly different from other Germans. Their dialect is actually considered to be a separate language, if not officially recognized as such. Although regional identity is extremely strong, Bavarians rarely speak about separatism, at least publicly. But even in the absence of conflict, Berlin keeps its eye on Munich.Read moreNo quiet on the Eastern front: How the US has worked to prevent Russia and Japan from putting a formal end to World War TwoOne of Germany’s main parties, the Christian Democratic Union, whose representatives have repeatedly been selected as Germany’s Chancellor,does not contest elections in Bavaria.Instead, itworks in an alliance with the purely Bavarian Christian Social Union party, which has absorbed most of the separatist and radical nationalist Bavarian parties over time.In Italy, the issue of independence is being discussed in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. And these discussions are rather unpleasant for Rome. For example, Venetian politicians have managed to have Venetic recognized as an official language in their region, along with Italian. In March of 2014, 89% of respondents in an online poll conducted in the region supported creating a sovereign Federal Republic of Veneto. However, it hasn’t advanced to a referendum yet. The desire to achieve greater independence in these areas mainly stems from economic factors, but in South Tyrol, the national question also plays a role. This rich German-speaking region, which became part of Italy only after the First World War, has been striving to reunify with Austria for more than a century.The most likely candidate for disintegration in Western Europe is undoubtedly Belgium. It consists of two regions inhabited by very different peoples: Dutch-speaking Flemings, who make up about 60% of the country’s population, and French-speaking Walloons, who account for 40%. The linguistic division is aggravated by serious economic inequality between the regions – the Flemings have every reason to believe that their southern neighbors in Wallonia, whose unemployment rate is twice as high and GDP per capita a third lower, are living at their expense. Thirty years ago, Flanders’ dissatisfaction with this situation contributed to transforming a unified Belgium into a federation. Now the Flemings are fighting to extend their autonomy further, while the Walloons attempt to repulse their efforts.                   FILE PHOTO.

These regions include Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and eastern Ukraine.Read moreThe Fight for Ugledar: Why controlling a small town in southwestern Donbass is so important for the Russian militaryBut separatist aspirations are not confined to Europe. They can also be found in Asia, Africa, and even Oceania. This is especially true in countries with a colonial past, where borders were often drawn under external pressure without regard to local factors and the traditional homelands of tribes and peoples.The strongest non-European powers today are not without this problem either. The world is well aware of the separatist threats facing China. The United States has recently been increasingly touting claims for independence from Taiwan, Tibet, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Hong Kong, and Macau. A little more than half a century ago, Beijing was also fighting separatism in Inner Mongolia, but demographic trends have rendered this problem less relevant.That said, even the US itself, which from the outside appears to be one of the most monolithic nations in the word, could easily be divided into 11 smaller nations. Stories about Americans pushing for the independence of individual states – California and Texas, for example – pop up in the media from time to time, while more exotic movements advocating the independence of entire regions, such as Cascadia or the Republic of New Africa, also exist.At any rate, a complete list of all the separatist movements around the world would occupy a separate room in a library.                       © independent.co.uk                                                        Is there a solution?Timofey Bordachev, program director at the Valdai Club, in Moscow, believes that “Globally, separatism is a reaction to disassociation, the construction of new fences, and the rise of nationalism.”“If there was real globalization, there would be no separatism. Borders would be transparent, and people wouldn’t care where they live.Separatism is a struggle against the nationalism of the titular nation.Why do residents of Donbass and Eastern Ukraine want to get out from under Kiev’s power? The reason is Ukrainian nationalism. Why did separatists wanting to break with Georgia appear in South Ossetia and Abkhazia? Because Tbilisi tried to impose Georgian nationalism on these regions. That’s it. The reason behind separatism always stems from the nationalism of the larger nation,” the expert told RT.Read moreThe Maidan sniper killings were pivotal for the 2014 Kiev coup –why is research into the massacre being censored in the West?Nikolay Topornin, associate professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations’ Department of European Law, has a slightly different point of view. According to him, “There is no clear relation between separatist tendencies and global integration processes.”“Each case has its own history, its own characteristics, its own roots. But yes, most often a whole complex of historical, cultural, religious, linguistic, educational, and economic reasons lies behind each example of separatism,” he pointed out.In some sense, globalization has contributed to the growth of separatism, according to the expert. One of its consequences has been the appearance of glocalization, with regional differences strengthening, rather than disappearing as expected. “Instead of merging and unifying, trends in the opposite direction are emerging and gaining strength: separatist leanings, increased attention on local differences, heightened interest in ancient traditions, and the revival of dialects,” he said.Under these conditions, there are only two ways to fight separatism: repression and concessions. Countries often employ both of these methods simultaneously by persecuting separatist-minded activists, while granting separatist regions more autonomy at the same time. However, according to Timofey Bordachev, there is a more universal prescription:“Is there a theoretical solution to the problem of separatism? Yes. It’s an empire. The only prescription for separatism is an empire: large multinational, multi-confessional countries, such as Russia, China, and, to some extent, the United States.”By Georgiy Berezovsky, Vladikavkaz-based journalistFeature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571605-only-prescription-for-separatism-is-empire/,2023,2,17

However, in the spheres of global trade and big business, itrepresents a geographical location that can be exploited for international shipping and its largely untouched oil and gas reserves. The leadership in Yemen has always been of great importance, especially in the period of the Cold War, during which Western imperialist nations and their reactionary allies on the Arabian Peninsula feared the prospect of any peoples becoming allies withthe Soviet Union.To understand North Yemen’s revolution of 1962, which later morphed into a brutal civilproxy war until 1970, we first must understand the divided nations which would later join together and become a united Yemen in 1990.Yemen, meaning ‘south Arabia’ in Arabic, has historically been a geographically and culturally perspicuous territory. The uppermost region of Yemen, formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire, gained its official independence in 1918, calling itself the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. The kingdom, which was known retrospectively as North Yemen, was controlled by a monarch, Imam Yahya Mohammed, who hailed from the Zaydi-Shia Islamic sect.                   Imam Yahya Mohammed.     © Wikipedia                                                        Meanwhile, the south and east of Yemen lay under the control of the British Empire. Declared the ‘Aden Colony’ in 1937, the southernmost territory in Yemen was developed around the key port city of Aden, strategically located where the Red Sea meets the Arabian Sea. Aden was first conquered by the British East India Company in 1839 and they ruled their colony with an iron fist.Read moreAnother Afghanistan in the making? How a fully-fledged war between two ex-Soviet states could threaten stability in Central AsiaThe North Yemeni revolution erupted on September 26, 1962, when a commander of Yemen’s Royal Guard, Abdullah al-Sallal, led a number of Egyptian and Iraqi-trained officers in a popular coup d'etat to overthrow Yemen’s monarchical leadership. Al-Sallal was inspired by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was the leading voice for Arab nationalism at the time. Al-Sallal’s army of revolutionary republicans deposed the newly crowned ruler, Mohammed al-Badr, quickly seizing Yemen’s capital city, Sanaa, declaring the newly formed Yemen Arab Republic (YAR).At the time of the revolution in the north, the British governing the colony of Aden began to fear what this could mean for their then-top-secret plan to create the ‘Federation of South Arabia’, which they would later form in 1963. The British also feared the security threat such a revolution could pose to its allied regimes in the Persian Gulf, like Bahrain and Oman, where they sought after oil and the stability of the autocratic leaderships they had helped to place in power. The British could not allow an ally of Nasser, who was aligned with the Soviet Union, to become prosperous and spread the ideology of Arab nationalism even further on the Arabian Peninsula.Following the assassination of the Crown Prince of North Yemen, Imam Yahya Mohammed, in 1948, came the consequential era of his son, Imam Ahmed bin Yahya. Imam Ahmed, as he is often referred to, aspired to rule over a ‘Greater Yemen’, and his forces clashed on several occasions with the British to the south. In March 1955, Imam Ahmad survived a coup attempt and faced mounting pressure against his autocratic rule. He eventually decided in 1958 to join what became the United Arab States, a confederation with what is now Egypt and Syria, known at the time as the United Arab Republic (UAR).

It has been argued that the confederation’s breakup was a significant factor in paving the way for the 1962 civil war, as it then gave way to al-Sallal’s republicanism, which would become popular in North Yemen. The former King of Yemen, Imam Mohammed al-Badr, did not decide to cede power to his republican opponents without a fight – fleeing to Saudi Arabia and from there rallying an army of royalists that were equipped and supplied by Riyadh.Read more15 years after US Blackwater mercenaries massacred civilians in Baghdad, has anything changed for private military contractors?Yemen’s revolutionI asked Rune Agerhus, the chief coordinator at the Organization of Solidarity with the Yemeni Struggle (OSYS), how the Mutawakkilite Kingdom’s leadership was able to suddenly change and ally itself with Saudi Arabia, after formerly being an ally of Nasser.He stated: “Up until recently, to rule Yemen meant to balance yourself on the precipice of internal and external contradictions. Yemen has always prided itself on the fact that it had remained an independent kingdom for more than a thousand years up until 1962, with a long anti-colonial history against both the Roman and Ottoman empires. Despite economic and political cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom going as far back as the 1920s, the emerging multipolar world with two competing superpowers on each side meant Imam Al-Badr had to make some significant choices to remain seated in power.“The clashes that the Kingdom of Yemen had with Saudi Arabia and British forces to the south were not born out of any anti-colonial sentiment, but rather from the feeling that these two countries held territory that the Imam believed was his. “It all changed in 1962 when the very superstructures of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom and the Imam’s rule were threatened. There is also the very crucial point to be made that Yemen’s tribes have always been influenced by Saudi rule and decree, a malignant practice that has helped shape Yemen as the poorest Arab country on the planet. Saudi Arabia in turn likely promised to support Imam Al-Badr to maintain this tribal influence, and the Imam sought refuge in an unlikely ally to maintain power.”Although the US did end up supplying anti-air weapons to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in its fight against the republicans in Yemen, it fell short of playing the role, on the side of the KSA, that it does in today’s conflict against the Ansarallah government, which took over Sanaa in 2015. Instead, it was the British that played the most prominent role of any Western country, on the side of the Saudi-backed royalists. MI6, the British SAS special forces, and mercenaries were all used to fight the Arab-nationalist republican forces, led by al-Sallal, in Yemen. Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan also played a prominent role in providing weapons, intelligence, and logistical support to the Saudi-backed royalists.One of the primary reasons for the Saudi-led coalition’s backing of the royalists in the conflict was the direct involvement of Egypt on the side of the newly established Yemen Arab Republic. The USSR was the first nation to formally recognize the YAR, and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushcheveven wrote to the Yemeni Republican leader, al-Sallal, stating that“any act of aggression against Yemen will be considered an act of aggression against the Soviet Union.”                   FILE PHOTO. The Soviet leaders Nikolau Bulganin (r) and Niketa Khrushchev.     © Hulton-Deutsch CollectionCORBISCorbis via Getty Images                                                        Nasser sought to challenge Saudi Arabia, encourage the spread of Arab nationalism, and drive the British out of Yemen in order to bring the Red Sea under Arab sovereignty.Just how pivotal was the influence of external powers on the civil war? Agerhus says:“Saudi Arabia is, by many, considered to have been Yemen’s sworn enemy ever since thousands of barefooted Yemeni pilgrims were murdered by clansmen led by Al-Saud [Saudi Arabia’s ruling family] in the Tanomah valley in 1922. This marked the starting point of the long feud between the two countries. After the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the early 1930s, the Western economic bloc got itself a new ally in the region that it could trust to thwart the emergence of what was then considered ‘radical thought.’ The build-up of global and regional alliances was already taking shape prior to the revolution of 1962.“The Cold War affected the North Yemen civil war because the competing polars had vastly different viewpoints on the rights of people to self-determination and fundamentally different perceptions of the very practice of colonialism and feudalism. “Egyptian and Soviet support for Abdullah Al-Sallal's forces shaped the war to a large extent, which is evident even today as the prevailing superstructures of Yemeni society and the armed forces are and were modeled on Egyptian inspiration and armed with Soviet and Russian weaponry. I do believe the war would have been fought otherwise, but perhaps with different results without international support.”In Yemen’s British-controlled south, 1962 was also the year that pan-Arab liberation movements began to grow in size and put up a fight against British colonial rule. In October 1963, a new revolution began in the south, or what the British would come to describe as the ‘Aden emergency,’ which involved revolutionary action from a unified front of Marxist and Arab nationalist forces from the Taiz and Aden areas. This revolution was aided by the YAR, as the leading revolutionary forces in British-occupied southern Yemen came together to form the unified ‘Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen,’ which was set up under the supervision of their revolutionary comrades in Yemen’s north.

Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen.     © Wikipedia                                                        “I don’t believe there is any evidence to suggest that international assistance to the anti-colonial struggle was crucial in shaping the inevitable result,” Agerhus says. “However, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, as an institution, likely would not have been established without Soviet political and advisory support.”Read moreThe West is poised to throw Yemen under the bus again to fuel its economic war on RussiaHe went on to say that “the struggle in the south was centered on two competing but cooperating resistance factions, the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, or FLOSY for short, and the National Liberation Front. FLOSY maintained a socialist Arab nationalist political line while the NLF ascribed to Marxist ideology.”Consequences of the September 26 RevolutionBetween 1962 and 1970, at least 200,000 people had been killed in a conflict which eventually led to the inevitable; the Yemen Arab Republic was recognized as a sovereign nation and the royalists, who lacked popular support, were defeated. However, while the republicans had won the war, in the process, so too had Arab nationalism died amid the fighting in Yemen.It is often suggested that the downfall of Arab nationalism stemmed from the shocking defeat of Nasser’s Egypt during the June 1967 war, when Israel launched its offensive known as ‘Operation Focus’ and went on to defeat its Arab neighbors in onlysix days. However, without Egypt’s over-commitment to the war in Yemen, which had reached a deadly stalemate during the mid-1960s, Tel Aviv may not have possessed the confidence to have launched the Six-Day War, or at the very least Egypt would have been more prepared for the confrontation. The war in Yemen cost the Egyptians so dearly that it is often referred to as ‘Egypt’s Vietnam,’ a war in which Nasser’s army was so heavily bogged down that his home turf ended up occupied by Israel.Read moreJewel of the Caucasus: Why Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to fight over Nagorno-KarabakhIn 1967, as Nasser’s Arab nationalism was dealt a death blow, an alternative ideology emerged which the Arab world would harness to continue its fight against imperialist powers and autocratic Middle Eastern rulers. Marxist ideology, in its various forms, was the natural answer to fill the ideological void. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in Yemen; in November 1967, the Yemeni revolution in the nation’s south proved successful in forcing out the British colonialists and the revolutionary forces declared the sovereignty of South Yemen. The defeat of Egypt earlier that June had seen the Israelis seize the Sinai Peninsula, resulting in the closure of the Suez Canal supply route for the nexteight years. The closure of this strategic supply route to Europe, combined with the pressure of the ongoing revolutionary war, forced the British to leave and, only two years later, after the liberation of South Yemen, the Arab world’s first communist state was declared in 1969, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY).“I do believe that the Cold War ended up having a positive effect on Yemen’s domestic political trends,”Agerhus said when asked about the era’s impact. He explained that “the majority of Yemen’s population are peasantry, and the country has a rich and diverse political landscape with left-leaning and Islamically progressive tendencies dominating the scene. The general population also remains vocally anti-colonialist in both tone, theory and practice, which is undoubtedly a relic that persists from the Cold War.”Although the Cold War provided inspiration and an environment in which Yemenis would rise up against the tyranny of their British occupiers to the south and an autocratic regime to the north, with the decline of the Soviet Union, the lack of any solid counterbalance to Western hegemony doomed the nation. Initially, unification was thought to lead to a brighter future for Yemen as a whole, one under which the leaderships of both South and North Yemen could co-exist. However, the eventual unification of the PDRY (South Yemen) with the YAR (North Yemen), birthing the Republic of Yemen in 1990, only ended up landing the country back in the hands of an autocratic ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who would advocate and implement neo-liberal economic policies that crippled the public sector, all to appease international monetary institutions.

Yemen's ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh.     © MOHAMMED HUWAIS  AFP                                                        It has been speculated that, due to the loss of Soviet support for the PDRY and the weakness of both the economies of South and North Yemen, this was a primary factor in unification; however, when I asked Agerhus this question, he answered with the following:“I don’t believe it was a significant factor, considering that unification was already under consideration by the late 1960s. Yemen was never meant to be separated. Representatives of South Yemeni trade unionists had seats in the government of North Yemen during the Civil War. A unified socialist state was always the penultimate goal, but ideological and geopolitical complications made the achievement of unification a prolonged and complicated matter. Yemen had earlier than 1990 been close to unification. In the 1970s, North Yemen was ruled by socialist military leader Ibrahim Al-Hamdi, who sought to improve and reshape society natively without any external intervention. Although an Arab nationalist by heart, he was still left-leaning enough to find large common ground with South Yemen’s president, Salim Rubai Ali, to such an extent that by 1977, a shared elementary school curriculum had been enacted to be taught in both Yemeni nation states, and with plans to reunify the two states’ diplomatic corps. A scheduled visit to Aden in 1977 would likely have further solidified the course towards actual reunification, but was forced to a halt with Al-Hamdi murdered during a luncheonby his right-hand man, Al-Ghashmi, on October 11, a murder many consider Saudi Arabia to have orchestrated in order to regain control of the tribes, whose influence Hamdi had made great effort to curb and limit.”The Yemen we see today is a nation that was under the thumb of an autocratic ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh, for 33 years, a country that’s direction was left in the hands of Western powers following the Cold War. On the results of 1962-1970 conflict, Agerhus says:“The civil war and consequential atrophy of the public administration meant that Yemen was beyond vulnerable and even poorer than it had ever been. In theory, the September 26 revolution was a milestone achievement for Yemeni society, seeing the establishment of the Peninsula’s only Republic. In theory, the revolution would have established an Arab nationalist democratic state, but in practice, reality turned out to be different. Saudi Arabia maintained its influence on the tribes, and at one point even decided on the appointment of the country’s prime minister. This level of influence only grew stronger with Judge Al-Eriyani’s presidential term from 1967 until 1974, which saw the establishment of a special ministry of tribal affairs acting as a gateway for further Saudi entrenchment into Yemen’s public administration and society.”Robert Inlakesh isa political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK.

Ex-Nazis in the service of Uncle Sam: How the US took control of Germany’s main intelligence service — RT World News,"        Ex-Nazis in the service of Uncle Sam: How the US took control of Germany’s main intelligence service                        The history of the BND, its founder Reinhard Gehlen, and its loyal service to Washington            ©                RT“The United States still essentially occupies Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and other countries. At the same time, it cynically calls them equal allies... What kind of cooperation is that?”. This question was posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his speech in the Kremlin on September 30, 2022, when agreements on the entry of the new regions into the Russian Federation were signed.The Russian president did not go into further detail, but it's hard to argue against his words. Western Europe’s strongest country, Germany, increasingly acts against its national interests. Berlin coordinates its foreign policy course with Washington not only at regular NATO and G7 summits, but also through more private channels. One of these is Germany’s foreign intelligence service, officially called the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND).This department was created in the post-WWII years by former Nazis and SS officers as a private intelligence organization. Control over the service was entirely in the hands of the United States, and major intelligence operations were carried out in the US interest. Numerous journalistic investigations allow us to conclude that the situation has not changed much to this day.Read moreAmerica’s Neo-Nazi bedfellows in Ukraine are latest in long line of odious allies Washington has used against RussiaRT recalls the history of German intelligence as one of the most loyal tools in the hands of the United States.Officer, spy, NaziThe history of “German intelligence” is inextricably linked with its founder Reinhard Gehlen. He was born on April 3, 1902, in Erfurt, Prussia, part of the German Empire, in the family of retired Oberleutnant Walter Gehlen. The family came from the Flemish aristocracy, where men traditionally served in the army.Young Gehlen had every chance to break with family tradition – after the First World War, under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was restricted from having military educational institutions.Everything changed when Adolf Hitler came to power. Under his rule, Germany renewed its course toward militarization. One of the first steps was the restoration of military educational institutions, including the General Staff College. The future head of the BND was one of its first graduates.In 1936, Gehlen was appointed an officer of the operational department of the German army’s “South” group, under the leadership of one of the top WWII generals, Erich von Manstein. This served as a springboard for his further military career. During the Second World War, Reinhard rose to the rank of Lieutenant General and became chief of military intelligence of the Supreme Command of the German Army’s Abteilung Fremde Heere Ost (FHO). In thewar years, this structure collected large amounts of data on the technical, military, strategic and political intelligence of the Soviet Union.                   Reinhard Gehlen     © Wikipedia                                                        In fact, Gehlen owed his brilliant military career entirely to Hitler's Nazis.In 1944, however, he was already aware of the regime’s dwindling prospects. As an ardent anti-communist, he decided to join one of the Western allies willing to pay good money for his services. The head of intelligence gave orders for numerous intelligence documents to be copied and hidden in waterproof barrels. These were then buried in various locations in the Austrian Alps.Read moreThe volunteer super-spy: How a German businessman stole the newest US missile for MoscowIt didn’t take long to find a buyer. In July 1943, the military department of the US Department of Defense formed the Department of Special Projects. This organization began developing a secret program for retraining German prisoners of war.On April 5, 1945, a month before the surrender of Germany, the Lieutenant General along with his helpers, Gerhard Wessel and Hermann Bown, surrendered to the Americans, taking along Soviet-related intelligence collected during the war, and the best pro-American personnel.Shortly before that, the Chief of Staff of the US Army, George Catlett Marshall Jr., agreed to study the archives of the Wehrmacht military formations on the Eastern front. Also in April 1945, an agreement was concluded between the intelligence services of Great Britain and the United States to study the experience of conducting military operations against the USSR. Gehlen, with his data and experience, had great timing.Upon arrival in the United States, hewas given the pseudonym Hans Holbein and issued a service certificate to conceal the fact that the US army was cooperating with SS members.As a result of Gehlen's agreement with the American government, starting in mid-September 1945, prisoners of war in a camp with the postal address P.O Box 1142, Fort Hunt, Virginia, USA began research work under his guidance. The project was code-named ""B"" (Bolero).Read moreOperation Uranus: The day Hitler’s Nazis were smashed and the Soviet Union began to take the upper hand in WW2The Nazi theme clubAccording to information obtained from CIA archives, about 200 officers took part in the schemefrom October 1945 to April 1946. The result of their work was a document numbering 3,657 pages, prepared for the governments of the United Kingdom, the US, and Canada.In July 1946, Gehlen's Bolero group was merged with another intelligence unit composed of former Nazis. This was Keystone, a service monitoring radio transmission on USSR-controlled European territory. It was headed by Herman Baun and located in Oberursel, Germany. The joint operation of these two groups was code-named Rusty, and their main task was to collect intelligence about the state of the USSR's armed forces on European territories under its control.A few months later, Gehlen and the USgovernment agreed to create a full-fledged spy agency called The Gehlen Organization. He himselfheaded the organization, remaining its permanent leader until its abolition.Some of the first people Gehlen recruited were SS and Gestapo officers who were issued false names and forged documents.The CIA’s declassified archives have a dossier on one of the staff members, Heina Paul Johannes, who served in SS units and joined the organization under the name Karl Schuetz.Among the first to join were SS-Obersturmfuhrers Frans Goring and Hans Sommer, and SS-Sturmfuhrer Herbert Stein.

Colonel Heinz Heer became the chief analyst; Colonel Ulrich Noack headed the research group on the USSR economy; Captain Blossfeldt led the interrogations.The agents providing information to the organization consisted entirely of pro-Hitlercitizens who participated in active hostilities during World War II on the side of Nazi Germany.Read more‘All the real skinheads went to Ukraine’: An American Neo-Nazi outlines the crimes of his Ukrainian ‘colleagues’New activities of the former NazisOfficial registration data for The Gehlen Organization is missing for obvious reasons. We only know that it operated under different names: from 1949 to 1950 under the code name “Offspring”, from 1950 to 1951 as “Odeum”, and from 1951 to 1956 as “Zipper”.The main activity of the organization was to obtain intelligence in the countries of Eastern Europe and the USSR.On April 1, 1946, the new organization’s trial operations began and subsequently received a positive assessment from US representatives.However, The Gehlen Organization's first major operation was launched in 1947 and code-named “Aktion Hermes.” Its goal was to systematically interrogate hundreds of thousands of former German prisoners of war, who were beginning to return from Sovietcamps where they were forced to participate in rebuilding the country.The organization's agents held permanent positions in the repatriation camps of Western zones, and then in Germany. Almost every repatriate – both soldier and civilian – was contacted by agents who asked him about where they wereheld and the factories where they worked. The agents were primarily interested in spies from the other side.The main topics were the Soviet industry, armaments, telecommunications, and the population’s attitude toward the government.

The operation was led by Henry Carr, director of the North European Department of MI6, and the head of the Baltic Branch, Alexander McKibbin.Read more'We lived in dread of war, they told us we'd be dead in less than 30 minutes': How the world survived the Cuban Missile CrisisThe Gehlen Organization was tasked with selecting agents for the operation from among former Nazis.Agents were transported to the Baltic States by sea under the cover of fictitious maritime transport company British Baltic Fishery Protection Service, which operated on a wartime high-speed military boat.Officially, the company was engaged in protecting West German fishermen from “Soviet arbitrariness” at sea. The boats were modified (with weights reduced to increase speed).To hide the British government’s involvement in case the boat was seized by the Soviet Navy, and the Gehlen Organization provided it with a German crew.However, the USSR's Ministry of State Security (MGB) was notified of the operation through its agents in Britain, and almost all of the 42 “Jungle” agents were arrested.A celebration at whose expense?In his memoirs, Gehlen wrote: “Until 1956, we did not have the opportunity to cover employees with state insurance, since formally, the employer did not exist.”At the initial stage of The Gehlen Organization, Washington used it as a cell of its own army. It was the US army that took on the task of equipping the group of Nazi intelligence officers with technical tools ranging from typewriters to the necessary radio equipment.The newly created institution was funded exclusively from the US budget, and the number of funds allocated, according to reports from various sources, ranged from $1.5 million to $3.4 million per year for 50 employees.

What the US army provided was not enough, and the “black market” became its main source of income. The system was equally effective and shameless. The army provided the organization with money for supplies, which the organization's special teams sold on the “black market”. Following the deals, the Criminal Affairs Division of the US Army confiscated the goods on the grounds that they had illegally entered the ""black market"", and again took them into its property, which then again ended up on the ""black market"". After the currency reform in June 1948, when the new German mark was introduced, this profitable cycle became a question of survival. According to Gehlen, its purchasing power then decreased by 70 percent.”In 1949, The Gehlen Organization became subordinate to the CIA and remained under its control until Germany established its own government, for which the organization proceeded to work.Among the documents found in CIA archives was the organization’s payroll. At the time, the salary of each employee ranged from 500 to 900 US dollars.From the early 1950s, the German economy financed the institution through an agency code-named the “Industrial Research Institute”.

The money also came from the Federal Chancellor's Reptilienfonds.Read moreDead Hand’s nuclear revenge: What would happen if the West launched an attack on Russia?The birth of the German intelligence serviceIn June 1950, Gehlen expressed his views in favor of creating a West German foreign intelligence service to Hans Globke, the Secretary of State in the office of the Federal Chancellor, and in September of the same year, he spoke to the Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer himself.His views eventually found support due to the changing situation in international politics.In June 1950, the Korean War began, which made it clear that the “Cold War” could turn into real combat at any moment.In divided Germany, two opposing social systems – communism and capitalism– stood literally opposite each other. The new war in Asia emphasized the vital need to collect information about the enemy and determined the course of intelligence priorities.The conjuncture was on the side of military espionage – primarily against troops in Eastern Germany (""short-range intelligence""), as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern Bloc countries, including Yugoslavia and Albania (""deep intelligence"") and in the Soviet Union itself (""long-range intelligence"").                   1950 Soviet stamp, depicting the flags and peoples of communist states, including those of Eastern Europe.     © Wikipedia                                                        Intensive efforts to include The Gehlen Organization in the structure of the Federal Government and thus ensure its budgetary financing were crowned with success five years later, when on July 11, 1955, the Cabinet of Ministers finally decided to take control of the organization and subordinate it to the Office of the Federal Chancellor.Less than a year later, on April 1, 1956, The Gehlen Organization was finally transformed into the BND, but its structure had not changed in any way. Gehlen himself remained the permanent head of intelligence for another 12 years.Read moreHow the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has managed to unite Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian elites in collective angerThere are no official figures or scientifically based independent data on how the number of BND employees changed since 1956. According to opinion generally accepted in the GDR, the number of employees doubled from 1,245 people in 1956 to 2,500 in 1963, then doubled again to five thousand in 1968, and in 1977 the BND employed 6,500 officials, employees, workers, and officers sent from the Bundeswehr.Old habits under a new statusAlthough the BND formally became the sovereign intelligence service of a formally sovereign state, it continued to carry out tasks in the interests of the US government.This is confirmed by an investigation of The Washington Post and the German channel ZDF.The investigation references the documents of the CIA and the BND and states that for half a century from the 1950s onwards, the CIA in conjunction with the BND read the secret correspondence of the governments of 120 countries, receiving multimillion-dollar financial profits out of it. This was carried out through the Swiss firm Crypto AG, which produces encryption equipment.There is much to suggestthat the German intelligence agency continues to carry out its activities in the interests of the United States to this day.For example, in 2015, the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, referencing an electronic statement of the BND, reported that, by order of the US National Security Agency (NSA), the German intelligence organization collected information about Austria, using keywords such as bundesamt (federal agency), gov (government), diplo (diplomatic institutions, Foreign Ministry).The publication had previously reported that the BND helped the National Security Agency to carry out espionage against members of the French government and the European Commission.The intelligence service of any country is a sign of its sovereignty and a tool for solving state tasks subordinated to national interests.Proceeding from the above, as well as from the history of such a strategically important agency as the BND, it may be reasonable toconclude that Germany is not fully sovereign at the moment.By‘R-Techno’,private intelligence companyFeature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/567533-ex-nazis-in-service-of-us/,2022,12,12

The sources expect the Biden administration’s decision will depend on whether Riyadh manages to get any closer towards ending its years-long war in Yemen in a political settlement, according to the report.Additionally, the White House is approaching the matter with utmost caution, since the Saudi-led coalition is reported to have used US-made weapons against civilian targets, the sources said. Back in January, Amnesty International reported that the coalition used American precision-guided munitions in an airstrike on a detention center in Yemen, killing dozens of people.: Biden attempts to justify Saudi Arabia tripSaudi officials have been trying to get the ban lifted for months now, putting pressure at any opportunity on their American counterparts to reverse the decision, the sources revealed. But it wasn’t until Saturday that Biden, who had previously called Saudi Arabia a “pariah” state, made clear his intention to “reset” the US’ strained relations with its Gulf partner, in part to secure an increase in oil production that could help bring gas prices down.“I know that there are many who disagree with my decision to travel to Saudi Arabia,” Biden wrote in a commentary published by the Washington Post. However, the visit will help to start “a new and more promising chapter of America’s engagement” in the Middle East – and “a more secure and integrated Middle East” is essential to Americans, since its energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact of Russia’s offensive in Ukraine, the president argued.Biden’s commentary followed his administration’s attempts to get US’ Middle-Eastern partners to help alleviate what Washington keeps calling “Putin’s price hike.” Back in March, leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly snubbed Biden’s phone calls as he was expected to urge them to ramp up oil production.: US-Saudi relations nearing ‘breaking point’ – mediaAny attempts to reverse the ban on offensive arms sales to the Saudis are certain to encounter opposition from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, Reuters reports, citing congressional aides.Biden adopted a tougher Saudi policy soon after his inauguration, aiming to punish Riyadh for a number of human rights violations, including heavy civilian casualties in its war against Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well the assassination of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. However, he softened his stance this year after sanctions, imposed on Moscow over its operation in neighboring Ukraine, backfired heavily, contributing to soaring inflation and energy prices in the US.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman explained the policy was meant to discourage migrants from making the dangerous crossing, adding the government ultimately hopes to make similar deals with other countries to reroute all illegal immigrants elsewhere.She has called the 40,000-plus migrants crossing the English Channel this year an “invasion” and vowed to ban anyone who “jumps the queue” in this way from remaining in the UK.The UK and Rwanda inked the £140 million migration deal in April, though the first scheduled deportation flight carrying eight migrants was postponed as the planewaited to take off in June, with the European Court for Human Rights insisting the policy involved “a real risk of irreversible harm.”The groups who challenged the policy are expected to appeal Monday’s decision. “Treating people who are in search of safety like human cargo and shipping them off to another country is a cruel policy that will cause great human suffering,” Ever Solomon, head of the Refugee Council, said in a statement on Monday. Opponents of the policy have cited Rwanda’s poor human rights record, including the infamous 1994 genocide that saw 800,000 people slaughtered.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (L). © Getty Images  Kenzaburo Fukuhara China and New Zealand this week completedthe ratification of their upgraded free-trade agreement, which will come into force in April. Although the deal was a long time in the works, it expands the number of tariff-free goods New Zealand is able to export into China, securing what is its largest market and a key source of income for its farmers.The agreement comes despite the growing tensions between Beijing, the United States and its allies, with Washington seeking to put the brakes on China’s expanding economic ties with its allies, in a view towards strategic containment.This has led to claims that New Zealand, a member of the Five Eyes Anglosphere intelligence alliance involving Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, has not been sufficiently ‘loyal’ to their agenda. Jacinda Ardern's more cautious approach towards Beijing, as opposed to the absolutely relentless hostility to China seen in neighboring Australia, has seen her country mocked as ‘New Xi-land.’So why is New Zealand acting differently to its partners when it comes to Beijing? And will the pressure to get it to take America’s side succeed?New Zealand, for many reasons, is a country which is fundamentally different from the other Anglosphere nations; its world outlook is more moderate, less elitist and more progressive. While the other three countries, Australia, Canada and the United States, were once British colonies established through the near total, unapologetic destruction of indigenous inhabitants in the name of Anglo-Protestant settler supremacy, New Zealand was established as more of a compromise between the British and the native Māori population. The Maori were not entirely displaced, but instead remained a cultural and political force within the country.Read moreThe trade battleground where China can deliver a serious blow to the USIn recent years, Maori culture has in fact been on the ascendency in New Zealand and unlike its Anglophone counterparts, the nation’s broader identity has absorbed it. This means that in foreign relations, New Zealand is less inclined towards the zealous imperialist and supremacist mindset seen in Washington, Canberra, London and Ottawa.Wellington is considerably more peaceful and less contentious in its outlook, which in turn influences its attitude towards Beijing. As a nation of just five million people which relies significantly on agricultural exports, China’s market of 1.4 billion hungry mouths represents a trade bonanza that is simply not matched anywhere else in the world. Why, in such circumstances, should New Zealand subscribe to an aggressive anti-China agenda?Yet for all intents and purposes New Zealand does, on paper, effectively take a side as part of the US-led security order in the Pacific, even if it is not considered a leading player or part of concentrated groups such as ‘The Quad’ strategic security grouping of the United States, India, Japan and Australia.Whilst British and Australian media outlets are quick to accuse Ardern's New Zealand of being subservient to China owing to trade, this is misleading. One may note that New Zealand has banned Huawei from its 5G networks, that it still engages in naval military drills against China in areas such as the South China Sea, still puts its name to anti-China statements pursued at the United Nations and elsewhere, and so on. But, significantly, this is done in a non-aggressive, discrete and non-confrontational way.It might be said that Wellington ‘follows’ the US agenda in its own moderate way, but does not attempt to lead or put its head above the pack needlessly. For example, New Zealand has somewhat embraced the Xinjiang-focused human rights discourse, but has notably avoided the ‘genocide’ accusation as pushed by the most aggressive Anglosphere politicians. Likewise, when the AUKUS deal to provide nuclear submarines for Australia was declared last year, Ardern announced such subs would be banned from its waters as part of its anti-nuclear stance.These distinctions remind us that New Zealand’s foreign policy is not ‘pro-China’ as such, but a careful balancing act not to frame itself as an explicit enemy to Beijing in the way Australia has done, a move that resulted in China banning numerous exports from that country throughout 2020 and 2021. New Zealand, were it to follow suit, arguably has far more to lose as a much smaller nation.Yet this also alludes to the underlying reality: that Wellington is part of an economic order which increasingly revolves around China, albeit while simultaneously being part of the US-led security order. Whilst these conflicting modes of existence have caused more discomfort in Australia, owing to its much stronger sense of Anglophone exceptionalism and historical embrace of ‘yellow peril’ rhetoric, New Zealand seems to be deftly riding out the balance.Read moreChina isn’t stealing American jobs, it’s just created 400,000 of them in BostonThe upgraded trade agreement with Beijing illustrates this existence isn’t going to change anytime soon. Wellington is also part of the 15-member Asia-Pacific Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that also incorporates China and commenced this year.While talk of diversification in international trade is often thrown around, this is superficial and easier said than done, for there are no other markets the size of China’s. This is something that the US and some of its closer allies have been unwilling to face: Beijing is and will continue to be the economic heart of an entire region by the realities of size, geography and economics. No amount of denial can change that, however much America wishes it, as set outin its “Indo-Pacific” strategy.This might mark one final distinction between Wellington and the rest of the Five Eyes states. Whilst the others are in denial, hostile towards a changing world where China is rising, and frantically trying to assemble strategies based on nostalgia or past glories, New Zealand, while still technically on their side, is more pragmatic and realistic about it all.

Is it time to dissolve the British Commonwealth? — RT World News,"        Is it time to dissolve the British Commonwealth?                        The imperialist construct is an anachronism built on neocolonial skullduggery            By Dr. Mathew Maavak, a Malaysian expert on risk foresight and governance.By Dr. Mathew Maavak, a Malaysian expert on risk foresight and governance.@MathewMaavak@MaavakVisitors walk past a portrait of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II placed in front of heritage landmark Victoria Memorial to mark the funeral of the late queen in Kolkata, India, Monday, Sept. 19, 2022. ©                AP PhotoBikas DasUpon the accession of Charles III as King of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms, questions have emerged over the continued relevance of the wider Commonwealth of Nations headed by the British monarch. The Commonwealth is a grouping of 56 nations, with a total combined population of 2.2 billion people. Among these nations, only Australia, New Zealand and Canada enjoy a special relationship with the UK, through the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (which also includes the United States).Commonwealth membership benefits for the most part are pretty much nonexistent. This begs the question of why an aspiring superpower like India would demean itself by remaining in a colonially-defined international compact. A quick glance at the Commonwealth map will reveal a scattered morass of mediocrity, inequality andor poverty.Some may rebut this observation by citing Singapore as a stellar example of a successful ex-British colony. In that case, name one world-class product, scientist, intellectual, chess grandmaster, musician or writer from that nation? Or a comedian, for that matter? Now, compare Singapore to Israel, with whom the former is often linked. There is absolutely no comparison in any field. Israel is light years ahead in terms of science, technology, music, arts and even urban agriculture. If one needs other comparative examples, repeat this juxtaposition with other small nations such as the Netherlands and Denmark. Singapore thrives as Southeast Asia’s hub – and nothing more – and its wheels are constantly greased by a perennial supply of foreign talent and capital. Ironically, this infusion has led to a yearly brain drain from among its native-born population. But no one denies that Singapore is a well-run city-state known for its efficient government machinery; one that also keeps the public discourse and dissent in permanent check.Read moreQueen Elizabeth II was the last vestige of Britain's greatnessThe colonial criteria for Commonwealth membership also provokes the neutral observer to wonder whether “national independence” was nothing more than a shambolic passing of batons from foreign overlords to a pliant local management. If there is any merit to this line of thinking, then the local management will predictably ensure that their nation may never emerge as another Japan, South Korea or Taiwan. Industries from these nations have obliterated once-dominant British brands. Coincidentally, these technological powerhouses were never colonized by Britain. South Korea and Taiwan had incidentally suffered under the Japanese yoke but their rebound from colonial oppression was simply spectacular.Tawdry Colonial LegacyThere are several sociopolitical malaises bedeviling the British Commonwealth today. These include intellectual timidity due to mass censorship, suppression of native talent; lack of national cohesion, a corrupt judicial system, and politics of mass distraction. High-value developmental initiatives in these nations have historically been nipped in the bud by Commonwealth agencies and pseudo-nationalist political parties that were planted by the British. The net result has been gross national underperformance.As a well-informed formed Indian diplomat put it, when Britain granted ‘independence’ to these colonies, they made sure that only British assets were placed in positions of authority, and anti-British hissy fits were occasionally engineered to allay suspicions whenever and wherever they emerged. Despite the apparent vitriol, the children of such politicians often ended up in British universities and enjoyed London’s patronage. This neocolonial cycle would repeat itself at the expense of national development.To borrow elements from George Orwell’s Animal Farm, why should an orangutan – who, contrary to the natural order, and upon whom millions of pounds were spent on its Oxbridge credentials and political ascendancy – be willing to nurture a formidable intelligentsia in its domain? If it ever does so, it may be challenged over the validity of eternal white elephant projects and an unending stream of worthless policy papers which often benefit British geoeconomic interests. This is where the “politics of mass distraction” come into play, leading naturally to another Commonwealth malaise, “lack of social cohesion.” Many Commonwealth states are hopelessly mired in deep ethnoreligious clefts, thanks to Britain’s divide-and-conquer policy. Another colonial legacy, corrupt judicial systems, bind the whole racket together. The never-ending child sex trafficking scandals, involving those in positions of authority in Britain, Canadaand Australia, epitomize the wider Commonwealth malaise.As for membership benefits, consider the billions in British scholarship funds that were spent on tens of thousands of Commonwealth students since 1945. How many Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences has this magnanimity produced? How many game-changing patents, innovations, platinum records or best-selling texts?Read moreCharles III becomes new British monarchBritain’s “human capital policy” in its domains arguably took a turn for the worse after the formation of the Indian National Congress (aka Congress Party) in 1885 by a colonial administrator named Allan Octavian Hume. The Congress was originally envisioned to be a consultative platform for gentlemanly colonial authorities of “good breeding” and gentlemanly Indians of “good breeding” and education. To the horror of the British establishment however, the unruly Indians rapidly discarded their colonial trappings to demand outright independence.The British responded swiftly and with trademark brutality, entailing decades of mass incarcerations, enforced famines, and mass murders like the Jalianwalla Bagh massacre. After all, this was the era of British racial supremacists such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Rudyard Kipling. Chamberlain was once described as “Hitler’s John the Baptist” while Kipling’s swastika-stamped Jungle Book was much-beloved by the Nazi party. Here is where the colonial orangutan analogy comes into play once again.Colonial hostility towards the Indian independence movement was accompanied by a skillfully-executed divide-and-conquer strategy that pitted Muslims against Hindus, ultimately leading to the partition of India. The ongoing Hindu-Muslim riots in Leceister, UK, is a legacy of that strategy. A similar game was played out in the Levant, pitting Arabs against their Jewish neighbors. Historians rarely investigate the underlying denominator between the 1921 Mappila Rebellion in India and the 1929 Hebron Massacre. But, then again, the mainstream narrative was hijacked long before any of us were born.London would never repeat the same mistake it made with the Indian National Congress. There would be no more cultivation of the best and brightest in its realms. A new generation of Indian leaders would be cultivated; ones hooked on the giddy fantasies of Fabian socialism, sleazy nepotism, and the wonders of petty bureaucracy. When India gained independence in 1947, a vacant chair was reserved at cabinet meetings for the ghost of Harold Laski – the father of Fabian socialism. The other chairs were occupied by his proteges and sympathizers. Louis Mountbatten, Britain’s last viceroy to India, and an alleged pedophile, was appointed as the newly-independent nation’s first Governor-General.But one should not fall into the trap of singling out India as an example of colonial masochism. It continues to have its fair share of genuine nationalists, the freest press in the Commonwealth (freer than even Britain), a commitment to geopolitical multipolarity and publicly-available records, and debates on the path to independence. Records of this sort do not exist elsewhere in the British Commonwealth. Furthermore, the Bombay High Court is the only entity of its kind to have served legal notice to Bill Gates over an alleged vaccine death caused by his “philanthropic” activities in India.Read moreFree speech campaigners defend anti-monarchy protestsCui Bono?Of course, if the Commonwealth shows any sign of breaking up prematurely, a few symbolic shadow plays can be arranged. The Koh-i-Noor diamond, for example, could be returned to India as a magisterial gesture from Charles III. Imagine the euphoria in New Delhi? But if Indians need some real inspiration for the period of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity that would await them, they only need to look southwards to Sri Lanka. When its economy crumpled, Sri Lankans banded together to tar and feather politicians who had sold out their nation. This show of unity is simply remarkable, especially when one considers the 25-year-long Sri Lankan civil war that only ended as recently as 2009. Contrast this to the ongoing, dehumanizing food fights in Pakistan even as its citizens rally around British-linked politicians who have given them nothing but porky pies. The mayhem witnessed in Pakistan will likely be repeated across the Commonwealth in the months and years to come.The misnomer called the Commonwealth was built on enslavement, exploitation and bloodshed. Divisions festered by colonial rule have yet to heal. Yet, power structures in the Commonwealth need their British deep state lifelines now more than ever. But how will Charles III treat the increasing irrelevance of this fossil construct? Being a proponent of population control and centralized world government, he may use his position as head of the Commonwealth to integrate his floundering subject nations into the Great Reset agenda of the World Economic Forum. After all, the internal preconditions for this transition were established decades ago.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/563287-british-commonwealth-queen-imperialism/,2022,9,22

She said that the UK government should communicate with the US authorities to end the extradition request, which was filed in 2019.Video: Protesters surrounded the UK parliament on Saturday in a historic first, with a show of support for publisher Julian Assange and one clear message: Free Julian Assange! | [video by @jjjj86] #FreeAssangeNOW#SurroundParliamentpic.twitter.comgRAv7B4scb— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 8, 2022“It’s already gone on for three-and-a-half years.

Activists gathered in front of the Justice Department building, where they called on the government to drop its extradition bid, arguing that Assange would not be treated fairly by the judiciary.Assange has effectively been in confinement since 2012, when he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, seeking to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced sexual assault charges, which have since been dropped. In 2019, Ecuador revoked Assange’s asylum status, after which he was transferred to the maximum-security Belmarsh Prison, where he has remained ever since.:    Assange files appeal against US extraditionA British court initially refused to surrender Assange to the US, citing fears that he would be subjected to inhumane treatment. Later, Washington managed to convince the British judges that the journalist’s rights would be respected, which prompted the UK to greenlight the extradition in mid-June. Since then, according to media reports, Assange’s legal team has filed two appeals to fight the decision.Assange has been a target for the US since 2010, when WikiLeaks released a trove of classified documents that depicted alleged war crimes committed by US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has since been accused of conspiring to hack Pentagon computers and is charged under America’s Espionage Act over the publication of classified materials.

SyversonUS president Joe Biden's administration has dismissed multiple media reports claiming that he has decided to greenlight a massive Alaskan oil development that climate activist Al Gore has decried as “recklessly irresponsible.”“No final decisions have been made,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday, adding that “anyone who says there has been a final decision is wrong.” She made her comments after the New York Times, Bloomberg, and CNN reported that Biden’s administration will announce approval of the Willow oil project in the Alaskan Arctic next week.The $8 billion development, announced by ConocoPhillips in January 2017, would produce an estimated 180,000 barrels a day of oil at its peak, boosting US energy supplies and extending the viability of an 800-mile pipeline that transports crude from Alaska’s North Slope. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline can carry no less than about 300,000 barrels a day during winter months. North Slope output slid to as low as 403,000 barrels a day last year, down from its 1980s peak of nearly 2 million barrels a day, according to government data.: Biden breaks campaign promiseWillow also might help ensure the economic wellbeing of Alaska, which relies on oil for around 36% of its GDP and 85% of state revenue. However, Biden will likely face heavy backlash within his own party if he approves the project because it’s located in Alaska’s pristine National Petroleum Reserve, the nation’s largest stretch of undisturbed public land.“We don’t need to prop up the fossil fuel industry with new, multi-year projects that are a recipe for climate chaos,” Gore told the UK’s Guardian newspaper on Friday. “Instead, we must end the expansion of oil, gas and coal and embrace the abundant climate solutions at our fingertips.” The former US vice president has reportedly amassed a $330 million fortune and takes a $2 million monthly salary from a climate-focused investment firm.According to media reports, Biden’s Interior Department will announce approval of the Willow project in the next few days. Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, confirmed that a decision is “imminent.” She and other lawmakers from the state met with Biden earlier this month to lobby for the ConocoPhillips development.:    Alaska won’t let Biden stop its oil boomBiden pledged during his 2020 presidential campaign to end new oil and natural gas drilling on federal lands and speed the transition away from fossil fuels.

Finland, which pressured Germany to approve exports of Leopard 2 tanks, may only be able to send “a few” of its own – and most likely not until it formally joins the US-led military bloc.This has left Berlin as the only major supplier of tanks to Kiev, something Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been keen to avoid, the Journal noted.There are more than 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks in the stocks of various European NATO armies, but only Berlin and Warsaw have committed to sending any. Germany and Poland have promised about 14 apiece. Warsaw will also throw in 60 of its modified T-72s, while Berlin is buying up almost 190 decommissioned Leopard 1s for refurbishment, some of which may need to be cannibalized for parts.In a December interview, Ukraine’s top general asked for 300 tanks right away. Canada has promised four tanks, while Portugal wants to send three.“The fact that there are so few operational battle tanks and that they are so incompatible with each other should be taken as an alarm signal in Europe,” Nico Lange, a former German defense official who is now a senior fellow at the Munich Security Conference, told the Journal.Read moreRussia cautions against Western warplanes for KievThe Netherlands and Denmark will not send any of their tanks, but agreed to help Germany fund the purchase and refurbishment of around 100 older Leopard 1 models, which were retired 20 years ago and are currently in various states of disrepair.Denmark only has 44 Leopards and the Dutch operate 18 that are on lease from Germany, noted Minna Alander of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Finland faces a different “limitation” due to its own need to protect the country’s long border with Russia, she added.Finland will be “part of the Leopard 2 cooperation in some way,” an anonymous senior official told the Journal, but declined to give any details. Helsinki has “signaled” it would “most likely” avoid tank deliveries until it officially joins NATO, according to a senior bloc official, likewise unnamed. Even then, it may only be able to spare a few of its 240 operational tanks.The UK has promised 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks, saying they ought to be delivered by the end of March.

It was said that Sunak will pay for the upgrade from his own pocket, with costs estimated at “tens of thousands of pounds.”Sunak reportedly bought the estate in 2015 for £1.5 million ($1.8 million).

About 50% of the organizations covered in the survey also said that if demand increased, they would be forced to cut the volume of assistance or to refuse some applicants altogether.The document attributed these developments mainly to increases in the cost of living. These have been spurred by skyrocketing inflation and soaring energy prices, exacerbated by the sanctions the West imposed on Russia over the Ukraine conflict. Other reasons include inadequate wages and the waiting time needed to receive a first social security payment from authorities, as well as benefit deductions.Read moreBritons facing ‘permanent’ reduction in living standards – reportWarning that the current situation is ""unsustainable,"" IFAN urged the UK government to increase social security assistance to match the rising day-to-day costs, and to eliminate the five-week waiting period to receive a first social security check.While in recent months inflation in the UK has somewhat eased up, as of January it still amounted to 10.1%.

Isla Bryson’s case has garnered widespread media attention in the UK, with critics questioning the rationale behind the inmate’s placement.On Thursday, several British media outlets published excerpts of the SPS urgent review, which has not been released in full yet. SPS chief executive Teresa Medhurst argued it was “not necessary” to do so due to the level of personal information the report contains.However, the parts that have been made public indicate that the SPS believes that “at no time during this period was any woman in SPS care at risk of harm as a consequence of the management” of Bryson.Officials also emphasized that the transgender inmate did not come into contact with any other women during her time at the Cornton Vale facility.: Scottish govt does U-turn on trans prisonersThe review did point out, however, that there are several areas regarding the management of transgender prisoners that require improvements.For instance, it is recommended that communication within the justice sector be enhanced and that a “shared justice process” for the admission of transgender people into prisons be established.The review was launched by Scotland’s Justice Secretary Keith Brown last month in response to widespread public criticism of Bryson’s placement in an all-female prison.The transgender convict at the center of the story is awaiting sentencing later this month for raping two women while she was still a man named Adam Graham.Following the public outcry, Scottish authorities did move Bryson to a male prison last month.In addition, a broader SPS Gender Identity and Gender Reassignment (GIGR) Policy Review was initiated.Until it is completed, any transgender inmate, who has acted violently toward women in the past, will not be placed in a female penitentiary. Additionally, newly convicted or remanded transgender prisoners will be held in a prison that aligns with their gender at birth.

The GSFA claims to represent some 75% of Anglicans worldwide.“We pray that our withdrawal of support for him to lead the whole communion is received by him as an admonishment in love,” the press statement read.The GSFA also claimed that through its actions, the Church of England had “departed from the historic faith” and disqualified itself as the “mother church” of the Anglican communion. The archbishops who signed the statement insisted that the decision by churches in the UK, the US, and New Zealand to allow same-sex marriage or blessings had “taken the path of false teaching.”“This breaks our hearts and we pray for the revisionist provinces to return to ‘the faith once delivered’ and to us,” the GSFA Primates wrote, adding that “we do not accept the view that we can still ‘walk together’ with the revisionist provinces.”Read moreArchbishop pressured over same-sex marriage – mediaOn February 9, the two leaders of the Church of England, Archbishop Welby and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, announced the decision by the General Synod to “publicly, unreservedly, and joyfully welcome same-sex couples in church.” It was also stated that clergy would be allowed to conduct blessing ceremonies for same-sex couples who are already married or are in a civil union.The decision, however, fueled the heated disputes within the church. Progressives were angered by the move, claiming that it did not go far enough to offer full equality and allow same-sex marriages. Conservatives, on the other hand, argued that holy matrimony should be reserved for a union between a man and a woman.

But despite a temporary relaxation of restrictions on the war-torn and shaken country, problems still exist.Syrian provinces have still been left ill-prepared to deal with the scale of disaster that has befallen them and must now be given every support to reconstruct their country. According to authorities in Turkey and Syria, as many as 42,000 people have been killed by the devastating quakes, with at least 23 million people affected in total. Millions have been temporarily displaced, and many more still await news on their loved ones and whether or not they survived. The situation as it stands is an utter disaster, and the full impact is impossible to convey in mere words.In Türkiye’s case, the international community’s response was unanimous; aid was pledged, teams arrived to relieve the suffering and, whatever the political frictions between Istanbul and some Western nations, a sense of universal humanitarian comradery prevailed. The Biden administration in Washington reacted to the natural disaster by pledging “anything” that Ankara needed, while the European Union mobilized emergency response and offered its Copernicus satellite mapping service to help first responders in Türkiye.However, the situation has been very different for Syria with only a few select nations quick to come to its aid. The US government stated that it would not cooperate with Damascus to deal with the carnage inside Syrian territory. The Syrian government officially requested help from the EU, which some EU states instantly refused to provide. The United Kingdom quickly came to the aid of their NATO ally Türkiye, but refused help to the suffering Syrians, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky tweeted his condolences to Türkiye and its people in Turkish but failed to acknowledge Syria at all. Syrians were not in the spotlight to receive help from the West and are actively being ignored in spite of the gravity of the situation facing them.Read moreWestern sanctions will mean that more Syrians die after the earthquakesCompounding the difficulties is a plethora of sanctions against the Damascus government, which were applied by the EU, the UK and the US. The worst of these are perhaps the 2019 Caesar Act sanctions, which have severely crippled Syria’s post-war economy and robbed the nation of the ability to reconstruct.The US sanctions have indeed been amended for a short period, to allow relief aid to travel into Syria, but the problem with the sanctions is not just that they hindered aid from entering the country for days.The dire economic situation across Syria’s provinces, a problem preceding the current crisis, has undermined the medical sector’s capacity to deal with the sheer number of dead and injured following an earthquake of this magnitude. According to a number of UN experts, the sanctions imposed upon Syria were already causing a humanitarian crisis and should be lifted.“With more than half of the vital infrastructure either completely destroyed or severely damaged, the imposition of unilateral sanctions on key economic sectors, including oil, gas, electricity, trade, construction and engineering have quashed national income, and undermine efforts towards economic recovery and reconstruction,” Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on unilateral coercive measures and human rights, said last year.The UN has directly linked Syria’s current cholera epidemic to Western sanctions, which have prevented rehabilitation and development of water distribution networks at a time when 12 million Syrians grapple with food insecurity.According to on-the-ground accounts, during the first few days following the earthquake, there was not enough fuel to transport aid and rescue teams to affected areas quickly. In Syrian government-held areas, electricity only runs for a few hours per day under normal circumstances. Now, given the masses of displaced families, people are suffering in sub-zero temperatures at night.Exacerbating the issues is that while Syria is rich in natural gas and oil, the US military, along with its proxy forces in the northeast of the country, occupies a third of Syria’s territory, including its oil and gas fields. The most fertile agricultural lands have also been stolen from the Syrian people by US occupation, which was never granted congressional approval back in Washington. Piling onto that pressure, Israel also used the earthquake as an opportunity to claim that the Syrian government had requested aid from it, knowing this would reflect poorly on Damascus. The Syrian government denies this, and although Israel claims the aid would be directed to Syria, it was only sent to Türkiye.Read moreEconomic toll of Türkiye earthquakes estimatedThat the US State Department amended its sanctions is a tacit admission that they had prevented aid reaching Syria and that Washington is cognizant of this fact. Efforts to deny that sanctions impeded foreign nations from sending aid to those suffering, for example in The Washington Post are deceptive and done in poor faith.According to Aron Lund, a fellow with the New York-based think tank Century International, although the sanctions do not technically forbid aid, the reality on the ground is something completely different. Banks often block transfers that are supposed to pay suppliers or local aid workers for fear of breaking sanctions rules, Lund observed, as quoted by the Associated Press. Additionally, the sanctions actually target reconstruction inside Syria, which means that they will block rebuilding efforts, whether the destruction resulted from the 12-year-long war or from the earthquake.Out of Syria’s four primary border crossings, for years only the Bab al-Hawa crossing into the Idlib province was given a mandate by the UN for delivering aid to Syria. Idlib is controlled jointly between Turkish forces in the north and al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whereas the Syrian government does not have direct territorial access to the crossing and most countries refuse to use the Damascus International Airport to send aid.On top of this, the sole border crossing was severely damaged by the earthquake, depriving roughly 4 million Syrians of aid they depend on. Recently, Syrian President Bashar Assad offered support to civilians living inside the Idlib province, help that was rejected by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Syrian leader also permitted the opening of two additional crossings into Idlib, a move commended by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.The story that is unfolding in front of our eyes is one of bitter and selfish Western governments that put their obsession for regional hegemony above humanitarian issues. What happened to Syria and Türkiye should not be politicized and should not result in the deaths of those who are not in any way involved.The sanctions on Syria have killed innocent civilians, and the inaction of the West in aiding the Syrian people at this time is tantamount to abandoning those who could have been saved. If we now know that the sanctions block aid, why is it acceptable that the US only temporarily freeze them? They should not be in place at all, and neither should US forces occupy Syrian territory.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571653-syria-earthquake-us-led-economic/,2023,2,18

The museum will gradually take down the eleven Chinese-made cameras throughout the year, stating that the Hikvision models made up a small fraction of the 200 other cameras and were not filming any “significant historical exhibits.”Australian opposition senator and Shadow Minister for Cyber Security and Countering Foreign Interference James Paterson welcomed the decision. “A Chinese government-linked surveillance company has no place on the grounds of our most sacred monument to Australians who fought and died for freedom,” Paterson told the Canberra Times. The politician added when speaking to ABC TV that he was working on a “full audit” of the government’s departments and agencies to assess exposure to possible surveillance by Beijing. Paterson is certain that Chinese-made cameras pose “national security risks.”Hikvision has yet to comment on the decision by the Australian museum, but it denied similar “spying” accusations from the UK in November.

Jay wrote that while “there was a credible suspicion that Ms Begum had been trafficked to Syria” and sexually exploited, the evidence of this was insufficient to trump Javid’s national security concerns.Since she was discovered in Syria, Begum has spoken extensively to the press, becoming one of the most widely-known ‘ISIS brides.’ She told reporters in 2019 that she didn’t regret making the trip, and that the sight of severed heads “didn’t faze me at all.” In further interviews she described terror attacks on British soil as “justified,” but insisted that she was ready to return to the UK and live a regular life.Despite losing her British citizenship, Begum is not stateless, and is a citizen of Bangladesh by descent. However, she has made no attempts to seek transfer to Bangladesh, where Foreign Minister Abdul Momen warned in 2019 that she would face the death penalty for terrorism.

It also included figures from investment banking company Goldman Sachs and Angus Lapsley, the NATO assistant secretary general for defense policy and planning.Gove, who was a central voice in the ‘Leave’ movement in 2016, is also understood to have been “honest” about problems presented as a result of the vote, though he maintained a position that Brexit will prove to be a good choice long-term.The documents detailing the summit also said that “rejoining the EU will not be on the agenda” but noted that the UK and EU share common goals when it comes to the energy and technology sectors, the relationship with Washington, and “containing Russian aggression”. They also raised questions about the benefits of closer links between the UK and the 27-member European bloc.The Northern Ireland protocol, which aims to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without affecting trading ties between the UK and EU, is currently a central issue in Brussels and was also prominently discussed at the summit, The Observer wrote. The matter remains unresolved several years after Brexit came into effect.The nature of the talks reflects wider concerns from within the UK political ecosystem that Brexit will continue to damage the UK economy, as well as its strategic influence across the globe.

Church of England discusses gender-neutral God — RT World News,"        Church of England discusses gender-neutral God                        If liberal clergy get their way, the Almighty Father may be stricken from the scriptures            Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby raises his arm during the Church of England Synod in London, Britain, February 7, 2023 ©                AFP  Justin TallisLiberal Christians are pushing the Church of England to abolish gendered references to God from scriptures and services, the Telegraph reported on Tuesday. Describing God as a man, they argue, is a “theological misreading.”The argument was brought up at a sitting of the General Synod – the Church’s lawmaking body – this week. According to the Telegraph, the Reverend Joanna Stobart of Bath and Wells asked the Liturgical Commission what steps were being taken “to develop more inclusive language in our authorized liturgy.”Stobart said that she wanted more options to “speak of God in a non-gendered way,” and more prayers that didn’t refer to God “using male pronouns.”The Liturgical Commission is responsible for setting out how church services are conducted, including what kind of language is used during these services. Its vice-chairman, the Bishop of Litchfield, told Stobart that the commission has “been exploring the use of gendered language in relation to God for several years,” and would discuss the matter with the Faith and Order Commission this spring.Read moreChristmas carol rewritten to be more ‘inclusive’However, any change to the Church’s liturgy would require the unanimous approval of the Synod, where there is strong opposition.“The fact that God is called ‘Father’ can’t be substituted by ‘Mother’ without changing meaning, nor can it be gender-neutralized to ‘Parent’ without loss of meaning,” Rev. Ian Paul, a member of the Church’s Archbishop’s Council, said in response to Stobart’s proposal.“Fathers and mothers are not interchangeable but relate to their offspring in different ways,” he continued. “If the Liturgical Commission seeks to change this, then in an important way they will be moving the doctrine of the Church away from being grounded in the Scriptures.”The Church of England differs from the Catholic Church in several key ways: It does not recognize the Pope as the one appointed ‘Vicar of Christ’, it allows clergy to marry, and it permits women to be ordained, all while delegating more authority to individual bishops and ministers. Thus, while orders from the Vatican forbid Catholic priests from blessing same-sex unions, the General Synod of the Church of England is currently preparing for a divisive vote on the matter this week.While the catechisms of both the Catholic and Anglican churches define God as neither a man nor a woman, both refer to him as male in their liturgy.

We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s,” he added.Amid outrage from Tory MPs and officials – among them Home Secretary Suella Braverman and Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer – the BBC stated it was taking the matter “seriously” and would have a “frank conversation” with the ‘Match of the Day’ host, who said he had been in touch with BBC director-general Tim Davie.: BBC issues apology as sex noises interrupt football broadcast (VIDEO)The BBC’s former chief of editorial policy, Richard Ayre, suggested Davie would be forced to sack Lineker over the comments, telling BBC Radio 4 “I don’t think he is going to have any choice but to let him go unless he can be certain that this is the end of it.”However, on Thursday the host said the “ridiculously out of proportion” response to his tweets seemed to be “abating,” indicating that he would not face dismissal following discussions with higher-ups at the broadcaster. Though it remains unclear whether he will see any disciplinary action, Lineker said he stands by his comments, vowing to “continue to try and speak up for those poor souls that have no voice.”Lineker later received support from fellow journalists, with Sky News pundit Adam Boulton saying he is “entitled to say what he likes” on social media, especially given that he does not cover political subjects. TV personality Piers Morgan also backedLineker on similar grounds.Though BBC reporters are ostensibly required to remain impartial toward political matters in their public commentary, Lineker is not a permanent staffer, but rather a freelance employee, meaning he is not subject to the same guidelines. However, the BBC also maintains separate rules governing the use of social media which apply to all of its workers, and warns that violations could lead to “disciplinary action” up to and including “possible termination of employment in serious circumstances.”:    India’s clash with the BBC is a warning of things to come                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572727-bbc-presenter-immigration-nazi/,2023,3,10

GrayAustralia has insisted it will keep US nuclear propulsion technology under tight lock and key after it gains access to sensitive information, with Canberra’s envoy to Washington pledging to safeguard America’s “crown jewels.”Speaking to an audience at a US think tank on Thursday, outgoing Ambassador Arthur Sinodinos said much progress had been made on the three-way AUKUS deal signed between the US, Australia, and the UK in 2021, the details of which are set to be unveiled later this month.“The very fact that the Americans are prepared to share their crown jewels with us implies that there will have to be progress on the seamless transfer of technology. None of us want this to be bogged down,” he told the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC.“And I think that state of mind has now permeated through various levels of the [US] administration,” Sinodinos added.: US-China war by 2025: A self-fulfilling prophecy?Though the particulars of the submarine technology transfer have not been made public, Sinodinos stated that Australia has “assured Americans” and demonstrated “the sort of protection of information measures that we take to make sure they understand that their technology is safe in terms of leakage to third parties.”The US maintains tight export controls on certain military hardware, which has created obstacles for past weapons transfers abroad. Sinodinos suggested Australia could be granted an exemption under the American regulations, saying “work is underway” but “it's not finished.”In December, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his British and Australian counterparts to further hammer out the AUKUS deal, declaring that Washington is committed to furnishing new capabilities to Australia “at the earliest possible date.” At the time, Canberra’s defense chief, Richard Marles, spoke of an “enormous sense of shared mission” between the three allies, also noting that the US rarely shares its nuclear technology, even with close partners.Asked about the precautions Australia would take to protect sensitive information given its lack of a domestic nuclear propulsion industry, Marles said on Friday that the technology would be kept under the “highest degree” of security.“In a short period of time we’ll be announcing the optimal pathway for Australia acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine capability, and being a nuclear steward in this context is a really important part of that announcement,” he told reporters. “It does involve a really significant hardening of security in a physical sense, with buildings and fences and the like, but also in an IT sense.”:    AUKUS military chiefs discuss nuclear sub planThe trilateral AUKUS pact has come under fire from Russia and China.

As a result, they have turned to Bulgaria and other countries that were formerly in the “Soviet orbit” to help produce the weaponry that Ukraine needs to battle Russian forces.The search has required secrecy to avoid “political fallout and Russian retaliation” because, as in the case of Bulgaria, the local populations are largely pro-Russian, the Times said.

Western state media unites for 'disinformation' drive — RT World News,"        Western state media unites for 'disinformation' drive                        Important public conversations should not be left to “the major American platforms”, ZDF director Norbert Himmler has insisted            Avaaz-led protest against Facebook ©                Getty Images  Zach GibsonPublic broadcasters from Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, and Germany have launched a new platform aimed at fostering “fact-based communication” online while shielding participants from what they describe as the growing ""threat of propaganda"". Called Public Spaces Incubator, the project was announced on Wednesday by the German public broadcaster ZDF in collaboration with the CBC (Canada), SRG (Switzerland), and RTBF (Belgium).The platform seeks to “enable civic engagement and democratic discourse in digital space away from hate comments and increasing disinformation,” according to the press release. The aim is to show how state-backed media can “create independent and fact-based communication spaces in the digital world.”Supposedly free from “commercial aspects,” Public Spaces Incubator claims to be exclusively interested in “open and respectful online discussions” and “the interests of the users.” It’s not clear what happens when those two are at cross purposes, however.Read moreOn Covid-19 and beyond, Western democracies are deploying military-grade propaganda to fight dissent“Democracy thrives on an open and fair dialogue in society,” ZDF director Norbert Himmler said in the press release, warning against leaving such conversations to “the major American platforms.” Public Spaces Incubator, he said, was meant to provide a “public service alternative” to the increasingly violent, hate-filled platforms currently dominating the social media scene.The initiative is a collaboration with New_ Public, whose co-founder, Eli Parisier, also co-founded Avaaz, an activist group notorious for advocating ideologically-motivated online censorship. Parisier is credited with coining the term “filter bubble” in his 2011 book of the same name, in which he drew attention to the danger of social media algorithms that filter out dissenting views. New_ Public’s other co-founder, Deepti Doshi, hails from Meta, formerly Facebook – a platform arguably synonymous with the filter bubble.The battle against “disinformation” has attracted intense attention in recent months from international entities like the World Health Organization and the United Nations, as well as elite gatherings like the World Economic Forum. It was confirmed last week that the US, UK and Canada all deployed military-grade technology, including psychological operations, to suppress so-called disinformation that ran counter to their respective governments’ Covid-19 policies.Civil liberties groups have warned that this term (along with its cousins “misinformation” and “malinformation”) is ill-defined and easily weaponized to censor dissenting views, even in democracies that have legal protections against such abuses.

The leader was speaking at the European Parliament on Thursday as part of a tour to rally support and weaponryfor Ukraine amid the conflict with Russia.Starting his address with the slogan ‘Glory to Ukraine’, which is commonly associated with World War II-era Nazi collaborators but is widely used in present-day Ukraine, Zelensky reiterated Kiev’s aspirations to join the EU, describing it as “home.”“We want to come home to Europe,” the Ukrainian leader told the assembled lawmakers in Brussels, adding:“I’m here in order to defend our people’s way home.” Zelensky went on to describe Russia as “the most anti-European force” in the world, alleging that Moscow is intent on destroying the “European way of life” for all 27 members of the EU.“This is our Europe, these are our rules, this is our way of life,” Zelensky stated, earning applause from the audience. “Europe will always be, and remain Europe as long as we are together and as long as we take care of our Europe, as we take care of the European way of life.” : UK offers to train Ukrainian pilotsJoining the EU has been a significant talking point for pro-Western Ukrainian politicians for decades. Yet little to no actual progress had been made along that path prior to hostilities breaking out between Moscow and Kiev last February. The conflict has greatly sped up the accession process, with Ukraine receiving EU candidate status in June.Zelensky’s European tour began a day earlier when he traveled to the UK, meeting leaders and lawmakers in London. The president inspected the ongoing training of Ukrainian troops on British soil and secured additional support from the UK.“I am proud that today we will expand that training from soldiers to marines and fighter jet pilots, ensuring Ukraine has a military able to defend its interests well into the future,” said a statement from UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after he met Zelensky.Ukraine has consistently increased its demands for advanced weaponry from the West, including tanks, drones, fighter jets, and longer-range missiles. Kiev has insisted that the hardware is needed to drive Russian forces out of territories that Ukraine claims as its own. Moscow has repeatedly urged the West to stop “pumping” Ukraine with weaponry, maintaining that continuous military aid will only prolong the hostilities, rather than change their ultimate outcome.

These useless textiles are often burned or dumped in landfills, despite most of them being made of toxic synthetic materials, the report claimed.Published last week, the report found that of the 149 million items of used textiles exported to Kenya every year by the EU and UK, 74 million are instantly classified as waste upon arrival. Furthermore, almost 50 million of these waste items are plastic-based, meaning they cannot be easily disposed of.Germany sends more of this waste clothing than any other European country, shipping 25 million waste items to Kenya every year. Poland is in second place, sending 18.5 million, with the UK sending 18.3 million. These three countries, along with Hungary, Italy, Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia, France, and Ireland, are responsible for 95% of all second-hand clothing exports from the EU to Kenya.These statistics were compiled by Clean Up Kenya and Wildlight on behalf of the Netherlands-based Changing Markets Foundation.

However, while the report says that “the lion’s share” of imports from Europe are waste, an industry spokesperson told Euronews that this is “misinformation.”""This European report assumes that[clothing] traders in Kenya spend their money importing 50 per cent waste,"" the spokesperson said, adding that importers would be “fools” to do this.

Outgoing UK prime ministers traditionally submit lists of potential figures to receive the honor when they leave office.“The idea that Boris Johnson is nominating his dad for a knighthood – you only need to say it to realize how ridiculous it is,” Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Monday on LBC radio. “It’s classic of a man like Johnson.

In one region of the UK, the number of such offenses has more than doubled since the start of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine in February 2022.The outlet’s findings were based on the information it received in response to freedom of information requests it sent to 45 territorial police forces and British Transport Police. Out of this number, just 14 provided data on crimes targeting Russians.The rest either did not respond to Sky, or said it would be too difficult to collect such information, or did not register any such crimes. Some police forces also told the outlet that the nationality of crime victims was often not recorded.The offenses include an assault on a building site in Derbyshire in central England, which saw a worker telling his victim before attacking him: “I hate you Russians – you kill people,” the report says. In another instance, according to Hertfordshire Police quoted by Sky, a Russian victim was pushed to the floor, with the culprit saying “All Russians are murderers.”Read moreAnti-Asian hate crimes in the US are the direct result of Washington’s foreign policyA Russian-born woman living in North Wales was abused by her neighbor who told her: “Why are you still here?

For instance, Greater Manchester Police recorded 13 race hate crimes against Russians since the start of the Ukraine conflict, compared to just six in 2021 and two in 2020.Police of Derbyshire told Sky that it had recorded four offenses targeting Russians since 24 February 2022, which included a violent assault, criminal damage and racially aggravated harassment. In 2021, no such crimes are said to have been registered.In March 2022, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it had seen “an unprecedented level of Russophobia” in numerous countries amid the Ukraine conflict. In early June, it released a report on the matter, noting that the most common actions in this regard include refusal to provide various services, crackdown on Russia-linked business and coercion to condemn Moscow’s actions.

Biden reacts to Russia suspending nuclear treaty — RT World News,"        Biden reacts to Russia suspending nuclear treaty                        Moscow’s decision on New START is a “big mistake,” the US leader has said            US President Joe Biden (center) after meetings with NATO leaders in Warsaw, Poland, February 22, 2023. ©                AP Photo   Evan VucciUS President Joe Biden on Wednesday disapproved of Moscow’s decision to suspend the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the two powers. In a speech to lawmakers the day prior, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move was in response to “unacceptable” and cynical moves by the West.Biden was wrapping up his visit to Ukraine and Poland with a photo-op in Warsaw when one of the reporters shouted a question about the treaty.“I don’t have time,” the US president said at first. Pausing, he said, “big mistake.”The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known in the US as ‘New START’ and in Russia as ‘SNV-III’, was originally signed in 2010. Biden had agreed to extend it through 2026 during his first week in office. The US had previously withdrawn from the INF and Open Skies treaties, leaving New START as the last arms control agreement standing.Read moreRussia suspends last nuclear treaty with USAddressing the Russian legislature on Tuesday, Putin said Russia would be “suspending its membership” in New START, but not withdrawing from the treaty. He accused the US of trying to “refashion the international order to suit exclusively its own needs and selfish interests,” demanding that Moscow abide by treaties such as New START “while they will do as they please” and Western leaders publicly make statements about “inflicting a strategic defeat” on Russia.“This is either the height of hypocrisy and cynicism, or the height of stupidity, but they are not idiots. They are not stupid,” the Russian leader said.Putin pointed out that NATO – which is not even a party to New START – had made “absurd” demands to inspect the Russian nuclear deterrent, even as the US-led bloc was openly aiding Ukraine in carrying out drone attacks against strategic aviation bases that host atomic weapons.Before Moscow can return to the table, Putin said, it must have “a clear idea” of NATO’s nuclear arsenal – including the UK and France, who are welcome to join the treaty.“Come onboard, we do not mind. Just try not to lie to everyone this time and present yourselves as champions of peace and detente. We know the truth,” the Russian president said.:    What you need to know about the US-Russia nuclear treaty that Moscow suspendedIn August 2022, Moscow suspended the New Start inspection regime, saying US sanctions had prevented Russian inspectors from doing their job, giving Washington an unfair advantage. Technical talks on resuming the inspections, scheduled for the end of November in Egypt, were postponed indefinitely. Russia said there was no point in talking to the US while Washington was sending billions of dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine.

Francisco J. Diaz Jr.US Marine Corps via Getty ImagesThe military aircraft billed as America’s latest and greatest fighter jet, the F-35, has been recalled globally to fix an engine problem that led to the grounding of some planes and the halting of new deliveries.The Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) ordered the fix earlier this week, calling for all of the jets to be retrofitted within 90 days. The order applies to all of the nearly 900 F-35s that defense contractor Lockheed Martin has delivered worldwide, including those that have been grounded since a December 15 crash at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas.An investigation found that engine vibration led to the crash, in which a hovering F-35 that was landing vertically suddenly bounced upward before lurching forward and skidding around on its nose and right wing. That incident involved the F-35B Lightning II variant of the fighter jet, which is used by the US Marine Corps.Read moreUS military grounds some of its top fighter jets – mediaLockheed responded by suspending acceptance flights for new F-35s, which are required before the aircraft can be delivered to customers. The Pentagon and the maker of the F-35’s propulsion system, Pratt & Whitney, stopped engine deliveries later in December.Investigatorsreportedly traced the problem to engine vibration, which the JPO said occurred rarely and was thought to be an issue in recently built F-35s. A Pratt & Whitney executive told reporters earlier this week that engineers had developed an “immediate resolution” for the problem and that “some jets” would need to be retrofitted, Breaking Defense reported.However, the JPO order applies to all F-35s, including those supplied to foreign militaries. The US has sold F-35s to such countries as Israel, Japan and the UK.Some US lawmakers have estimated that it will cost $1.3 trillion to sustain the nation’s F-35 fleet, partly because of poor reliability. According to one estimate, only 30% of the jets, on average, are capable of performing all of their assigned tasks at any point in time.

The WTA and ATP responded by stripping the Grand Slam tournament of ranking points and imposing a fine against UK tennis.The LTA now faces losing the rights to host pre-Wimbledon grass tournaments such as Edgbaston and Queen’s Club, an association insider told the Guardian.

The poll comes amid a deliberate push for ‘diversity’ among advertisers.Some 45% of British viewers said that there are more ethnic minorities on television than in the population, according to a summary of the poll published by The Times on Tuesday. Only 26% thought that ethnic minorities were under-represented.A similar figure, 44%, said that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people are over-represented on the small screen.YouGov ran the same poll in France, Italy, Spain, Chile, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia, and found that viewers in all of these other countries were more likely to say that both groups were under-represented.Read moreBBC staff told there are more than 150 genders – TelegraphOn internet forums, social media platforms, and online comment sections, viewers have long complained about the apparently disproportionate airtime given to minorities, particularly since ‘woke’ ideology entered the cultural mainstream over the last decade. While there is little authoritative research to back up or disprove these claims, a number of studies suggest that the demographics seen on TV might not represent reality.A 2017 survey of 500 companies found that marketing departments were so concerned about being accused of racism or homophobia that they were using fewer straight, white models and actors in their advertisements. A third of these companies said that they used fewer white people and heterosexuals over the preceding year, with a third of this number saying that they had done so to “prevent perceived discrimination.”A study by the Campaign for Common Sense last year noted that ‘The Responder’, a BBC production, depicted almost half of the Merseyside Police force as black or Asian, despite both of these groups combined making up less than 1% of the force’s officers. The study found the same issue with several other BBC series, and accused the state broadcaster of “warping modern Britain.”Black people make up around 3% of the British population, Asians (a term that in the UK includes Middle Easterners) account for 7%, while LGBT people make up less than 4%. However, a 2022 survey by the Campaign for Common Sense discovered that British people think that 20% of the population is black, 17% Asian, and 30% LGBT.

It follows similar measures in the US, EU, and Canada.The ban will be imposed next week and reevaluated after six months, De Croo said in a statement. Government employees will be allowed to use the app on their personal devices, but not on any devices “whose purchase, subscription or use are partly or fully paid for by the federal government.”Citing reports by the Belgian State Security Service and Centre for Cybersecurity, De Croo claimed that TikTok collects large amounts of user data, manipulates the information users are exposed to, and cooperates with Chinese spy agencies.“We must not be naive,” De Croo said. “TikTok is a Chinese company that today is obliged to cooperate with the Chinese intelligence services.”Read moreMichigan governor exempt from new TikTok banTikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company headquartered in Beijing. A spokesperson for TikTok said on Friday that user data is stored on servers outside of China, which the Chinese government has no access to. TikTok itself has headquarters in the US, Ireland, Singapore, and the UK.De Croo’s ban follows similar decisions across the Western World. In the US, the Biden administration ordered all federal agencies to ban the app from government-issued devices last month, while a similar ban was ordered in Canada. The European Union’s three main institutions have also forbidden employees from using the app on work devices, as has the Danish Defense Ministry.While TikTok insists that all user data is stored outside of China, it confirmed last year that its China-based staff could access this data remotely.

However, he urged that Ukrainian pilots, who are only familiar with Soviet-made aircraft, begin training on the Western planes as soon as possible.“I don’t expect the delivery of fighter jets to happen anytime soon because it’s a very difficult task logistically and technically. Therefore, we advise that the training of Ukrainian pilots on Western jets should start now, so that when the decision to provide aircraft is made, we do not waste time or many months on training,” he said.The diplomat also urged Berlin to ramp up deliveries of ammunition to Ukraine, namely artillery shells, claiming that while German industry had already expressed a readiness to provide them, the issue lies with the country's government.“We sat down with Ukrainian representatives and the German armaments industry ... and German industry, in my presence, asked the German government for one thing: signed contracts,” he stated.: US assessing Ukrainians for possible F-16 training – NBCOver the course of the conflict, Ukraine has increasingly demanded more and more sophisticated weapon systems from its Western backers. Kiev has intensified calls for NATO to supply it with fighter jets – namely the US-made F-16 – in recent months after securing a pledge for dozens of Leopard 2 and Leopard 1, M1 Abrams, and Challenger 2 main battle tanks from multiple EU countries, the US, and UK, respectively.So far, however, the West has been reluctant to provide Ukraine with modern aircraft. Late in February, US President Joe Biden said he was “ruling it out for now.” His Ukrainian counterpart Vladimir Zelensky “doesn’t need F-16s now. There is no basis upon which there is a rationale, according to our military, now, to provide F-16s,” Biden told ABC at the time.Still, American media reported that the Pentagon has already invited Ukrainian pilots to a military base in Arizona to determine how long it would take to train them to fly the F-16. Last week, unnamed officials told NBC that two Ukrainian airmen had already arrived on American soil and more were likely to follow.Russia has repeatedly warned the West against “pumping” Ukraine with assorted weaponry, maintaining it would only prolong the hostilities rather than change the ultimate outcome.

Stoltenberg also called on the bloc’s members to increase their intelligence efforts, accusing China and Russia of spying on them with balloons.“The war in Ukraine is consuming an enormous amount of ammunition,” he said ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. “This puts our defense industries under strain,” he continued, adding that “we need to ramp up production and invest in our production capacities.”Stoltenberg then pledged, as he has repeatedly since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began, that “NATO stands with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”“Standing with Ukraine” has proven costly for NATO, particularly its European members. After decades of underinvestment, the German military rapidly emptied its stockpiles for Ukraine and reportedly has only enough ammunition for two days of warfare.

The signpost had remained untouched for some 20 years and direly needed to be repaired, the agency explained.The ‘upgrade’ of the post included adding plaques for the capitals or “iconic cities” of Ukraine’s top supporters in the ongoing conflict with Moscow, including Ottawa and New York, among others. The work also involved efforts to “de-communize” and “de-Russify” the installation, the agency explained.The explorers switched the Russian spelling of the cities of Odessa and Vinnitsa to the Ukrainian version, while also changing the name of the city of Kirovograd to Kropivnitsky to reflect a renaming carried out in post-Maidan Ukraine in 2016 amid a “decommunization” drive spearheaded by then-President Pyotr Poroshenko.: Neo-Nazi brotherhood: How American friends of Ukrainian fascists plotted a terror attack in the US and the media ignored the storyThe plaques denoting the cities were repainting in the colors of the Ukrainian flag – and also received a neo-Nazi touch. The signpost received plaques for Mariupol, a formerly Ukrainian city in what is now Russia’s Donetsk People’s Republic, and also for the Kiev suburb of Bucha, the site of an alleged massacre of civilians attributed by Ukraine and its backers to Russian forces.Both plaques were painted in the red and black of the UPA, a paramilitary force that originally emerged during the WWII era and was known for collaboration with Nazi Germany and assorted atrocities against Polish and Soviet civilians. In modern Ukraine, the UPA is hailed as a “liberator” force, with its members glorified as Ukrainian ‘heroes,’ while its flag is commonly used by present-day Ukrainian neo-Nazis.

Hersh said that the attack was largely intended to remove Berlin’s ability to lift sanctions on Russia and resume buying Russian gas – which is significantly cheaper than American liquefied natural gas.These sanctions have been ineffective. According to the most recent figures from the International Monetary Fund, Russia’s economy is set to grow faster than that of the UK and Germany this year, and faster than all of the G7 nations in 2024.Yet the West continues to prepare more sanctions on Moscow out of “incompetence,” Young told RT. “Our leaders are intellectually bankrupt.

The outlet bills itself as “an online rapid-response vehicle for documenting, exposing, and neutralizing liberal bias in the media.”The extensive global influence of the Hungarian tycoonis well-known, and Soros himself has admitted iton countless occasions – includingboasts about his efforts in Ukraine. Soros openly declaredhis role in promotingthe 2014 US-orchestrated Maidan coup in Kiev, stating at the time:“I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia [sic].

And it played an important part in events now.”Read moreLasers, spaceflight, surgery, nuclear power and the secrets of Mayan civilization: How Russian scientists changed the worldIn a lengthy interview with the New York Times in October of 2019, Soros explained:“The arc of history doesn’t follow its own course [and] needs to be bent,” and he was “engaged in trying to bend it in the right direction.”The Newsbuster report identifies the hundreds of media, humanitarian, and social justice organizations that Soros funds annually and asserts that his donations allow him to “wield massive power over information in international politics,” and“mold public opinion on practically every continent and in many languages.”Who gets the money?Newsbusters lists Project Syndicate as the biggest propaganda platform funded by the Hungarian. It styles itself as “the world’s opinion page” and has a “global audience” that includes “prominent politicians, policymakers, scholars, business leaders, and civic activists from six continents” and “over 140 heads of state.” From 2016 - 2020, he funneled at least $1.5 million to the outlet. Itactively promoted abortion, criticism of Israel and pushed for global climate lockdowns during this period.The Poynter Institute is also at the top of this list, which Newsbusters condemns as “a global Soros-backed Ministry of Truth.” It received $492,000 during the same period. This money was used to finance Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network, which brings together 100 so-called “fact-checkers”. The network includes the controversial PolitiFact, and actively works with major social media platforms to boost their operations, while censoring alternative voices and opinions.

His foundation supports a broad range of social justice activists, who often become media and online influencers. For example, in July 2021, he pledged $100 million to advance the cause of radical feminism worldwide over the next five years.Organizations receiving cash secure major news coverage for events and activities they orchestrate on his dime, and influence public perception along the way. Soros has explicitly stated that his goal is to ensure “more women, transgender, and gender non-conforming people in positions of leadership in politics and governance,” are drawn from these recipients.The individual donations from the tycoon, his foundations, and network may appear minor based on their size, but the total volume of financial support over the entire network of nearly 300 organizations is highly significant.

He stated that “one of the biggest consequences” of Soros funding and effectively controlling major media outlets is “creating a filter on what we can see” in the general public.It’s not merely individual news outlets, but journalists at highly influential Western publications – including The New York Times, Washington Post, CBS, CNN, and ABC – who are influencedby his money.Soros assets identified in the Newsbusters report,substantiated by Palumbo, help insulate him from inquiry“as reporters see him as an ally, not a target for investigation.”That’s going to influence your coverage. Just type in Soros’ name in any of the major liberal publications he’s linked to and see how they cover him,” Palumbo assesses.He believes this clout means Soros “can create any impression” he wants about any issue - including the false narrative that any criticism of him is anti-Semitic.“If they’re ever covering him in a negative way, it’s framed as if his critics are the bad guys for noticing.…but because it’s convenient for them on the left, they can do that and the media goes along with it,” Palumbo explained.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist described how US divers planted the explosives, also alleging that a Norwegian airplane gave the detonation signal.The White House dismissed Hersh’s story as “utterly false and complete fiction.” Price himself called it “utter and complete nonsense” at a briefing last week, prompting his Russian counterpart, Maria Zakharova, to accuse him of “once again lying live on air, openly mocking journalists who asked fully justified questions.”: Russia wants UN probe into Nord Stream blastsIn an interviewwith the German outlet Berliner Zeitung over the weekend, Hersh stood by his claims and said that theincident happened because US President Joe Biden “would rather see Germany freeze than Germany possibly stop supporting Ukraine.”Meanwhile, when asked about a UN probe into the Nord Stream sabotage, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday that the world body would need to “have a mandate, which we don’t, clearly.”Denmark, in whose waters the explosions happened, is a NATO member. Both Denmark and Sweden – which is trying to join the US-led bloc – have refused to even respond to Russian requests for an investigation.

Support for Ukraine aid in decline across West – polls — RT World News,"        Support for Ukraine aid in decline across West – polls                        Continued assistance to Kiev is becoming less popular both in the US and Western Europe, a survey has reported            A rally for peace is held in Berlin, Germany, on February 25, 2023. ©                Global Look Press  IMAGO  Bernd ElmenthalerA year into the Russia-Ukraine conflict, public support for military and financial assistance to Kiev is in decline in the West, a joint survey by the Economist magazine and the pollster YouGov has shown.Even the most ardent backers of Ukraine are now less enthusiastic about supporting the country, the Economistadded,while revealing the poll results on Monday.Among US Democrats, support for financial aid to Kiev fell from 82% to 75% between April 2022 and February 2023, the poll revealed. Republican support for similar measures almost halved over the same period, from 67% to 39%, it added.Sending battle tanks to Kiev still appeared to be a popular option, as their delivery to Ukraine was supported by 70% of Democrats and just under 50% of Republicans between late January and mid-February 2023. A poll conducted by the Associated Press in mid-February showed, however, that less than a half of Americans support military aid to Kiev.Public backing for further restrictions against Moscow that could increase the cost of living in Europe has sharply declinedin major European nations over the past year, according to the poll.Read moreFewer Americans think Ukraine is winning – pollIn February 2022, 45% of Britons said they would favour such sanctions, but in December 2022 the level of support for the measures dropped to 35% in the UK. In Germany, it fell from almost 40% to less than 30% over the same period, while Spain, Italy and France followed a similar trend.Another poll published by YouGov on February 24, showed that people in some European nations, including France and Italy, tend to favor a negotiated solution to the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, over supporting Ukraine for “as long as it takes.”In Italy, 47% of respondents said they would like to see a negotiated end to the fighting, even if it means Kiev having to cede control over some territories to Russia. In France, 38% of people supported this option. Only 29% of Italians and 37% of the French believed Kiev should be supported further, even if it means the conflict will last longer.Major European nations also saw a decline in support for almost all types of aid to Kiev over the second half of 2022. Most Europeans also believed that conflict had reached a stalemate, with Spanish citizens believing Russia was gaining the upper hand in it. The idea that Kiev is winning the conflict was shared by only a small minority in the European nations covered by the poll.

The paper was skeptical about the initiative, however, noting that such a small number of jets is unlikely to change the situation in the skies over Ukraine.According to the media outlet, the AMX Ghibli fighter-bombers are scheduled to be retired altogether by the Italian Air Force by the end of the year. “Delivery of Tornados or Eurofighters is more complex,” it said.Rome does not want to be the first nation to supply Kiev with Western-made aircraft, La Repubblica said. It would agree to deliver the planes only if other countries do so first, the paper explained, adding that Italy wants some other “allies” like the UK to lead the charge.Read moreF-16s useless in Ukraine – Wagner pilotItaly would also reportedly not prevent the UK from sending Typhoon fighter jets to Ukraine, the paper said, adding that such a move would require the consent of all nations involved in the fighter jets’ production.London itself is in no rush to supply Ukraine with warplanes. Earlier in February, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News that the UK would not be sending jets to Kiev anytime soon. Some 200 Royal Air Force personnel would have to accompany the planes, he argued.Instead, the UK and other Western nations are focused on ensuring Ukraine’s “long-term resilience” through other means like surface-to-air missiles or drones, which have “the same effects” as fighter jets, according to Wallace.Last week, the Financial Times reported that the US may still consider sending F-16 fighter jets to Kiev or greenlight their re-export from other nations. Kiev has repeatedly asked its Western backers for heavier weapons like warplanes and fighter jets.

With its stocks depleted and sent to Ukraine, a number of recent reports suggest that the British army would run out of ammo within days or hours of combat starting.“There are serious problems with ammunition shortages and other kit which is partly due to underspending, but also because of the amount of ammo and other ordnance we are supplying to Ukraine,” an unnamed source at the Ministry of Defence told the newspaper. “Our forces are also stretched because of the extent to which they are training Ukrainian forces.”The UK is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States, with London committing £2.3 billion ($2.77 billion) to Kiev’s forces last year. Britain has trained around 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers, and plans to train another 20,000 – plus pilots – this year, according to government figures.

However, according to a German report cited by the Daily Mail, NATO chiefs have asked Berlin to remain in charge, as the UK reportedly cannot spare the 5,000 troops necessary for the role.The Mail’s article is the latest in a long line of similar reports criticizing Britain’s lack of military readiness.

The sex offender's case had previously grabbed media headlines and sparked uproar after she was briefly placed in an all-female prison facility.Bryson, 31, was found guilty last month of raping two women while still living as a man. One offense took place in the town of Clydebank near Glasgow in 2016, while the other one happened in Glasgow’s district of Drumchapel three years later.According to the prosecution, Bryson met both victims online and “preyed” on vulnerable women.Judge Lord Scott argued that Bryson was at “high risk” of reoffending andsentenced her to another three years on license, meaning there will be a period of supervision after the release.Bryson, known as Adam Graham at the time of the rapes, denied all the charges, claiming that both victims had consented to having sex and arguing that she “would never hurt another human being.”: Trans inmate fears she ‘wouldn’t survive’ switch to male prisonHowever, during sentencing, Judge Lord Scott dismissed Bryson’s claims that the rape victims colluded to place the blame on him. “You see yourself as the victim in this situation. You are not,” he said.While conceding that Bryson could be deemed “vulnerable in some ways” due to adverse childhood experiences, he stressed that this factor could not serve as an excuse for raping two women.Bryson's case sparked a media frenzy after she was initially placed in the all-female Cornton Vale prison, with politicians and activists voicing concerns over whether the safety of women in the facility could be compromised by the presence of the transgender sex offender.While the Scottish Prison Service concluded that Bryson did not pose any threat to other female inmates, following the backlash and an intervention by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she was moved to a male facility.At the time, Sturgeon said that while it was not appropriate for her to give details of where inmates are being incarcerated, she confirmed that Bryson would not be placed at Cornton Vale, expressing hope that this decision would “provide assurance to the public.”                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572204-transgender-rapist-uk-jail/,2023,2,28

Kiev has demanded that NATO countries hand over their warplanes, but the Western bloc has sent mixed signals thus far.Speaking to CNN on Thursday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that combat aircraft “are not the key capability” the Ukrainian military needs at the moment.“F-16s are not a question for the short-term fight,” he elaborated. “F-16s are a question for the long-term defense of Ukraine and that’s a conversation that [US] President Biden and [Ukrainian] President Zelensky had.”Biden met with Zelensky in Kiev on Monday, where the Ukrainian president reportedly asked his American counterpart to transfer F-16 fighter jets to his forces. Biden had previously rejected Zelensky’s pleas for the American-made fighters, simply telling reporters “no” when asked about the possibility in January.Read moreUkraine demands Germany crosses all weapons ‘red lines’Zelensky and his officials have demanded combat aircraft from multiple countries, including the UK. While former Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss have urged the government to donate a fleet of Eurofighter Typhoon fighters, Defense Minister Ben Wallace said on Friday that “we’re not going to send our own Typhoon jets in the short term to Ukraine.”“Gifting a fighter jet comes with hundreds of people: engineers, pilots, training, electronic warfare,” he told Sky News on Friday. “The West is not going to be putting troops into Ukraine on those scales. The idea that we would put Typhoons in – we would have to send 200 [Royal Air Force] people and we’re not going to do that … at this current stage.”Sunak said earlier this month that the UK will train Ukrainian fighter pilots, and Wallace said on Friday that London is prepared to supply Typhoon jets to Eastern European countries who send their own Soviet-era planes to Kiev.Across the rest of the NATO bloc, national leaders have been more elusive on the potential supply of warplanes. The leaders of France and the Netherlands have both declared that the idea is being considered, while Italy was reportedly nearing adeal involving the transfer of five aging ground attack and fighter planes, before Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ruled the possibility out on Tuesday.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly shot down Ukraine’s requests for jets, and urged his allies last month against “entering into a constant competition to outbid each other when it comes to weapons systems.” However, Berlin initially refused to provide Ukraine with tanks, before succumbing to a pressure campaign led by Kiev and its most committed supporters in Eastern Europe.

‘Our Parent in Heaven’: Liberals push for a gender-neutral God — RT World News,"        ‘Our Parent in Heaven’: Liberals push for a gender-neutral God                        The Church of England is considering changing the scriptures so that the Lord is no longer a ‘he’            Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of 'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of 'Midnight in the American Empire,'How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_BridgeYork Minster on April 04, 2021 in York, England. ©                Photo by Ian ForsythGetty ImagesAt a time when Church membership has hit an all-time low in the Western world, it might seem odd that Christian leaders appear more determined than ever to alienate what’s left of their dwindling flock through woke nonsense.In December, for example, the Dean of Trinity College left an assembly of worshippers in tears after he argued that the body of Jesus Christ appeared to be “trans.” Part of the reasoning was due to the wound on his side, made by a Roman spear as the son of God hung dying on the cross, which had a “decidedly vaginal appearance.” I will let the reader make of that what they will.Now, not to be outdone as far as possible heresies go, the Church of England, under pressure from liberal Christians, is considering declaring God gender-neutral. In other words, no more ‘Our Father’ in the Lord’s prayer, while ‘God the Father’ will be a meaningless ‘they’ or ‘them’. This may require some divine intervention, since the very first words of the Old Testament are ‘B’reshit bara Elohim’ – ‘In the beginning God created’. The verb bara (created) agrees with a masculine singular subject. Could it be the case that the Bible – the very word of God – got it all wrong?Read moreJesus Christ could have been transgender – Cambridge DeanIt is important to be clear about one thing: The very foundation of the Christian faith rests on the idea of the Holy Trinity – the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. To ignore that millennia-old teaching is to ignore the very essence of the entire Bible.Rev Ian Paul, a member of the General Synod and the Archbishops’ Council of the Church of England, cautioned against any retreat from the original scriptures, saying:“The fact that God is called ‘Father’ can’t be substituted by ‘Mother’ without changing meaning, nor can it be gender-neutralized to ‘Parent’ without loss of meaning. Fathers and mothers are not interchangeable but relate to their offspring in different ways.“If the Liturgical Commission seeks to change this, then in an important way they will be moving the doctrine of the Church away from being grounded in the Scriptures,” he added.Indeed, terms like ‘Father’ and ‘Mother’ have long been used as a metaphorical way of relating to things that no mere mortal will be able to completely fathom. Earth, for example, has long been depicted as feminine – ‘Mother Earth’ – to better appreciate the bounty and plentitude of its life-bearing gifts.In his poem, ‘Mother Earth’, Henry Van Dyke wrote:Mother of all the high-strung poets and singers departed,Mother of all the grass that weaves over their graves the glory of the field,Mother of all the manifold forms of life, deep-bosomed, patient, impassive,Silent brooder and nurse of lyrical joys and sorrows!In a sense, that is exactly what the liberals are destroying with their incessant desire to wreak havoc on language – the poetical attachment that human beings give to things that are far beyond their limited abilities to comprehend. Now they have taken their mission straight to the pearly gates of heaven, and I’m guessing St. Peter won’t be answering their calls anytime soon. The same thing could be said, by the way, for many of the people who make up the Church of England. After all, it seems to have escaped everyone’s attention that at the same time the woke crusaders invade the sanctity of the church, turning tradition on its head, worshippers are increasingly absent from the pews. Just a coincidence?Read moreChristmas carol rewritten to be more ‘inclusive’This would be a good time for the Church to push back against the idea that people can readily change what the good Lord created. At the same time that some people want to make God gender-neutral,– incidentally, and perhaps coincidentally, one notable unholy deity that has been depicted as ‘gender neutral’ to date is Baphomet, who has acquired a new following in the West of late– there are young children being taught in the classroom that they might have been born into the wrong body. This places them on the path to undergo medical operations to change what many people believe was God’s work.The Church should seize this moment when so many people are confused over their identity and stand firm on the identity of the supreme creator. Let the next generation of youth understand that there are some things in this world that should never be changed.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571296-uk-liberals-gender-neutral-god/,2023,2,11

If so, the Pentagon wants to hear from you so it can amp up its manipulation efforts.US Special Operations Command (US SOCOM) has issued proposal requests for a whole host of dodgy services, according to new documentsobtained by The Intercept.Specifically, the Pentagon is looking for “next generation capability to ‘takeover’ Internet of Things (IoT) devices in order to collect data and information from local populaces to enable a breakdown of what messaging might be popular and accepted through sifting of data once received.”For what purpose? “This would enable MISO [Military Information Support Operations] to craft and promote messages that may be more readily received by the local populace in relevant peernear peer environments,” according to the document.Read moreUS Special Ops want to weaponize deep fakes – The InterceptDespite publicly obsessing over others’ foreign interference and propaganda, Washington is now openly admitting that it is actively seeking these new technologies for its own “influence operations, digital deception, communication disruption, and disinformation campaigns at the tactical edge and operational levels.” You know, exactly the same kind of thing, over which it drums up fear as a threat to freedom and democracy among the general public.Earlier this year, a Washington-based advisory firm OODA published a report warning that Chinese-made household items could not only be spying on you, but basically fronting for the Chinese government. The report’s author called for the British government to act on claims that Chinese-made Internet of Things appliances, and even car components, can collect and transmit data through cellular 5G networks to Chinese companies, which could then be ordered to pass it on to the government.The story was hysterically splashed across British media.OODA describes itself as a “global strategic advisory firm with deep DNA in global security, technology and intelligence issues.” The genetics run deep, indeed: straight to the Pentagon and Western intelligence communities where its executives, experts and advisers have past or current working relationships.So now it looks like calls to ban Chinese household appliances for their spying potential have turned into Washington wanting to get in on the action by obtaining the best possible front row seat as you stand in front of your refrigerator at midnight, chugging chocolate milk straight from the carton.The Pentagon also wants to be able to create “deep fake” videos that can realistically portray fake events as real, in an attempt to manipulate the target viewer(s). Or, as the Pentagon puts it, to “generate messages and influence operations via non-traditional channels in relevant peernear peer environments.” It’s hard to imagine a more glaring example of actual fake news, yet the Pentagon wants to produce it in the way that Netflix makes movies and TV shows.Read moreTwitter pushed the Pentagon’s Middle East war propaganda, and both will likely get away with itFinally, the Pentagon says that they want to get their hands on “a next generation capability to collect disparate data through public and open source information streams such as social media, local media, etc. to enable MISO to craft and direct influence operations and messages in relevant peernear peer environments.”Some might be tempted to just shrug this off as conventional practice because, when the military is tracking down bad guys, they’re obviously going to want to use every possible tool available at their disposal – and constantly seek to expand that tool box. But recent evidence suggests that military-grade collection and subversion tools targeting online and conventional information platforms have largely been turned on the average citizen for the purpose of protecting the establishment and its various narratives from dissent rather than for reasons of national security.Last December, for example, Twitter CEO Elon Musk worked with a journalist to reveal the collusion between US government authorities and the social media platform to manipulate and censor public debate over the Covid-19 pandemic. According to internal Twitter documents, one of the first meetings that the Biden Administration requested with Twitter executives was on the topic of Covid vaccines and specific high-profile accounts that deviated from the official narrative. According to the journalist, David Zweig, “Twitter did suppress views – many from doctors and scientific experts – that conflicted with the official positions of the White House. As a result, legitimate findings and questions that would have expanded the public debate went missing.”He added that, “With Covid, this bias bent heavily toward establishment dogmas,” and cited examples of various experts, including prominent epidemiologists, whose views were censored as a result of being qualified by the Twitter staff as Covid “misinformation.”Earlier this year, a British whistleblower also revealed that critics of Covid-19-related lockdowns and vaccine mandates – including prominent journalists and politicians – were monitored by the UK army’s information warfare brigade. The 77th Brigade, created in 2015 and described by the media at the time as composed of “warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of ‘psyops’”.Read moreThe Red Scare 2.0: Russophobia in America todayThe Canadian military was also caught using propaganda techniques honed on the battlefield in Afghanistan to shape the Covid debate by boosting the government’s narrative and attempting to head off any civil unrest over the harsh mandates.The Pentagon’s latest wish list raises concerns that these tools will also be deployed on average Americans or Westerners for purposes of control and manipulation. Last September, the Pentagon vowed to review its secret psyops, but only after public outrage when a group of researchers suggested collusion between US government entities and American online platforms like Twitter and Facebook to control online narratives with fake accounts.Was the lesson learned to stop deploying psyops on average citizens? Or was it just to do a better job of keeping it secret?Not that there’s any shortage of Western establishment cheerleaders demanding even more psychological manipulation efforts by the US government, if only to counter “disinformation” from foreign adversaries.It seems that we’ve now come to the point where sticking it to Russia and China means actively cheerleading the increasingly militarized efforts by our self-styled defenders of freedom and democracy to brainwash their own people.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572674-us-pentagon-deepfake-propaganda/,2023,3,9

The funding is in addition to undisclosed amounts from billionaire financier Soros and the UK Foreign Office, both of which are listed as donors on its website.Read moreIndia slams 'dangerous' George SorosGDI’s ‘dynamic exclusion list’ features more than 2,000 websites, and the organization’s CEO, Clare Melford, claims that the blacklisting has “had a significant impact on the advertising revenue of these sites.”When GDI analyzed American news sites for potential targeting, Republican lawmakers were outraged to discover that conservative and libertarian sites were considered the “ten riskiest online news sources,” and demanded that the State Department pull its funding.The National Endowment for Democracy told the Washington Times on Tuesday that it “will no longer provide financial support to GDI,” as it “cannot fund anything that focuses on the United States.” A spokesperson for the Global Engagement Center said that its role is to “identify foreign state and non-state disinformation narratives, trends and techniques aimed at undermining… the policies, security or stability of the United States.”Both of the State Department offshoots remain formidable implements of American soft power. In recent months, the National Endowment for Democracy sponsored a gathering of anti-China officials and delegates in Taiwan, and promoted anti-government news outlets during protests in Iran.

Meanwhile, 26% of millennials are using social media to research their health issues.The study found that more than six million people in the UK alone turn to social media for advice on dealing with chronic conditions or general health issues.Gen X (those in their 40s and 50s) and Baby Boomers (those in their 60s and 70s) are less inclined to rely on social media, with only 14% and 5% respectively searching for health information on such platforms.Across all generations, 52% said they have used at least one virtual health tool andor channel more than once.Read moreMusk fires more Twitter staffAmong Gen Z (aged 11-26 years old), TikTok has proven to be the most popular social media app, followed by Instagram and Twitter. Meanwhile, millennials show a preference for Facebook, followed by TikTok and Twitter.The study, conducted between July and September 2022, is based on replies from 10,500 respondents in the US, China, UK, Germany and Japan.The results echo similar research in the US by CharityRx, a discount pharmacy service, which found that one third of Gen Zers consult TikTok for health advice, with another 44% relying on recommendations from YouTube before visiting their doctor.Overall, that survey found that some 20% of Americans seek advice on TikTok before seeing a medical professional.

Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also accused the UK of incorporating the incident into an anti-Russian narrative.In a statement released on Saturday, Zakharova claimed that the British authorities had used the “incident in Salisbury” to “purposely complicate our bilateral relations.” She pointed out that despite Moscow’s repeated calls for “responsible dialogue,” London has so far refused to jointly investigate the poisoning, which targeted Russian nationals.“To date, the UK has not been able to present any reliable information on the ‘Skripal case’,” the spokeswoman said.At the same time, she stated, London “continues to shamelessly use it in its massive anti-Russian campaign.”: Ex-KGB officer in Britain complains of death threatsZakharova went on to reiterate that Moscow insists on a “professional, objective and unbiased investigation,” and strongly condemns London’s attempts to lay the blame at Russia’s doorstep.In 2006, Sergey Skripal, who had previously served in Russia’s foreign military intelligence agency (GRU), was convicted and jailed for handing over state secrets to British intelligence. Four years later, he was pardoned and allowed to move to the UK as part of a spy swap deal.On March 4, 2018, Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious. British authorities established that the two had come into contact with the nerve agent Novichok. They were later confirmed to have recovered.London named three men as suspects, claiming they were Russian agents. Moscow categorically denied any involvement.

They looked into the ways the US embargo – imposed unilaterally in 2018 after Washington reneged on the 2015 nuclear deal – has affected Iranians suffering from thalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder.: Western sanctions will mean that more Syrians die after the earthquakesIran has a “particularly high number” of patients with thalassemia, who require specialized medication during blood transfusions. They are manufactured by the Swiss company Novartis, with components sourced from the French company Roquette Freres, but were “denied to Iran” due to “fear in medical, delivery and insurance business sectors,” the experts said.“The humanitarian exemptions for medical goods in US sanctions regulations are complex and unclear,”Douhan and Okafor said, while Washington imposes high fines on companies selling medication to Iran, which leads to their “over-compliance.”Even when a delivery is authorized, “producers, shippers, insurers, or banks” are reluctant to do business with Iran fearing “aggressive US sanctions enforcement and penalties,” they noted. This has led to “fear, pain and premature death” among thalassemia patients.: Iran retaliates against UN nuclear resolution – mediaOkafor and Douhan called on the US government to remove any obstacles to financial transactions for medical purposes, effectively implement humanitarian exemptions, and not impose secondary sanctions on medical exports to Iran, while urging other UN members to abide by their human rights obligations.The US, UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany struck an agreement with Iran – known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – in 2015, which had Tehran curtail its nuclear energy research in exchange for relief from UN sanctions.

He is also a member of the Russian International Affairs Council.Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual address to the Federal Assembly, including lawmakers of the State Duma, members of the Federation Council, regional governors and other officials, in Moscow, Russia. ©                Sputnik  Maksim BlinovIn his recent landmarkaddress to Russia’s parliament, President Vladimir Putin cited the war in Ukraine and USNATO involvement in the conflict as the main reason for his decision to “suspend” Moscow’s participation in the 2010 New START Treaty on strategic nuclear weapons. Putin also suggestedthat Russia should be ready to resume nuclear testing.Effectively, this announcement, promptly turned into law by the Russian parliament, means a formal end to the long-ailing institutions of strategic arms control that began over 50 years ago. If New START is followed by the CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) and then the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty), strategic deregulation will be complete. Putin’s logic is that the United States cannot be allowed to inspect Russian missile bases while at the same time pursuing a policy of “strategically defeating” Moscowin Ukraine.The Kremlin’s decision was anything but a bolt from the blue. The proxy war in Ukraine came asthe culmination ofa decade-and-a-half-long process of steady deterioration of Russian-American and Russian-EU relations. Ever since it became clear – somewhere in the mid-2000s – that Russia would not fit into the US-dominated order, and that Washington, and its, allies would not let Russia sign upon terms that Moscow would find acceptable, the trajectory of the relationship has generally pointed toward confrontation.True, there was a brief period, which coincided with the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev (2008-12), which witnessed, besides the signing of New START, an attempt to build a strategic partnership between Russia and NATO and modernization and technology partnerships between Russia and key Western countries, including the US and Germany. That attempt, however, turned out to be the last hurrah of the efforts to integrate Russia into, or at least with, the West following the end of the Cold War.Essentially, while Moscow was looking for equal and indivisible security, as well as technology and business opportunities, Washington and Berlin were mostly interested in softening and diluting Russia’s domestic political regime. There was also no question of treating Russian security concerns about NATO’s enlargement seriously: Moscow had to accept the post-Cold War order in which it no longer had a decisive voice. That mismatch of key goals could not last long. Alreadyby2011-12, the outlook for Russia-West relations could be summarized as something like: it will get worse before it gets worse.Right now, we are still on the same trajectory – things can become even more grim than they are now.Read moreAndrey Sushentsov: Here’s why Ukraine’s Zelensky wants a long war with RussiaHopefully, the credible threat of complete annihilation – the heart of nucleardeterrence – will still protect us from the very worst outcome, but the changes wrought by the Ukraine war on the global strategic landscape during its first year are indeed massive. Strategic deregulation between Moscow and Washington has already been highlighted. In practice, this will mean that each party will be free to build, structure, and deploy its strategic forces as it sees fit, and rely on its own so-called national technical means – such as spy satellites and other forms of intelligence – as the prime source of information about the other. It is natural to expect that under such circumstances both parties would have a powerful incentive to engage in worst-case-scenario planning.It is true that of the five 'established' nuclear powers and the four other countries that possess nuclear arms, only two– America and Russia– have historically engaged in nuclear arms control. For years, Washington sought to find ways to link Beijing to the US-Russia strategic dialogue, thus leading toa tripartite arrangement. China, which was never interested in the US offer, is now believed to be in the process of substantially expanding and improving its strategic nuclear forces.Whether and when Beijing will be ready to engage Washington in strategic arms talks is anyone’s guess. After the the USformally designated China as its principal adversary, Sino-American relations have been growing increasingly tense. In any event, managing a strategic equation among the three leading nuclear powers, one of which regards the other two as its adversaries, will now become more difficult.Strategic deregulation is not just the absence of binding treaties. It is also likely to mean the unraveling of the conceptual framework for arms control, which was originally developed by the Americans in the 1960s and then accepted by the Soviet Union. Any future arrangements among the world’s nuclear powers – whenever it comes – will require a wholly new concept that might be based on the agreed-upon and mutually fitting elements developed by the participating countries, with their vastly different strategic environments and cultures. It will certainly be a most daunting task.Read moreFyodor Lukyanov: US-China trade is surging as military tensions escalate, what exactly is going on?Putin’s angry reaction to NATO’s call for Russia to observe New START and let US inspectors in has opened up another relatively minor issue: the nuclear weapons of Britain and France. The Soviet Union had long insisted on including those two countries’ nuclear arsenals in the US ceilings, and only relented during Gorbachev’s perestroika. With Paris and London taking an active role in the proxy war in Ukraine, Moscow is no longer pretending that UK and French nuclear forces are there solely to defend their own countries. They are seen as part of the combined arsenal of the adversarial, US-led West. This is no big deal for the moment, but any conceivable future arrangement would have to address the issue of the Anglo-French forces.In geopolitical terms, the war in Ukraine energized Washington to build a global coalition to oppose Russia. This is often presented as a major achievement of the administration of President Joe Biden. Yet, to look at this from a different perspective, the Russia (and China) policies of the three successive US administrations – Obama’s, Trump’s, and particularly Biden’s– have led to a major split among the great powers that widened from competition to bitter rivalry (with China) and proxy war (with Russia in Ukraine).US efforts to get China to distance itself from Russia appear ridiculousin a situation where Washington’s strategy appears to be to defeatcontainitstwo main adversaries one by one, and, moreover,to pitthem against each other. The famous Kissingerian triangle is now pointed in a different direction: it is Washington that has the worst possible relations with the other two. As for Moscow and Beijing, they are getting even closer as a result.Closer cooperation and coordination between China and Russia amid the war in Ukraine,which is gradually emerging on the platform of common strategic interests, represents a major shift in the world power balance. What is more – andwhat goes well beyond the usual Western concept of 'great power competition'– is the rise of over a hundred actors of different caliber in many parts of the world that have refused to support the US,and its allies, on the Russia sanctions and have maintained or even expanded their trade and other relations with Moscow. These countries insist on following their own national interests as they see them and seek to expand their foreign policy autonomy. At the end of the day, this phenomenon – call it the Rise of the Global Majority (no longer silent) – could be the single most important development so far en route to the new world order.ANALYSIS                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571927-war-reshaping-world-order/,2023,2,24

The day before, Polish President Andrzej Duda declared that his country would donate its entire fleet of MiG-29s.In a post on Facebook, Nad stated that a Polish official had approached him at a meeting of EU defense ministers in Sweden on Wednesday, confirming that Warsaw would agree to the joint provision of the jets to Ukraine.In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Duda said that his country “stands ready to provide these planes.”However, Duda has made similar statements before. In an interview with Sky News last month, he called on NATO to provide Ukraine with modern jets at some point in the future, but said that older MiGs could be sent in the meantime. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said a day later that Warsaw was “ready” for such a transfer, but would only do so as part of “a coalition with the United States as a leader.”Read morePentagon trying to fit US missiles to Ukrainian jets – PoliticoIn his Facebook post, Nad wrote that “it’s time to make a decision” on sending the planes, suggesting that both countries were still waiting for a green light from the US. However, Washington has indicated it is unlikely to give permission.Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said on Tuesday that his government was “ready to deploy” the country’s entire fleet of MiG-29s to the US air base at Ramstein, Germany, from where they would be transferred to Ukraine. The Pentagon rejected this proposal, saying it was “not tenable.”The Polish Air Force has 29 MiG-29s in active service, while Slovakia has 12 in storage.Kiev has repeatedly requested both Soviet- and Western-made planes from its NATO backers. While the US-led bloc has yet to yield to these requests, the UK announced last month that it would train Ukrainian pilots on “sophisticated NATO-standard fighter jets,” and the US is reportedly evaluating Ukrainian pilots’ suitability for training on US-made F-16 combat aircraft.Russia has maintained that the influx of Western weapons into Ukraine will prolong the conflict without altering its outcome.

CNN previously reported, citing sources, that the Pacific nation intended to buy at least four subs of this class.While nuclear-powered subs do not necessarily carry nuclear weapons, they can stay underwater for longer than conventional ones and are harder to detect.Read moreAustralia vows to protect US nuclear ‘crown jewels’One Reuters source claimed that the AUKUS agreement would consist of several stages spanning into the late 2030s, and would see at least one US submarine visit Australian ports in the coming years. Two US officials told the agency that after those visits, Washington would forward deploy some submarines in Western Australia by around 2027.Another key element of the deal would be the development of a new unidentified submarine class according to British designs, but with the use of American tech, the report says.This echoes a Guardian report on Wednesday claiming that British Prime Minister Sunak was “enthusiastic” about the upcoming agreement, with the outlet’s sources suggesting that the UK “had succeeded in its bid to sell British-designed nuclear submarines to Australia.”The pledge to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines was the cornerstone of the AUKUS deal first announced in 2021 and widely regarded as a challenge to China. Beijing has repeatedly criticized the pact, arguing that it involves the “illegal transfer of nuclear weapon materials, making it essentially an act of nuclear proliferation.”However, China is not the only country unhappy about AUKUS. By joining the pact with the US and UK, Australia scrapped a multibillion-dollar order for French submarines, leaving Paris furious.Relations between the two countries frayed to the point that ex-French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described Canberra’s decision as a “stab in the back,” while French President Emmanuel Macron accused former Australian PM Scott Morrison of lying.

Noting that Lavrov was visiting Mali and Eritrea, Borrell called them “easy countries” for Moscow to “spread lies about who is guilty for what is happening” in Ukraine.“So speaks a man who can’t hide the racist essence of his worldview,” Lavrov said when asked about his EU counterpart’s accusations. “Not so long ago he openly spoke about Europe being a garden surrounded by a jungle that threatens it, so the garden needs to be careful with the jungle. That says it all about who actually relates to the needs and interests of African countries, and how.”“We have nothing to hide or to be ashamed of,” the Russian foreign minister added. “We were at the source of Africa’s liberation from the colonial yoke. The Soviet Union was one of the main initiators of the declaration to grant independence to colonized countries and peoples in 1960.

Bidders trying to secure military aid contracts through thescheme are frustrated at how slowly the British Defense Ministry is reviewing their applications, the Guardian reported on Monday.Of the £520 million ($624 million) pledged to the fund by the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Lithuania, only £200 million ($240 million) has so far been allocated, the newspaper reported. Some participants now fear the delays could mean some of the weapons not reaching the Ukrainian frontline until summer.The fund was initially launched in August as a “flexible low-bureaucracy fund” that would provide equipment, training and money for Ukraine’s armed forces. However, the British Ministry of Defense, which is in charge of overseeing the project, has admitted that awarding contracts “inevitably took time.”According to the Guardian, over 1,500 suppliers are understood to have submitted bids, cumulatively worth over £27 billion. But some of the bidders claim the number of offers has overwhelmed the fund’s secretariat, which one supplier suggested was staffed by only two people.Speaking to the Guardian, a source within the British Defense Ministry insisted that there is a larger team working on reviewing the bids, but admitted that the high level of interest was a “complicating factor.”Read moreContents of latest Ukraine weapons package revealedAt the same time, the ministry source insisted that the fund was never intended to be a traditional competitive bidding process, and that the MoD wanted to ensure that it was properly managed in a way that helped Ukraine.“Ensuring the first round was successful meant we refined the possible purchases from the fund. This inevitably took time,” the source said.Meanwhile, the UK has reportedly been pushing Ukraine towards negotiating with Moscow, with the promise of even more advanced Western weapons to be provided to Kiev’s forces, as well as security guarantees from NATO. According to the Wall Street Journal, the British proposal has been backed by France and Germany, which have already advised Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to make “difficult decisions.”Moscow has repeatedly urged the West to stop sending weapons to Ukraine, arguing it only serves to prolong the conflict and will lead to more bloodshed. Russia has also suggested that the West’s increasing military support to Kiev is turning the US and its NATO partners into participants in the conflict.

The decision may come despite US President Joe Biden recently stating that Washington would not send F-16 fighter jets to Kiev.According to American officials cited in the report, they “are likely to provide Ukraine with more sophisticated air power as the war drags on.” Another possible solution is to greenlight the re-export of F-16s to Ukraine from other nations.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the issue of jet deliveries is slated to be discussed during a meeting of NATO defense ministers on Tuesday. However, two people familiar with the matter also told FT that sending warplanes to Kiev is “a longer-term objective,” which is much less pressing than providing it with ammunition.One US official echoed that sentiment, describing fighter jets as “less important in the near term,” while stressing that the West now has to concentrate on boosting Ukraine’s air defenses.Read moreRussia cautions against Western warplanes for Kiev“They’ll do that [protect air space] through air defense artillery, equipped with the proper ammunition. Fighter jets are not and will not be as capable against the Russian air force as an integrated air defense system,” he said.The report underscores concerns voiced by Stoltenberg on Monday, who stated that Ukraine is consuming an “enormous amount” of ammunition, with the Western defense industry struggling to keep up with the demand.In recent weeks, several Western countries committed to support Kiev with heavy tanks. Still, US President Joe Biden signaled that he would not indulge Ukraine’s requests for fighter jets, saying that Washington should keep its F-16s stateside.Last week, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky doubled down on his pleas for Western-made weapons, particularly combat aircraft, during his visits to the UK and France.While French President Emmanuel Macron said that he “is not ruling anything out,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said that London has no immediate plans to dispatch its warplanes. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also thus far refused to send fighters to Kiev.The reluctance is partly based on widespread concerns that Ukraine could use the warplanes to attack targets inside Russia, potentially escalating the conflict.Russia has repeatedly warned the West against supplying Ukraine with arms, arguing it would only prolong the conflict. Moscow also believes that weapons shipments make the West a direct party to the hostilities.                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571443-us-jets-ukraine-considered/,2023,2,14

The Syrian government has detained about 8,000 ISIS-affiliated women and children since the terrorist group’s defeat in 2019. Adult male ISIS members are held in separate camps.“We are being forced to have sex with the ISIS women, to impregnate them,” two teens identified as Ahmet, 13, and Hamid, 14, told a guard at Camp al-Hawl. “Can you get us out of here?” One of the boys was required to have sex with eight ISIS women in just a few days.Read more‘ISIS bride’ loses citizenship appealSecurity forces confirmed that teen boys at Camp al-Roj, also in northeastern Syria, had been subjected to similar exploitation, the Daily Beast said. In fact, one of the boys collapsed and was hospitalized after being given a Viagra-like substance to make him perform. Mothers at al-Roj, seeking to protect their sons from sexual enslavement, have begged camp authorities to transfer their boys to rehabilitation centers.Syrian defense officials have recently adopted a policy of moving boys who have reached puberty to such rehabilitation facilities, where they receive anti-extremism counseling and are prepared for reintegration into society. The United Nations decried the policy last week, calling it “unlawful” and suggested that they may be “forcibly disappeared” or sold.Many of the ISIS women have refused repatriation to their home countries for themselves and their children.

The legislation, which will be launched this week, comes as part of the government’s pledge to ""tackle illegal migration.""""Illegal migration is not fair on British taxpayers, it is not fair on those who come here legally and it is not right that criminal gangs should be allowed to continue their immoral trade,"" Sunak said in an interview with the Mail on Sunday. ""So, make no mistake, if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay.""Provisionally titled the Illegal Migration Bill, the new law will seek to make asylum claims by people who enter the country with the use of small vessels inadmissible by British law.

Human rights campaigners have also been heavily critical of the plan.Asylum-seekers looking to gain entry to the UK have rights protected by the UN’s Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Illegal Migration Bill will have a ""rights break,"" which would effectively circumvent the UN’s refugee convention, according to the Mail on Sunday.Critics of the legislation say that the law will not prevent illegal entry, but instead result in thousands of asylum seekers being detained at huge expense to the UK taxpayer.

The Cheshire Constabulary announced the charges on Wednesday.The youths were arrested on Sunday and remain anonymous, though the female suspect reportedly hails from Warrington and the male lives in Leigh. Police stressed that “there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice” the “fair trial” to which they are entitled.While Detective Chief Superintendent Mike Evans told reporters on Sunday the attack on Ghey was “targeted” and that investigators were probing the hate crime angle, he clarified that “at this time there is no evidence to suggest that the circumstances surrounding Brianna’s death are hate related.” It is not known whether the two suspects were acquainted with Ghey.Read moreLondon vetoes Scotland’s new transgender lawEmergency services were summoned to Linear Park Saturday afternoon when passersby discovered Ghey’s body bearing multiple stab wounds on a footpath in the former railway crossing.

The US is the main roadblock to a peace treaty            FILE PHOTO: Japanese demonstrate in Tokyo streets on April 8, 2022 in Tokyo, Japan. ©                David MAREUIL  Anadolu Agency via Getty Images“Give back the Northern Territories! You’re illegally occupying our land!” Every year, on February 7, slogans like this blare out through loudspeakers opposite the Russian embassy in Japan. This is the day when Japan celebrates the so-called Northern Territories Day."" Thisrefers to what Russia calls the Southern Kurils — Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai Islands, — which became part of the Soviet Union after World War 2.In 2022, a protest staged by rightwing radicals began a day early and resulted in unrest. According to Russian diplomats, “a group of militant young men'' attempted to break into the embassy premises and fought with police securing the entrance. The next day, on February 7, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida addressed a national rally in Tokyo calling for the return of the Northern Territories.Read moreThe Fight for Ugledar: Why controlling a small town in southwestern Donbass is so important for the Russian militaryThis year has been no exception. Far-right activists again staged a rally outside the building, making a detour around the perimeter of the block in vans and using loudspeakers to shout their demands for the return of the islands. In addition, for the first time since 2018, the phrase “illegal occupation” was included in the statement that is traditionally read out at the end of the annual ‘National Rally for the Return of the Northern Territories’.Tokyo ties the Kuril Islands dispute with another issue that has been souring relations with Moscow for almost 78 years — the absence of a peace treaty between the two capitalsafter World War Two. On March 21, 2022, Russia exited the negotiation process with Japan, which had been gaining momentum since the end of the Cold War. The Russian Foreign Ministry stated it was impossible to hold such discussions with a state that “displays an openly unfriendly position and attempts to damage the interests of our country.”This came after Tokyo placed sanctions on Moscow.The Southern Kuril Islands are a very valuable asset. The Catherine and Vries Straits are the only year-round ice-free links between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean. Additionally, the Sea of Okhotsk can be considered an internal sea of the Russian Federation, thus preventing any other country from fishing or extracting mineral resources there without Moscow’s permission. The area around the Southern Kuril Islands boasts rich fishing grounds, where the USSR used to catch most of its Japanese pilchard and Pacific saury. Iturup has one of the world’s largest deposits of rhenium, a remarkably rare metal. A major underwater hydrocarbon deposit has been discovered off the coast of the Lesser Kuril Chain, with reserves in the Mid-Kuril Oil and Gas Basin estimated at 300 million tons.                       © Wikipedia                                                        Pursuing sanctions and KurilsWhat little hope there was to sign a peace treaty endedafterTokyo’s response to Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, has counted 15 packages of individual and sectoral sanctions imposed by Japan over this time. “Sometimes Japan was even overzealous, rushing new sanctions before its Western allies,” she added.Any hypothetical resumption of talks can only happen after the whole crisis around Ukraine is resolved, Vladimir Nelidov, an associate professor of Eastern Studies at MGIMO, told RT.While the [conflict]is ongoing, no talks and certainly no resolution are possible. This issue is part of the bigger context of the relations between Russia and the West, which are currently involved in a confrontation,” he said.Read moreThe Maidan sniper killings were pivotal for the 2014 Kiev coup –why is research into the massacre being censored in the West?Although located off Asia’s Pacific Coast, Japan coordinates its policies with its allies in the West.Valery Kistanov, Head of the Center for Japanese Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of China and Contemporary Asia, told RT:“A peace treaty is very unlikely in the foreseeable future, I’m not even sure the next generations will live to see it. Relations with Japan are so bad now, a peace treaty is not on the table. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is still talking about his willingness to keep negotiating, even though Japan is one of the global leaders in this whole anti-Russian business. I’m certain that this course will remain for decades or even centuries to come. Russia can’t abide by that.”Meanwhile, Japan seems determined to continue maintaining sanctions pressure on Russia. In the latest package to date, it banned exports of vaccines, medical equipment, and robots and expanded sanctions against individuals. In response, Moscow put Japan on the list of unfriendly countries, suspended peace talks, and stopped joint economic activities on the Kuril Islands and visa-free travel for Japanese citizens to the Kuril Islands last year. In 2023, Russia followed up by refusing to hold annual talks with Japan over fishing near the islands under a 1998 treaty.“Essentially, the only thing left is the energy bridge. Japan decided not to quit the Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 projects because it badly needs resources, and there is no alternative. Otherwise, Japan’s whole energy sector will go under,” Kistanov says. According to him, in all other respects, the countries’ relations have ground to a halt.

The USSR, in its turn, pledged to join the war on the eastern front no later than two or three months after defeating Nazi Germany. The Southern Kurils were taken by Soviet forces in August-September 1945 and officially declared a part of the USSR a year later.Read moreControversial coup leader & US ally: Who was ex-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf?Japan confirmed that it renounced all claims to the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin when it signed the Treaty of San Francisco, yet the text of the treaty drafted by the US and Great Britain neither said who it renounced those territories to, nor listed the names of the specific islands. Nevertheless, Tokyo gave up the ability to have a say in the future of the territories because all of the 48 treaty signatory states could then also lay claim to them.Those provisions and the absence of the People’s Republic of China at the conference led the Soviet delegation to refuse to sign the Peace Treaty of San Francisco.At first, it would appear that Japan was resigned to losing the territories. Kumao Nishimura, chief of the Treaty Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, described the loss of Kunashir and Iturup in the Japanese parliament as a fait accompli. However, Washington, which was waging a cold war against Moscow by that time, was bent on creating a territorial problem for its competitor. When discussing the treaty, the US Senate adopted a resolution which refused to accept any Soviet rights or claims to territories that belonged to Japan on December 7, 1941, including the Kuril Islands and even South Sakhalin.Soon enough, Tokyo found new grounds to dispute the Southern Kurils.

Tokyo’s demands were very ambitious at first – approving Japan’s UN membership and returning all the territories that were under Japan’s control in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, including Southern Sakhalin and all the Kuril Islands. The Soviet Union’s proposal included giving Tokyo control over Shikotan and the Habomai Islands if Japan agreed to give up all future territorial demands. Shunichi Matsumoto, who represented Japan at the talks, later shared that he “couldn’t believe what he heard” at first and “greatly rejoiced”.Read moreLast bow for ‘The Last Emperor’: The Russian MMA colossus preparing for his final battleAfter several rounds, Japan narrowed its demands down to the four South Kuril Islands. Their reasoning was that historically these four islands weren’t considered part of the Kurils, and therefore were not covered by the Treaty of San-Francisco. This was totally in line with US interests, since America didn’t want the agreement to be broken, but it also didn’t want the Soviet Union to have control over the two Kuril Islands. Washington benefited from Tokyo gaining control over all four islands, but the Soviet Union wouldn’t budge.When Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu made his recommendation to the Japanese government to accept Moscow’s proposal and agree to the transfer of the two islands, the country’s leadership didn’t like it. Deputy Cabinet Secretary Takizo Matsumoto commented, “Moscow influenced him, and the Cabinet decided to send him to London, where he could meet with the [US] Secretary of State”.At the talks in the UK capital, the US delegation threatened their colleagues from Tokyo, reminding them that they had no legal rights to the Kuril Islands and could not discuss their status with the USSR. On August 19, 1956, State Secretary John Dulles told Shigemitsu that if an agreement between Moscow and Tokyo were to be reached,Japan might tell the Soviet Union of the tough line the United States was taking – that if the Soviet Union were to take all the Kurils, the United States might remain forever in Okinawa, and no Japanese Government could survive.”This thinly veiled threat, disguised as “a friendly recommendation” effectively brought the Soviet-Japanese talks on the Kuril Islands to a halt.Read more‘There is no God here’: How conflict between the Orthodox Christian Church and the Soviet Union helped define modern RussiaThe Ryukyu Islands were seized by US troops in 1945, with its largest island, Okinawa, remaining under American control until 1972. Today, the US maintains military bases there.“Japan was under American pressure back in the 1950s, of course, and there is no consensus among historians to this day as to how that incident should be construed. But one thing we know for sure – the US was not interested in letting the Soviet Union normalize its relations with Japan, even if pro-US political forces in Japan were not opposed to restoring relations with the Soviets,” Vladimir Nelidov explained.However, despite America’s best efforts, the USSR and Japan did sign a joint declaration in Moscow in 1956, formally putting an end to the state of war between the two countries. Moreover, the Soviet Union pledged to return the Habomai Islands and Shikotan to Japan, but only after a peace treaty was signed.This generous gesture, however, was overshadowed by the US concluding a new treaty of mutual cooperation and security with Tokyo, giving it the right to establish and use military bases on Japanese soil, as well as deploy any number of troops there. This practically meant that any Soviet territories returned to Japanese jurisdiction could be used for American military bases. Therefore, the USSR chose to annul the Joint Declaration with Japan in 1960.

Years later, in 2018, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Putin agreed to resume talks based on the 1956 declaration. However, the Japanese leadership still interpreted the document, which only mentioned two of the four islands, in a very peculiar manner. Tokyo would never abandon its plans to get back all the four islands. Besides, it was not going to meet the requirement to recognize Russia’s sovereignty over the Kuril Islands.Read more'This conflict will fundamentally change Russia': A young Muscovite explains why he volunteered to fight UkraineIn January 2023, during a press conference, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recalled that period of active negotiating, led by Prime Minister Abe:“At some point, the Japanese said they didn’t need the “big” peace treaty that Russia was offering… We had proposed signing a comprehensive peace treaty that would outline the principles of cooperation based on mutual respect, mutual interests, and neighborliness. The peace treaty was also supposed to cover investment, economic and humanitarian cooperation. All that was supposed to serve as a basis to define the border. The Japanese turned our proposal down saying they needed a document that’s strictly to the point, not a superfluous treaty full of rhetoric.”According to Valery Kistanov, Putin sincerely believed that a peace treaty was a necessity – and that’s what the diplomatic thaw during Abe’s term was about. The leaders of Russia and Japan held a total of 27 meetings, but the United States got involved in that too.According to Vladimir Nelidov, after 2014, President Obama “took a stand against Russia and Japan’s cooperation.”“For example, in 2016, Obama asked Prime Minister Abe to cancel his visit to Russia, but Abe didn’t listen. The United States has been a negative influence on this relationship more often than not, and now especially so.”Today, the USignores the Treaty of San-Francisco. On the occasion of Japan’s Northern Territories Day in 2022, US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel openly said that Washington fully backs Tokyo.Japan’s new government has made its position crystal clear and is sticking to its narrative of “four illegally occupied islands” that, in its opinion, Russia must return prior to signing a peace treaty.Kistanov concludes, “As far as I see it, Russia doesn’t even need a peace treaty with Japan. We’ve lived for 70 years without one, and can keep on doing just that. We’ve always been accommodating and supportive of any effort to find a compromise, but Japan has never responded in the same way and I believe we shouldn’t expect it. Foreign Minister Lavrov recently quoted one expert on Japan who said, ‘should one day Japan decide that they are not getting back these four islands, it’ll join the club of Russia’s most fierce opponents.’ And that’s exactly what’s happening today.”ByMaxim Hvatkov,a Russian journalist focusing on international security, China's politics and soft-power tools.Feature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571050-russia-and-japan-peace-treaty/,2023,2,7

Therefore, a complete ban on contraceptives is not right.”Since seizing control of Afghanistan amid the withdrawal of US forces in August 2021, the Taliban has prohibited girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from many jobs and public spaces.

However, he did not rule out aircraft deliveries.""The military actions in Ukraine is something where one can never absolutely rule out anything,"" he said, while adding that thisdoes not apply to German military aircraft at the moment.The German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) currently relies mainly on Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. The Air Force (Luftwaffe) has over 140of these aircraft, according to a 2021 report by Airbus. Produced since the early 1990s, these fourth-generation fighter jets are produced jointly by the UK’s BAE Systems, Airbus, and Italy’s Leonardo. Apart from Typhoons, the German Air Force also has nearly 90 older Panavia Tornado jets developed in the 1970s.In January, Pistorius ruled out the idea of Germany sending fighter jets to Ukraine, saying it was ""out of the question.""

An amendment emphasizing that the move does not represent a divergence from existing Church doctrine, which does not permit same-sex marriage, was added during the process.Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell stressed that “no one has to offer these services and no one will be disadvantaged if they don’t,” according to the BBC.Read moreChurch of England discusses gender-neutral GodBishops announced the result with a call for proposals for same-sex blessings, which will be outlined in a publication titled 'Prayers of Love and Faith' to be issued by the House of Bishops later this year after some editing.

Same-sex couples will still not be able to actually get married in the church, which upset those hoping for full equality under religious law.The Synod’s compromise “falls short of what we ultimately believe is the only outcome for radical inclusion - equal marriage for all people,” chair of the Church’s Campaign for Equal Marriage Nigel Pietroni told The Guardian.The Evangelical Council lamented that the Church had rejected its “historical and biblical understanding of sex and marriage,” arguing the vote had “settled nothing and has only served to deepen divisions.” The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches also skewered the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and questioned his “fitness to lead.”The Church of England last month published a formal apology to the LGBTQ community for its previous “hostile and homophobic response” to same-sex couples, saying it repents for the “shameful” behavior.House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt wrote to the bishops last month urging “parishes and clergy to conduct weddings for same-sex couples, or at a minimum, authorize blessings.”                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571251-church-england-gay-marriage-blessings/,2023,2,9

The politician, who has held the position since 2014, made public the decision to step down during a press conference at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, on Wednesday.“Today I am announcing my intention to step down as first minister and leader of my party,” Sturgeon said, adding that she will be acting in a caretaker capacity until a new leader is nominated by the Scottish parliament and approved by King Charles III.Describing her time in office, Sturgeon said her role was the “very best job in the world” and something that had sustained her through the “toughest hours in toughest days.” She said that it is important for a politician to know “almost instinctively when the time is right to make way for someone else.”“My decision comes from a place of duty and love,” the outgoing first minister explained, insisting that it was not the result of “short term pressures,” but rather a “deeper and longer term assessment.”The politician noted that while she could go on, this would not be “right for the country, for my party and for the independence cause.”Speaking of her successor, Sturgeon expressed confidence that the person “will lead Scotland to independence.”Earlier, a source close to Sturgeon told the BBC that she had “had enough.”: Transgender double rapist not a threat to female inmates – prison authorityAs recently as last weekend, the Sunday Times cited an opinion poll as finding that four in ten Scots believed the incumbent first minister had to step down.Sturgeon’s attempts to push through gender recognition reform is the main source of public dissatisfaction, the paper claimed.Last month, the UK government intervened to block the controversial piece of legislation that sought to make it easier for Scots to change their gender on official documents.The bill would allow people to do so after just three months of living as their desired gender. Anyone over 16 seeking gender reassignment would not require a psychiatric diagnosis or any other form of verification.Opponents argued that if implemented, the new rules would put women in female prisons, hospitals, and other facilities at significant risk of sexual harassment and violence.Sturgeon, who came to power following Scotland’s independence referendum back in 2014, had firmly stood by her plans.

McCallum insisted that MI5 has made “more than 100 improvements” since the bombing, which killed 22 people attending an Ariana Grande concert at the arena, claiming the agency “continually” works to improve and vowing to “do more.”The nature of MI5’s information on Abedi remains secret for national security reasons. The first item was considered unlikely to have uncovered Abedi’s plot, but had it been handled differently, it could have “increased the overall prospect that the attack would have been prevented” by the time the second item arrived, the inquiry states. It blames the MI5 officer who received the data for failing to “act swiftly enough.” The report revealed that Abedi was not under active investigation despite having traveled to Libya several times with relatives during that nation’s civil war and despite having previously been flagged by MI5 computers.While MI5 initially released a statement claiming officers had overlooked the intelligence because they thought the information related to criminal activity rather than terrorism, Saunders denied that excuse “present[ed] an accurate picture” and accused the agency of attempting to retrospectively justify not acting on it. In reality, he said, MI5’s northwestern investigative branch was “struggling to cope” with the sheer number of investigations it had open, and agents worried something would fall through the cracks.

However, subsequent evidence pointed to the virus spreading in other areas of China as early as October 2019, before the first Wuhan cases were detected– and researchers believe some cases also occurred in Europe and the US in the last months of 2019.A recent investigation by the US Department of Energy concluded the virus may have been “leaked” from a Chinese lab. Beijing has countered that the World Health Organization’s own investigation found it “extremely unlikely” the Wuhan lab was the source of the outbreak.Rats are far from alone in their susceptibility to the virus that causes Covid-19. Some 17 million mink were preemptively exterminated in Denmark in 2020 after some were found to be infected with a new strain of the virus thought to menace humans, a decision later determined to be illegal.Last year, Hong Kong ordered the culling of 2,000 imported hamsters after a resident’s Covid-19 infection was traced to his handling them in a pet shop; a ban on owning foreign hamsters was only lifted in January.And it was recently revealed that the UK government nearly ordered the mass extermination of residents’ pet cats in order to “flatten the curve” after a Siamese was found to have contracted the virus in 2020, despite next to nothing being known about how the disease was transmitted between species.

The political decision is there… The politicians sent their military to the depots only to find that their tanks are not operational or repaired for delivery to Ukraine,” he said.According to Wallace, NATO has to face the painful truth that “our armies have been more or less hollowed out over the last 30 years… There are numbers of how many tanks each country has. But then there is the reality that tells us that far too few of them are operational,” he noted.When asked whether the tanks would arrive in Ukraine on time, the British defense chief made a call to“give the other partners a little more time,” describing Western-made armor as “not a silver bullet to win the war instantly” and highlighting the importance of training Kiev’s troops.Read moreScholz issues tank pleaWallace went on to say that similar issues apply to ammunition. “In terms of ammunition stocks, too, we found that our peacetime plans were not sufficient.

Can you imagine what would have happened if we had wanted to do that?”""There was an idea at one moment that we may have to ask the public to exterminate all the cats in Britain.""Former Health Minister Lord Bethell discusses the early government response to the Covid pandemic. pic.twitter.comYWyp32zPML— Channel 4 News (@Channel4News) March 1, 2023While Bethell noted that “for a moment” there was “a bit of evidence around that,” he said the matter was investigated and quickly “closed down” – meaning UK residents would not have to euthanize their beloved pets.Officials were wary about the potential spread from animals after a Siamese cat became the first in Britain to contract the coronavirus, with cat owners later warned not to kiss their pets and to “observe very careful hygiene” around them, according to Margaret Hosie, who led a government screening program.: Why is the Covid-19 lab leak theory back in the headlines?Other nations, including Poland and Denmark, were also concerned about animal-borne transmission, with the latter country ordering a cull of a mink population thought to be carrying the virus.

His comments to the UK’s Channel 4 News come after the leak of tens of thousands of WhatsApp messages, shedding light on the government’s response in the early months of the pandemic. Hancock has come under fire for allegedly disregarding advice from England’s top medical officer, Chris Whitty, to test all residents entering care homes.

The meter-sized object struck the surface of the atmosphere above the French city of Rouen, and created a stunning ‘shooting star’ effect over the English Channel.The European Space Agency (ESA) had announced the imminent arrival of the celestial rock on Sunday night. It was only the seventh time scientists have accurately predicted an asteroid striking the atmosphere.The International Meteor Organization added that the object would land around 2.5 miles from the French coast near the port city of Rouen and that it would create a “fireball” or “shooting star” effect visible to the naked eye at around 3.50am CET on Monday.This is “a sign of the rapid advancements in global asteroid detection capabilities,” the ESA said. The agency added that it expected the rock, which is estimated to have been no bigger than one meter, to “safely strike” the atmosphere, and that there was no threat to life.#Sar2667 depuis Rouen c’est énorme !

Puffin Books and the Dahl estate should be ashamed,” he wrote on Twitter.Though the Roald Dahl Story Company argued that edits to the books were “small and carefully considered,” dozens of changes were spotted in some works, such as ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.’ The public uproar over the alterations appears to have been enough to convince Penguin to change course.“We’ve listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of Roald Dahl’s books and the very real questions around how stories from another era can be kept relevant for each new generation,” Dow said.Dahl penned a long line of well-known children’s books before his death in 1990, among them ‘James and the Giant Peach,’ ‘Matilda’ and ‘The Big Friendly Giant,’ selling some 300 million copies worldwide. However, the author came under fire for anti-semitic remarks made at various pointsin his life, for which his estate apologized in 2020, while passages in some of his novels have been slammed as offensive.

NATO doubles down: Highlights from the Munich Security Conference — RT World News,"        NATO doubles down: Highlights from the Munich Security Conference                        Ukraine dominated the annual gathering, with Western leaders pledging to do more to fight Russia            RIshi Sunak and Olaf Scholz pose for the media ahead of their bilateral meeting at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, February 18, 2023 Ahead of the first anniversary of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, Western leaders, diplomats, officials, and spies are gathered in Munich this weekend to discuss their ongoing efforts to prop up Kiev’s military.Running from Friday to Sunday, the Munich Security Conference is a global affair, attended by guests from more than 100 countries. However, this year’s conference mostly focused on Ukraine, with President Vladimir Zelensky urging his Western backers to provide more “modern weapons,” and the leaders of the UK, France, and Germany seemingly eager to meet his demands.Sunak doubles downRead moreOlga Sukharevskaya: How the West has long planned to use Ukraine to fight a proxy war with RussiaSpeaking at the conference on Friday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called on Western leaders to give Ukraine “advanced, NATO-standard capabilities.” Now is the time to “double down” on military support for Kiev, he added, no matter the cost in “blood and treasure.”The UK is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the US, with London committing £2.3 billion ($2.77 billion) to Kiev’s forces last year. In addition to training 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers and pilots this year, Sunak recently announced that the UK would send 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, along with the country’s entire stock of AS90 artillery guns.Russian President Vladimir Putin is “betting we will lose our nerve,” Sunak said, promising that the UK would “prove him wrong” by increasing the supply of artillery ammunition, armored vehicles, and air defense systems. However, reports suggest that the flow of weapons to Ukraine has left British stockpiles depleted.Germany takes the lead on tanksGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on allies to send Ukraine Leopard 2 main battle tanks from their own stockpiles. Berlin has been “intensively campaigning” for this since it gave operators of the Leopards permission to export them to Ukraine last month, he claimed.Scholz’s position marks a dramatic turnaround, given that his government initially refused to authorize delivery of the tanks. Berlin relented in the face of a pressure campaign from its allies, but these allies have since tempered their enthusiasm. Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, and Türkiye have outright refused to donate their Leopards, and Finland – which led the “free the Leopards” campaign to pressure Germany – only promised to train Ukrainian soldiers on the tanks.:    Lavrov challenges French neocolonialism claimsCanada, Norway, Portugal, and Poland are among the few other states that have agreed to supply Leopards, though German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius acknowledged this week that they had only assembled “half a battalion” so far.Macron balks at ‘regime change’French President Emmanuel Macron declared on Friday that Paris does not seek “regime change” in Moscow, a position not shared by his allies in Kiev.“When I hear a lot of people advocating for regime change, I would just ask them: for which change? Who’s next? We experienced several times in the past decade a lot of regime change in a lot of countries. It’s a total failure,” Macron said.Macron has maintained contact with Putin since the military operation in Ukraine began, and has cautioned the West against trying to force “humiliating” peace terms on Russia. However, he has continued to provide Kiev’s forces with progressively heavier weapons, including infantry fighting vehicles and artillery guns.Stoltenberg offers hope of NATO membershipRead moreNo military winner likely in Ukraine conflict –top US generalUkraine can join NATO, but only if it “prevails as a sovereign, independent state,” Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated on Saturday.This condition is in line with NATO’s membership rules, and with the bloc’s 2008 declaration that Ukraine and Georgia would become members at an undetermined point in the future.In the meantime, Stoltenberg pledged to continue funneling military aid to Kiev, arguing that while this support “risks triggering escalation,” the “biggest risk of all is if Putin wins.”Russia has repeatedly warned that Western military aid to Ukraine will only prolong the conflict without changing its outcome. In a social media post on Saturday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wrote that Stoltenberg’s statement shows his “hate and fear,” as well as his willingness to risk “a third world war.”Blinken and Beijing go head-to-headUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Vice President Kamala Harris are expected to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi this weekend. The meeting will be the first face-to-face encounter since the US shot down an alleged “Chinese surveillance balloon” earlier this month.China insisted that the craft was a “civilian airship” and condemned Washington for “overreacting” by sanctioning six Chinese companies. Beijing also accused the US of sending its own surveillance balloons into Chinese airspace.The meeting also comes at a time of increased tension between the rival superpowers, with the US reportedly sending a top military official to Taiwan on Friday.Recap                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571709-munich-security-conference-highlights/,2023,2,18
Seymour Hersh explains why he believes US blew up Nord Stream — RT World News,"        Seymour Hersh explains why he believes US blew up Nord Stream                        Political reasons drove the decision to detonate the charges, says the investigative journalist            Journalist Seymour Hersh talks to Afshin Rattansi ©                Going UndergroundscreenshotUS President Joe Biden ordered the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines in order to make sure Germany could not change its mind about sanctions against Russia and weapons shipments to Ukraine, according to Seymour Hersh. The legendary investigative journalist was speaking to ‘Going Underground.’Earlier this month, Hersh published an article that blamed the US and Norway for the series of explosions that disabled both Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, the pipelines under the Baltic Sea built to supply Western Europe with Russian natural gas.In an interview with Afshin Rattansi, Hersh said the US intelligence community hatched the plan “in late 2021,” before the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine. When Biden and Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland both publicly spoke about “stopping” and “ending” Nord Stream 2, however, Hersh claimed the spies were upset, “because it was supposed to be a covert operation.”Read moreEvidence of US guilt for Nord Stream ‘more than a smoking gun’ – Russia“The people who did this thing in the intelligence community, they initially thought it was a great idea,” Hersh told Rattansi. According to his story, the bombs were planted in June, during the scheduled BALTOPS 2022 naval exercise off the Danish island of Bornholm. The bombs went off in late September, as Ukraine was facing “a serious issue” on the battlefield.“It’s not going to help the war. What he was doing it for, was to prevent Germany and Western Europe, in case the winter came quickly, from opening up the pipeline,” Hersh said.The rationale for the mission was “to make sure that Europe keeps on supporting NATO and keeps funneling arms into what is clearly a proxy war against Russia that’s being fought right now,” he added.Asked whether Moscow had somehow missed the American involvement, and focused on the UK instead, Hersh said he had not spoken to anyone in Russia. One thing he could say is that it would be “absolutely insane” for Russia to blow up its own pipeline. Just about everyone in the pipeline business agrees with that assessment, he added.The White House, the Pentagon and the State Department have all disavowed Hersh’s article as “fiction” and denied all accusations of US involvement in the attack on Nord Stream. Russia has called for an independent UN investigation into what it described as an act of international terrorism.The full interview will air on Saturday’s episode of Going Underground.

Nevertheless, Pristina continues to claim that 117 countries support its""independence.""In fact, more than half of the countries belonging to the UN do not recognize Kosovo’s independence.

Upon closer examination, it turns out that the vast majority of global statesare dealing with some form of separatist issues, ranging from significant to very minor.A Balkan Patchwork QuiltThe disputed statusof Kosovo is only the latest instance of separatism resulting in the emergence of a new state-like entity in the Balkans. The disintegration of the region has been dubbed ‘Balkanization’, and deservedly so.At the end of the last century, most of the Balkans were incorporated into a united country called Yugoslavia. Today, there are seven independent countries in its place, but this is by no means where it might end.Serbia was the first to face the problem of Albanian separatism, but there are Albanian communities in other nations throughout the region – including Montenegro, Greece, and Northern Macedonia. In the latter, the threat is especially acute, since Albanians, who account for 25% of the country’s total population, live in the country’s western regions adjacent to Kosovo.

In the northern part of the province, there is an enclave populated mainly by Serbs, who do not like the prospect of being isolated from their larger homeland. Likewise, problems with separatism have inevitably arisen in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Republika Srpska, which is part of it, looks towards independence or reunification with Serbia and has increasingly expressed views on the future that contradict those of the central government.Read moreWestern diplomacy is immature and incapable of dialogue – Russian ambassador to IndiaThe same problem, though less acute, can be found in Croatian enclaves of Bosnia, as well as Croatia itself, where there are enclaves of Serbs.Iberian Peninsula: Two Countries Aren’t EnoughIf there wasn’t a king sitting in Madrid who still unites most of the peninsula, ‘Balkanization’ might well have been called ‘Iberization’ – there are more separatist movements in Spain than any other Western European country.The whole world is well aware of the problem of Catalonia. Just five years ago, in October 2017, the local authorities there held a referendum on independence, which ended in failure, despite the fact that more than 90% of those who voted supported the separation of the region from Spain. Madrid refused to recognize this expression of the people’s will. In the aftermath, some of the leaders of the Catalan separatist movement were arrested, while others managed to flee the country. However, this has hardly quashed the desire of local residents.In addition to the Catalan issue, there is also Basque separatism, which, unlike the Catalonian variety, often takes on more radical forms. Radical nationalists from ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna – Basque Country and Freedom) fought for independence from Spain and the Spanish crown for more than 40 years, killing 800 people. In 2018, the group announced its self-dissolution, but this doesn’t mean that the problem has gone away. One of the largest parties in the region, the Basque Nationalist Party, still supports the idea of independence from Madrid.                   FILE PHOTO. Demonstrators hold Basque and Catalonian flags in the northen Spanish Basque city of Donostia (San Sebastian) during a demonstration in support of Catalonia and its planned referendum on independence from Madrid to be held on October 1.     © GARI GARAIALDE  AFP                                                        Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities, or regions. While not reaching the level of separatism, the idea of regional autonomy flourishes in each of them to one degree or another. In localelections, candidates who call for more independence and autonomy regularly garner a large percentage of the vote in Aragon, Andalusia, Castile, Asturias, Cantabria, and Galicia, as well as other autonomous communities.And not all is sweetness and light in the Iberian peninsula’s other country, Portugal, either… though it’s true that the regions seeking to free themselves from the power of Lisbon are separated from that metropolis by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean: we’re talking the archipelago of Madeira and the Azores.Read moreHollywood abandoned Russia one year ago, but the country's box office has just set an all time record: How did this happen?Britain: A disunited KingdomScottish separatism has been haunting London for the past few years. After independence supporters won the last regional elections, they announced their intention to hold a second referendum on seceding from the United Kingdom. The first was held in 2014, when 55% opposed the divorce, and 45% supported it. Confident in the results of the vote, London didn’t interfere with the will of the Scots at that time.However, two years later, the UK voted to leave the European Union, and Edinburghdemanded a new referendum, as Scotsclearly wanted to stay in the EU, having voted against by a landslide 62%. The Scottish authorities had wanted to hold a new referendum in October 2023, but, last November, Great Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that plebiscites on independence cannot be held without London’s consent. This time the Tory-controlled parliament does not intend to grant it. Edinburgh has no intention of giving up, with the former head of the Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon promising “Scottishdemocracy will not be denied.”Last week,Sturgeon announced her resignation as Scotland’s first minister, but still, speaking of her successor, she expressed confidence that the person “will lead Scotland to independence.”                   FILE PHOTO.

In local elections in the spring of 2022, the Sinn Fein party, which advocates for reuniting with the Republic of Ireland and seceding from the Uk, won regional elections for the first time. The Northern Ireland Protocol, signed between London and the EU during Brexit, probably contributed to the separatists’ growing popularity. The document calls for preserving a single customs space between Dublin and Belfast, while actually introducing customs between Britain and Northern Ireland.London'sissues don’t stop there with varying degrees of separatist activity in Cornwall, Mercia (the West Midlands and East Midlands regions), Northumberland, Yorkshire, Jersey, and Wales, and even talk of England itself exiting the UK. However, these appear to be trite compared to the Scottish and Irish questions.Read moreLasers, spaceflight, surgery, nuclear power and the secrets of Mayan civilization: How Russian scientists changed the worldWestern Europe: Countries Within CountriesFor the most part, the countries of Western Europe seem to be exemplary unitary states, and generally that is what they are. However, there are also strong regional identities, as well as desires for more autonomy and separatist leanings.In France, for example, there is the problem of the Occitans, who occupy a huge area in the south of the country – as many as seven regions. Even an aggressive Francization policy wasn’t sufficient to solve this problem definitively: all signs in the region are regularly duplicated in Occitanian.Brittany, in the northwest of the country, also has a strong regional identity. Its inhabitants have their own Celtic language and prefer to call themselves Bretons, rather than French. In the last half of the 20th century, the Breton Liberation Front, which is the armed wing of the Breton Revolutionary Army, carried out terrorist attacks, while barking out slogans advocating independence for their homeland. In Corsica, radical groups haven’t shied away from employing violent means to achieve independence, even in this century.Each of these separatist communities boasts a political wing – the Occitan Party, the Breton Party, and the Free Corsica Party – whose programs range from demanding greater autonomy to calling for full independence. The last instance of violence occurred in the summer of last year, when the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) claimed responsibility for 16 arson attacks and took credit for bombing summer residences owned by non-Corsicans, as well as construction companies and police cars.

Bavarians are significantly different from other Germans. Their dialect is actually considered to be a separate language, if not officially recognized as such. Although regional identity is extremely strong, Bavarians rarely speak about separatism, at least publicly. But even in the absence of conflict, Berlin keeps its eye on Munich.Read moreNo quiet on the Eastern front: How the US has worked to prevent Russia and Japan from putting a formal end to World War TwoOne of Germany’s main parties, the Christian Democratic Union, whose representatives have repeatedly been selected as Germany’s Chancellor,does not contest elections in Bavaria.Instead, itworks in an alliance with the purely Bavarian Christian Social Union party, which has absorbed most of the separatist and radical nationalist Bavarian parties over time.In Italy, the issue of independence is being discussed in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. And these discussions are rather unpleasant for Rome. For example, Venetian politicians have managed to have Venetic recognized as an official language in their region, along with Italian. In March of 2014, 89% of respondents in an online poll conducted in the region supported creating a sovereign Federal Republic of Veneto. However, it hasn’t advanced to a referendum yet. The desire to achieve greater independence in these areas mainly stems from economic factors, but in South Tyrol, the national question also plays a role. This rich German-speaking region, which became part of Italy only after the First World War, has been striving to reunify with Austria for more than a century.The most likely candidate for disintegration in Western Europe is undoubtedly Belgium. It consists of two regions inhabited by very different peoples: Dutch-speaking Flemings, who make up about 60% of the country’s population, and French-speaking Walloons, who account for 40%. The linguistic division is aggravated by serious economic inequality between the regions – the Flemings have every reason to believe that their southern neighbors in Wallonia, whose unemployment rate is twice as high and GDP per capita a third lower, are living at their expense. Thirty years ago, Flanders’ dissatisfaction with this situation contributed to transforming a unified Belgium into a federation. Now the Flemings are fighting to extend their autonomy further, while the Walloons attempt to repulse their efforts.                   FILE PHOTO.

These regions include Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and eastern Ukraine.Read moreThe Fight for Ugledar: Why controlling a small town in southwestern Donbass is so important for the Russian militaryBut separatist aspirations are not confined to Europe. They can also be found in Asia, Africa, and even Oceania. This is especially true in countries with a colonial past, where borders were often drawn under external pressure without regard to local factors and the traditional homelands of tribes and peoples.The strongest non-European powers today are not without this problem either. The world is well aware of the separatist threats facing China. The United States has recently been increasingly touting claims for independence from Taiwan, Tibet, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Hong Kong, and Macau. A little more than half a century ago, Beijing was also fighting separatism in Inner Mongolia, but demographic trends have rendered this problem less relevant.That said, even the US itself, which from the outside appears to be one of the most monolithic nations in the word, could easily be divided into 11 smaller nations. Stories about Americans pushing for the independence of individual states – California and Texas, for example – pop up in the media from time to time, while more exotic movements advocating the independence of entire regions, such as Cascadia or the Republic of New Africa, also exist.At any rate, a complete list of all the separatist movements around the world would occupy a separate room in a library.                       © independent.co.uk                                                        Is there a solution?Timofey Bordachev, program director at the Valdai Club, in Moscow, believes that “Globally, separatism is a reaction to disassociation, the construction of new fences, and the rise of nationalism.”“If there was real globalization, there would be no separatism. Borders would be transparent, and people wouldn’t care where they live.Separatism is a struggle against the nationalism of the titular nation.Why do residents of Donbass and Eastern Ukraine want to get out from under Kiev’s power? The reason is Ukrainian nationalism. Why did separatists wanting to break with Georgia appear in South Ossetia and Abkhazia? Because Tbilisi tried to impose Georgian nationalism on these regions. That’s it.

But yes, most often a whole complex of historical, cultural, religious, linguistic, educational, and economic reasons lies behind each example of separatism,” he pointed out.In some sense, globalization has contributed to the growth of separatism, according to the expert. One of its consequences has been the appearance of glocalization, with regional differences strengthening, rather than disappearing as expected. “Instead of merging and unifying, trends in the opposite direction are emerging and gaining strength: separatist leanings, increased attention on local differences, heightened interest in ancient traditions, and the revival of dialects,” he said.Under these conditions, there are only two ways to fight separatism: repression and concessions. Countries often employ both of these methods simultaneously by persecuting separatist-minded activists, while granting separatist regions more autonomy at the same time. However, according to Timofey Bordachev, there is a more universal prescription:“Is there a theoretical solution to the problem of separatism? Yes. It’s an empire. The only prescription for separatism is an empire: large multinational, multi-confessional countries, such as Russia, China, and, to some extent, the United States.”By Georgiy Berezovsky, Vladikavkaz-based journalistFeature                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571605-only-prescription-for-separatism-is-empire/,2023,2,17

He said he would be surprised if Britain had “sufficient munitions to sustain a high intensity conflict for more than about a week.”The country's defense ministry said that it was continuing to “place orders to replace ammunition given to Ukraine” adding that it had allocated an extra £560 million ($673 million) to boost its stockpiles. However, previously Barrons estimated that the British military needed “an immediate annual boost of £3 billion” to support its defense potential.The report echoes a statement by Secretary of Defence Ben Wallace, who admitted in late January that the British armed forces have been “hollowed out and underfunded.” His remarks followed a Sky News report alleging that a top US general had told the minister that British forces are “barely tier two” in terms of fighting capabilities.These complications, however, did not stop the UK from providing Ukraine with £2.3 billion ($2.76 billion) of military assistance in 2022 alone, second only to the US' contribution.

Antony Blinken had urged both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to “pause” provocative steps in order to avoid further hostilities.The requests made by the Biden administration were originally geared towards the Palestinian Authority (PA) taking significant steps, whilst minimal requirements were put on the Netanyahu government. Antony Blinken urged Mahmoud Abbas to implement a “security plan” presented by US security coordinator Lt. Gen. Michael Fenzel, who proposed creating a special PA Security Force wing that would be trained by the US to fight Palestinian militias that have formed over the past two years in the Jenin and Nablus areas. Later on, the US also requested that Israel reduce the number of raids on Palestinian towns and refugee camps, in addition to halting their plans for significant settlement expansion; both of which Israel refuses to follow through on.Read moreUS issues request to Israel over West Bank – mediaRogue militiasIn September of 2021, the Jenin Brigades armed group announced its formation out of the Jenin refugee camp, later growing and expanding its areas of operations to the wider Jenin area. The armed group does not have any traceable command-and-control structure. It consists primarily of men between the ages of 18 and 25, mostly formed of members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement and Fatah Party members who are no longer loyal to the ruling clique in the party that commands the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority. Later, in September of 2022, the Lions’ Den armed movement also announced its formation in the old city of Nablus, claiming to belong to no political party. Due to the rise of newly formed armed groups, which hasn’t happened in the West Bank since the early 2000s, the Palestinian Authority’s security forces have lost control of much of the northern West Bank.The US proposal for the Palestinian Authority to form a special force to fight against the armed militias is an extremely dangerous intervention in the affairs of the region. It is reminiscent of the UK-backed “peace bands” formed under the British Mandate in the late 1930s, when the British took the initiative to use Palestinians to fight each other. However, unlike then, there is no support for anti-militia activities from the Palestinian public today. In fact, the overwhelming majority support the Jenin Brigades, Lions’ Den and other armed groups, according to all available polling data. The PA has been significantly weakened over the past three years due to a financial crisis, corruption, the lack of any diplomatic breakthroughs, the postponement of national elections, and the killing and detention of Palestinians for the sake of Israeli security.Third Intifada coming?The Palestinian Authority has even been engaged in limited armed exchanges with the newly formed militias in the West Bank over the past year, triggering mass protests from angry West Bank residents. The number one issue that Palestinians in the West Bank have with the PA is its ‘security coordination’ with Israel, which essentially means that the PA’s security forces work with the Israeli military, intelligence and border police, in order to combat Palestinian threats against Israelis, but not the other way around. When Israel raided the Jenin refugee camp last month, killing 10 Palestinians, including three civilians, one of whom was an elderly woman, the PA announced the suspension of security coordination in response.The US assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs met last week with Israel’s National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, and President Abbas’ senior advisor, Hussein al-Sheikh, to propose that the Palestinian Authority return to security coordination with Israel, in exchange for Israel slowing down settlement expansion. The US also sought for the PA to pause its attempts to take Israel before the International Court of Justice and the UN for alleged war crimes – a move for which the PA has been punished with Israeli sanctions.Last Thursday, CIA director Bill Burns expressed his concern over the possibility of a ‘third intifada’ [Palestinian uprising] erupting inside the West Bank, stating that “a lot of what we’re seeing today has a very unhappy resemblance to some of those realities that we saw then [during the Second Intifada] too”. His concern is congruent with the reality on the ground, where last year was the deadliest for West Bank Palestinians since the end of the Second Intifada in 2005, according to the United Nations. Palestinian attacks against Israeli settlers and soldiers are also a daily occurrence now.Read moreDeadly attack near Jerusalem is ‘terrorism’ – NetanyahuTwo-state solution blockedDespite the US government clearly identifying the nature of the escalation, it shows complete ignorance of its own role in creating the current hostilities. The bulk of the US secretary of state’s visit to Palestine-Israel was tailored to forwarding Arab-Israeli normalization efforts and to expanding the ‘Negev Forum’, which Morocco, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt form with Israel, in order to advance their own ties. At the same time, Antony Blinken spoke of reaching a “two-state solution” between Palestinians and Israelis as being the only path to any lasting peace.Under the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 (also known as the Saudi Initiative), a “two-state solution” (meaning the recognition by Israel of a Palestinian state and the end of occupation of Palestinian territories) is a precondition for the normalization of ties between Israel and Arab states. By pushing for normalization without that precondition, Blinken effectively seeks to deprive the Palestinian Authority of its best bargaining chip and leaves it powerless to extract any concessions from the Israeli government, whose officials will not even consider sitting down for meetings with their Palestinian counterparts.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already stated that he is not willing to halt settlement expansion, as proposed by the US government, with Israel’s Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, openly announcing that there will be no freeze on settlement construction, which is considered illegal by the UN and most world powers. Israel has also announced its intention to increase raids and further military activities in the West Bank, in what it deems to be a preparation for likely hostilities during the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan.Hope for Palestinians is the only way to peaceDespite the PA having announced the end of its security coordination with Israel, it is clear that some coordination is still occurring and that the announcement was more of a public relations move for President Abbas, who is feeling the pressure from a disgruntled Palestinian population. This in itself is a key indicator that the PA is feeling the pressure from Palestinian society at large and a sign that any US-trained PA force to combat the militia groups could lead to a disaster, whereby the Ramallah-based authority could even be overthrown due to the outrage such a step would cause. When the CIA worked to create the “new PA security force” during the latter years of the Second Intifada, it only worked after the PA itself had participated in the fight against the Israeli military and still maintained some degree of popular support. In addition to this, the Israeli army had conducted ‘Operation Defensive Shield,’ which led to the assassinations or arrests of the most prominent militia leaders inside the West Bank.Read morePalestinians killed in West Bank raidThe only way the PA could possibly regain control of Jenin and Nablus is by proving to the Palestinian people that it is on their side, and not fighting for the US and Israel. It is also the reality that many of the leading fighters in the militia groups, especially in Jenin, are actually members of the PA’s security forces that have gone rogue. Armed militias also seem to be forming in areas like Bethlehem, al-Khalil and even Jericho, which proves that the re-emergence of the armed struggle in the West Bank is not only limited to the north of the territory.The only way to properly combat the escalation and to stop this from growing into a much larger confrontation, is to provide hope for the Palestinian people inside the West Bank, something that the US will not even consider. Instead of the US working as an objective mediator, it works solely for Israel’s immediate interests and accepts the political restraints of each Israeli government as an excuse for repeatedly violating its own red lines. The US considers every single Palestinian political party as a terrorist organization, other than the mainstream branch of the Fatah Party, meaning that they will not even talk to any Palestinian representatives other than those that adhere to their own demands. The obsessive pursuit of Saudi Arabia normalizing ties with Israel, seemingly for political gain on behalf of the Biden administration, also contributes to robbing Palestinians of any hope for peace.The situation inside the West Bank cannot be resolved using bombs and bullets. Even if every single member of all the armed groups were to be killed, the same problem would again emerge for Israel in the future. Despite this, Washington will never look critically at what is going on and realize that there are two sides to this conflict. At this time the US government is dealing with the escalation as if Israel has a termite problem and not that there are people who are rising up in an ongoing struggle for statehood.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.oped                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/571334-us-israel-palestine-peace/,2023,2,11

This comes shortly after the scandal over a Chinese “spy balloon” in US airspace.The UK defense ministry last year signed a £100 million ($118.6 million) contract to research “stratospheric uncrewed air systems,” according to The Times’ report published Monday. Britain is considering buying a fleet of spy balloons, it added.Project Aether is a research initiative that aims to “better understand the stratosphere and the high-altitude platforms that could operate there,” Ross Corbett, the project’s military requirements manager told Desider. The research is assigned to the British Defence Equipment and Support’s Future Capabilities Group, London’s “hub for strategic research and innovation.”“Successfully exploiting [the stratosphere] could mean huge potential benefits,” Corbett said. He also explained that there was still a lot of testing to be done before Britain could operate surveillance airships at 50,000 to 80,000 feet above Earth for long periods of time.The proposed “high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned air systems” could be used for “intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and rebroadcast activities” by the UK armed forces and their NATO allies, Corbett said.Project Aether is working with the American Sierra Nevada corporation, British company Voltitude and the European joint venture Airbus, one of the leaders of the global aerospace industry.

We believe that state-to-state cooperation needs to be consistent with the trend of peace and development,” rather than about creating “exclusionary” regional alliances, Mao continued, going on to note the upcoming nuclear technology transfer from the US to Australia under the separate AUKUS pact.“The US has also built small blocs reminiscent of the Cold War by bolstering extended deterrence and conducting nuclear submarine cooperation,” she said.Further steps for the trilateral AUKUS agreement, which also includes the UK, are set to be revealed later this month, with officials hoping for a “seamless transfer” of nuclear propulsion technology from Washington to Canberra. Beijing has previously slammed the deal for advancing “nuclear proliferation” around the world, given that Australia lacks its own domestic capability for the sensitive tech.

London, Paris and Berlin would not comment on the record.“We keep repeating that Russia mustn’t win, but what does that mean?

If Moscow sees that the West is prepared to support Kiev even more, maybe it will be persuaded it can’t achieve its military objectives, the official added.France and Germany support the initiative and see it as a way to “boost Ukrainian confidence” and give it an incentive to start negotiations with Russia, according to unnamed officials from both countries.Sunak’s plan does not include stationing NATO forces in Ukraine or offering Kiev “Article 5” commitments to intervene in case of an attack, the officials said.

With energy revenue higher than before the conflict began, the country’s economy is predicted to grow faster than the UK’s this year.The sanctions, which were meant to impose suffering on the Russian people, have backfired on Western nations, President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday.“They miscalculated, and Russia’s economy proved much more robust than the West expected,” he said in his annual address to the country’s lawmakers.:    US reveals more anti-Russia sanctions                    ",https://www.rt.com/news/572041-eu-approves-anti-russia-sanctions/,2023,2,24
