Putin accuses Ukraine of border 'terrorist act' in Russian village - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, EPABy Laurence PeterBBC NewsRussian President Vladimir Putin says a Ukrainian sabotage group entered a Russian border region on Thursday and opened fire on civilians in a ""terrorist act"".The governor of Bryansk region said ""saboteurs from Ukraine"" had fired at a civilian car in Lyubechane, a border village, killing two men and wounding a 10-year-old boy.Kyiv strongly denied the Russian claim.The alleged incident has not been independently verified.Mykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted that it was ""a classic deliberate provocation"". ""RF [Russia] wants to scare its people to justify the attack on another country,"" he said. Russia has previously reported some Ukrainian missile and drone strikes on Russian border areas, including Bryansk region. But there have been no confirmed reports of Ukrainian ground forces infiltrating Russia.Russia´s Federal Security Service (FSB) said FSB forces and regular troops on Thursday clashed with ""Ukrainian nationalists"" who had crossed into Russia and taken hostages. The FSB said the ""nationalists"" were then hit with a massive Russian artillery strike and pushed back into Ukraine. They left a large cache of explosives in the village, the FSB alleged.When Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 President Putin branded the Kyiv government ""nationalists"" and ""neo-Nazis"", arguing that Russia had to act against them.President Zelensky was democratically elected, has Jewish origins and has no far-right politicians in his government. Speaking on Russian state TV on Thursday President Putin said ""today they committed another terrorist act, another crime, penetrated the border area and opened fire on civilians"".""They saw that it was a civilian car, that civilians and children were sitting there, and opened fire. It is exactly such people who set themselves the task of depriving us of historical memory. They will achieve nothing, we will put the squeeze on them,"" he said.A video has appeared online claiming to show members of the Ukraine-based Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) outside a local clinic. One armed man in the video, posted on Telegram, says they crossed into Russia. The investigative journalism group Bellingcat Monitoring describes the RVC as ""a unit officially formed last year made up primarily of anti-Putin, anti-Kremlin Russian far-right figures active in Ukraine"".A Bellingcat expert, Michael Colborne, has identified one of the men in the video as RVC leader Denis Kapustin, who also uses the surname Nikitin. ""This RVC seems to do very little actual fighting, or at least serious fighting, and Kapustin may have physical combat sports training but he is not from any sort of military background,"" Mr Colborne told the BBC. In a text post with the video the RVC said it ""entered Bryansk region to show our compatriots that there is hope, that free Russians carrying arms can fight the regime"".Commenting on the RVC claim, a Ukrainian military intelligence official, Andriy Yusov, said ""these are people who are fighting with arms against the Putin regime and those who support him... Perhaps Russians are beginning to wake up, realise something and take some concrete steps"".This week Mr Putin accused Ukraine and Western spies of intensifying operations inside Russia. Russian officials said a drone crashed in the Kolomna district just 100km (62 miles) from Moscow - though it was not confirmed to be Ukrainian - while two Ukrainian drones were allegedly shot down in southern Russia. Previously Russia said drones had attacked an airbase in southern Russia used for launching bomber strikes on Ukraine. Kyiv has not claimed drone attacks inside Russia, accusing the Kremlin of propaganda.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64826028,02,03,2023,bbc,russia

Spy at UK's Berlin embassy jailed for selling secrets to Russia - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: How MI5 caught UK embassy spy selling secrets to RussiaBy Tom Symonds and  Judith BurnsBBC NewsA spy at Berlin´s British embassy, who sold secrets to Russia and was caught in an undercover MI5 sting, has been jailed for 13 years and two months. David Smith, 58, tried to damage Britain´s interests by passing on details of the embassy and its staff for cash payments, a judge found after the spy pleaded guilty.Sentencing him, Mr Justice Wall said Smith had ""put people at maximum risk"". UK police have described Smith´s actions as ""reckless and dangerous"".They have revealed how the spy was caught in a ""remarkable"" investigation involving two fake Russian agents working for the British security services. Major investigationSmith, formerly with the RAF, had been employed as a security guard at the embassy in Berlin for four years when, in 2020, he wrote to a Russian general passing on the names, addresses and phone numbers of colleagues, along with documents and information about security passes. He had been collecting classified documents since 2018, motivated by his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and hatred of the UK, the judge found. The letter ended up in the hands of the Metropolitan Police and MI5, triggering a major investigation which also involved German law enforcement. In August 2021, to gather additional evidence, Smith was told a man with the Russian name Dmitry was to visit the embassy, and he was asked to arrange for him to pass through security. ""Oh it´s one of those,"" Smith reportedly responded. He seemed to believe Dmitry was a Russian ""walk-in"", intent on passing secrets to Britain. In his sentencing remarks, the judge said Smith had done as much as he could to ""ensure that Dmitry´s identity could be revealed"". Had Dmitry´s story been genuine ""it is impossible to know what would have been the consequences to him"", the judge said. This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Mr Justice Wall delivers David Smith´s sentence at the Old BaileyDuring the visit, Smith was told to copy apparently secret documents Dmitry had brought with him. These had been marked with a pink highlighter to identify them. Dmitry also asked Smith to throw away some packaging from a mobile phone Sim card he had been given.It was all a ruse. Dimitry was an MI5-trained ""role player"" and ""Smith fell for it"", Cdr Richard Smith of the Metropolitan Police told the BBC. The documents with the pink markings, which were not remotely secret, were later found at Smith´s home, along with the Sim card packaging. Investigators had also placed a covert camera in the room where Smith worked, monitoring CCTV images. This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Hidden British embassy camera shows David Smith on phoneThis captured him looking through video of Dmitry´s visit, and taking pictures of the fake visitor. He could be heard muttering to himself that if Dmitry worked at the Russian embassy, staff there would know who he was.  ""It´s probably nothing but at least I´ve done it,"" he was recorded as saying.Next, MI5 arranged for ""Irina"", another Russian speaker, to approach Smith at a tram stop posing as an officer of the GRU, Russian military intelligence. Her story, also false, was that she had been sent from Moscow to ask him for help because someone was passing information to the British. Again, Smith fell for it, arranging a meeting with Irina the following day. Video seizedAfter his arrest, his flat in Potsdam was searched, and among the items found was a piece of paper with the email address of the Russian embassy. Video was seized of Smith walking around the British embassy, meticulously filming offices, safes, the insides of drawers and a whiteboard recording details of staff deployments. Smith had also photographed communications equipment. A letter to a Russian colonel offering to send a ""book from the defence section"" classified as ""official-sensitive"" was found on a storage device.Police also found images of a letter from two secretaries of state to then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Cdr Smith said: ""The activities he was conducting and the information he was seeking to gain did raise a significant risk to UK interests and individuals.""A consular official said that as a result of Smith´s actions, a security review had to be carried out for every member of embassy staff costing the taxpayer £825,000. Image source, Social MediaSmith admitted eight charges under the Official Secrets Act and was sentenced after a hearing to determine why he did it.The spy was a keen military historian, whose Ukrainian wife had left Germany for her home country, because she did not like living there. Smith appeared to share this view, colleagues at the embassy told police. He had also told fake Russian intelligence officer Irina that Germany was dominated by Nazis.Conspiracy theoriesIn his evidence, Smith said he became depressed and was drinking heavily after his wife returned to Ukraine. He was also angry at his employer, complaining he had to go to work every day during the pandemic when ""everyone was sitting at home with full pay"".He admitted being interested in conspiracy theories, including those of David Icke and Alex Jones´s Infowars, but denied being pro-Russian or having far right sympathies. However, the prosecution highlighted his collection of Russian military memorabilia, as well as his past support for Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Inside his work locker was a cartoon of Mr Putin with his hands around the neck of former German chancellor Angela Merkel in Nazi uniform.  Cdr Smith said the spy was ""motivated by anti-UK, pro-Russian views, he understood that the info he was collecting was damaging to British interests, and yet he shared it with the Russians anyway"".An MI5 officer gave evidence that Smith´s spying coincided with the build-up of Russian forces before the war in Ukraine and the concerns about the treatment of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. The resulting risks could not ""be sensibly described as theoretical"", the MI5 staffer told the court, using the code name 2093. Smith was arrested with 800 euros (£713) in cash, and police analysed his bank accounts which showed he was not withdrawing his salary, suggesting had another source of income. The amount of money he was paid may never be known. Senior police officers would not say how much information Russia could have received from the spy.

Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warBy The Visual Journalism Team  BBC NewsRussia has targeted cities across Ukraine in a new wave of missile strikes.Here are the latest developments:Cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa have been hit by Russian missilesPower at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was lost for several hoursHeavy fighting continues around Bakhmut in the east of the countryFront lines in the south around Kherson are largely stableMissile strikes across UkraineOn Thursday, Russian missiles struck targets in cities across Ukraine, killing at least nine people.Buildings and infrastructure were hit in Kyiv, Odesa and Kharkiv, with power blackouts in several areas.Ukraine said Russia had fired 81 missiles, the largest number in a single wave for several weeks.Five people were killed in Lviv, while other targets included Dnipro, Kherson and Zhytomyr.Russia said Kinzhal hypersonic missiles were launched in the attacks.A strike at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station cut the plant off from the Ukrainian power system for several hours, according to the nuclear energy operator Euratom.For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators, which have enough supplies to last at least 10 days.The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has issued an urgent warning about safety at the plant. ""How can this be allowed to happen... One day our luck will run out,"" said Rafael Grossi. Fighting rages around Bakhmut in the eastUkrainian forces are holding on in the eastern city of Bakhmut, under intense pressure from regular Russian troops and Wagner group mercenaries fighting on the Russian side.On Wednesday, the Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said that his forces had captured all of eastern Bakhmut.The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that the claim was ""consistent with available visual evidence"".Why Bakmut matters for Russia and UkraineHas Putin´s war failed?Many military analysts say the city is of limited strategic significance. ""Russian forces remain unlikely to rapidly exploit a breakthrough beyond Bakhmut if Russian forces capture the city,"" says the ISW. The UK Ministry of Defence noted in December that capturing the city ""would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk"".Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.The fighting is part of a Russian spring offensive, which many analysts say is now under way.Michael Kofman, of the US-based Center for Naval Analysis, says that, so far, Russia´s gains have been ""underwhelming"".But, he adds, Ukraine may struggle to find weaknesses in Russia´s defences to mount a counter-attack, as Russian troop positions have been heavily reinforced. Front lines in the south stableIn the south of the country, artillery strikes continue around Kherson.Russian troops withdrew to the left bank, or eastern side, of the Dnipro River in November. Strikes by Ukrainian forces equipped with US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launchers had made Russian positions unsustainable.On Wednesday, Ukraine said its forces had destroyed a Russian ammunition depot to the west of Kherson.But many analysts assess that the front lines around the city are unlikely to change in the short term as Russia has built strong defences for its troops and equipment in the area.More than a year of fightingRussia´s invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022. Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine. They had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv, and controlled much of the north-east of the country around Sumy. Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol. But, they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.More Western arms followed and by October the picture had changed dramatically - having failed to take Kyiv, Russia had withdrawn completely from the north. Ukraine had its first major success, pushing Russia back from Kharkiv, and counter-attacking around Kherson.One year since the invasion, Ukraine is in control of Kherson and largely containing, for now, the Russian advance in the east.By David Brown, Bella Hurrell, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Lucy Rodgers, Paul Sargeant, Alison Trowsdale, Tural Ahmedzade, Mark Bryson, Zoe Bartholomew, Sean Willmott, Sana Dionysiou, Joy Roxas, Gerry Fletcher, Jana Tauschinsk, Debie Loizou, Simon Martin and Prina Shah.About these mapsTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute´s Critical Threats Project. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research.The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished4 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished1 hour agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished54 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Ukraine war: Blinken says China might give weapons to Russia - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesBy Samuel Horti in London and James Landale in MunichBBC NewsThe US says China is considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia for the Ukraine war - a claim strongly denied by Beijing.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Chinese firms were already providing ""non-lethal support"" to Russia and new information suggested Beijing could provide ""lethal support"".Such an escalation would mean ""serious consequences"" for China, he warned.Beijing said the claims were false and accused Washington of spreading lies.""We do not accept the United States´ finger-pointing on China-Russia relations, let alone coercion and pressure,"" China´s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference on Monday, when asked about the allegations.China has also denied reports that Moscow has requested military equipment.Chinese President Xi Jinping is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and is yet to condemn Russia´s invasion of Ukraine - but he has sought to remain neutral in the conflict and has called for peace.Mr Blinken was speaking to CBS News after he met China´s top diplomat, Wang Yi, on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.He said that during the meeting he expressed ""deep concerns""  about the ""possibility that China will provide lethal material support to Russia"".""To date, we have seen Chinese companies... provide non-lethal support to Russia for use in Ukraine. The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they´re considering providing lethal support,"" he said. He did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China´s potential plans. When pressed on what the US believed China might give to Russia, he said it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition.The US has sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly providing satellite imagery of Ukraine to the mercenary Wagner Group, which supplies Russia with thousands of fighters. Mr Blinken told CBS that ""of course, in China, there´s really no distinction between private companies and the state"".What support is China offering Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?If China provided Russia with weapons, that would cause a ""serious problem for us and in our relationship"", he added.Relations between Washington and Beijing were already poor after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in early February. Both sides exchanged angry words, but equally both sides appeared embarrassed by the incident and seemed ready to move on.But if China were to deliver weapons to help Russian forces in Ukraine, then US-Chinese relations would deteriorate much more severely.It would be the most ""catastrophic"" thing that could happen to the relationship between the two giants, said top Republican senator Lindsay Graham.""It would be like buying a ticket on the Titanic after you saw the movie,"" he told ABC News. ""Don´t do this.""Mr Blinken´s warning seems to be clearly designed to deter China from doing that.Mr Blinken also said the US was worried about China helping Russia evade Western sanctions designed to cripple Russia´s economy. China´s trade with Russia has been growing, and it is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas, and coal.Nato members, including the US, are sending a variety of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, including tanks. They have stopped short of sending fighter jets, and Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether the US would help other countries supply jets.""We´ve been very clear that we shouldn´t fixate or focus on any particular weapons system,"" he said. He did, however, say that the West must ensure Ukraine had what it needed for a potential counter offensive against Russia ""in the months ahead"". Russia is currently trying to advance in eastern regions of Ukraine, where some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place.The top US diplomat´s remarks come ahead of a scheduled visit by Mr Wang to Moscow, as part of the Chinese foreign policy chief´s tour of Europe.Mr Wang said in Munich on Saturday that China had ""neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire"" for the Ukraine war, Reuters reported.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chinese foreign affairs Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech in Munich on SaturdayChina would publish a document that laid out its position on settling the conflict, Mr Wang said. The document would state that the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, he said.""I suggest that everybody starts to think calmly, especially friends in Europe, about what kind of efforts we can make to stop this war,"" Mr Wang said.He added that there were ""some forces that seemingly don´t want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon"", but did not say who he meant. The Chinese President, Mr Xi, is scheduled to deliver a ""peace speech"" on the anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, 24 February, according to Italy´s foreign minister Antonio Tajani.Mr Tajani told Italian radio that Mr Xi´s speech would call for peace without condemning Russia, Reuters reported.During their meeting, Mr Blinken and Mr Wang also exchanged strong words on the deepening row over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the US. Mr Blinken said during the meeting that the US would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Blinken told CBS that other nations were concerned about what he called China´s ""surveillance balloon program"" across five continents.Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"". China has denied sending a spy balloon.And on Sunday morning, Beijing warned that the US would ""bear all the consequences"" if it escalated the argument over the balloon. China would ""follow through to the end"" in the event ""the US insists on taking advantage of the issue"", it said in a foreign ministry statement reported by Reuters.The full interview with CBS - the BBC´s US broadcasting partner - is due to air on Sunday.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64695042,20,02,2023,bbc,russia
Russian spy network accused of sabotage arrested in Poland - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The group reportedly installed cameras at places including Rzeszow-Jasionka airport, where Joe Biden flew intoBy Adam EastonBBC News, WarsawA group of foreign citizens have been arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia, two Polish government officials have told the BBC. Radio station RMF FM reported that Polish security services had broken up a spy network working for Russia.Six people were detained on suspicion of having installed secret cameras to film transport infrastructure used to deliver aid to Ukraine, it reported.RMF FM said the cell had prepared sabotage plans.The decades-long spy conflict between Russia and the West has intensified since the Ukraine war. Poland is one of Ukraine´s strongest allies and its security forces have arrested several people on suspicion of spying for Russia since the invasion last February.Ukraine: The spy war within the warAccording to the radio station, the group had installed dozens of cameras beside railway junctions and important transport routes in Poland´s Podkarpackie province, which borders Ukraine, it said.Some of them were found close to a small regional airport that has been converted into an international logistics hub delivering military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Military and cargo aircraft from the US and across Europe regularly fly in and out of the Rzeszow-Jasionka airport, where American troops can be seen beside their Humvees, to deliver supplies to waiting trucks that make the 100km (62 mile) journey to the Ukrainian border. The site is considered so sensitive, Washington has deployed US Patriot air defence systems to protect the airfield. US President Joe Biden flew into the airport on his way to his recent visit to Kyiv.Security at critical infrastructure sites has reportedly been heightened, RMF FM said. Poland´s Interior Minister, Mariusz Kaminski, who is responsible for the Polish Internal Security Agency (ABW) - and whose officers reportedly made the arrests - is due to speak to the media about the RMF FM report on Thursday morning.Several people have been arrested for spying in the past year. Last month, prosecutors charged a Russian citizen, who is a long-term resident in Poland, with spying for Russia between 2015 and 2022. The man, who ran a business in Poland, was allegedly involved with historical reconstruction groups, where he made contacts with Polish military personnel. He was arrested in April last year following an investigation that found he allegedly collected information on the organisational structure of Polish military units in the north-east of the country.A Spanish national of Russian origin, who was identified as an agent for Russia´s military intelligence agency (GRU) was arrested in Przemysl, south-eastern Poland, by the ABW last year on suspicion of spying for Moscow. In March last year, a Polish employee of the Warsaw Registry Office, identified as Tomasz L., was arrested on suspicion of transferring operationally valuable data to the Russian intelligence services.Additional reporting by Bartosz KielakRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSpyingRussiaPoland",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64971691,15,03,2023,bbc,russia
How Russia's 35-mile armoured convoy ended in failure - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, BBC / Claire Jude PressBy Claire Press and Svitlana LibetBBC World Service and BBC Ukrainian Service, KyivThree days into Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, a huge 10-mile (15.5km) line of armoured vehicles was spotted by a satellite in the north of the country. The very same morning in Bucha, just outside Kyiv, 67-year-old Volodymyr Scherbynyn was standing outside his local supermarket when more than a hundred Russian military vehicles rolled into town. Both Volodymyr and the satellite were witnesses to a key part of President Vladimir Putin´s plan for a quick and overwhelming victory. They were also witnesses to its failure.The western media called it a convoy. In reality, it was a traffic jam and a major tactical blunder. Forty-eight hours after that first satellite photograph, on 28 February 2022, the line of vehicles had grown to a colossal 35 miles (56 km) long. The vehicles were stalled for weeks. Then finally they retreated, and seemingly disappeared overnight.  What happened? Why did such a massive force fail to reach Kyiv?A BBC team spoke to dozens of witnesses; including military personnel, national and international intelligence services, civilians, veterans, and the territorial defence, all of whom came into contact with the convoy. It also gained access to Russian maps and documents that shed light on what the plan actually was, and why it went so spectacularly wrong.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Satellite images of the convoy captured last year © 2022 Maxar TechnologiesThe first hoursThe story starts on the first day of the war, in the north of Ukraine at its border with Belarus.Stepping outside for his first cigarette of the day, 23-year-old Vladyslav from Ukraine´s 80th Air Assault Brigade saw a flurry of bright lights in the night sky. ""I remember watching the lights emerge from the whole forest. At first I thought they were car headlights. But then I realised they were Grads [self-propelled multiple missile launchers]. They were firing at us."" Camped deep within the forest of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Vladyslav´s unit was on patrol when the first Russian vehicles crossed into Ukraine.""The whole earth was shaking. Have you ever been in a tank? There´s no other sound like it. It´s a powerful thing.""As planned in the event of any attack, Vladyslav and the rest of the 80th brigade blew up the bridge connecting Chernobyl to the next big town, Ivankiv.The Russians would be forced to waste time building a replacement pontoon bridge, giving Vladyslav and his unit time to pull back to Kyiv. ""At first I was surprised, why didn´t we stop them there in Chernobyl? But we needed to learn about our enemy. So that´s what we did."" This close to the Belarus border, the Ukrainians could not afford to open fire and risk starting another conflict. Their priority was to first understand Russia´s battle plan, before sending their troops into the line of fire. Putin´s master planWhat Vladyslav saw were the first vehicles of what would become the convoy.Contrary to many media reports at the time, the 35 mile-long (56 km) column was in fact 10 separate Russian tactical battalion units, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.The Russian army also attacked Ukraine in the east and south, but the mission for these 10 units was specific - enter Ukraine from Belarus, overthrow Ukraine´s capital city and remove the government. In military terms: a decapitation attack.One Russian document, seen by the BBC, shows a timetable for the plan. After the first battalion crossed into Ukraine at 04:00 am on 24 February, their orders were to advance straight to Kyiv arriving by 14:55. Several of the battalions were to advance to Hostomel, just north of Kyiv, to back up the troops who´d been airlifted in to secure the airport.The rest were to head straight into the centre of Kyiv. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Luibov Demydiv (R), a pensioner from Demydiv, points on the map to where she saw the convoy circling after a bridge was destroyed, stopping their advanceThe assault heavily relied on two elements - secrecy and speed.According to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) (a UK-based security think tank) by keeping plans about an attack on the capital under wraps, Russian soldiers could outnumber the Ukrainian forces by 12 to one in the north of Kyiv.However, Putin´s secrecy came at a cost. So successful was his deception, even most of his commanders did not receive their orders until 24 hours before the invasion. On a tactical level, this left them vulnerable. They lacked food, fuel and maps. They were without proper communication tools. They had insufficient ammunition. They were even ill-prepared for the winter weather.Kitted out with the wrong tyres and surrounded by snow, the Russians drove straight into a mud bath. Civilians close to Ivankiv describe Russian soldiers telling Ukrainian farmers to help pull their tanks out of the sludge. How war is seen in rural RussiaHas Putin´s war in Ukraine failed?Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checkedUnable to progress, the Russian vehicles needed to divert to paved roads in order to avoid soft ground, forcing thousands to group into a single column. But with limited communication between the battalions, they almost immediately converged into one almighty traffic jam.  As one military expert on the ground put it: ""You don´t ever travel into hostile territory in a long convoy. Ever.""Based on witness testimony and intelligence from the Ukrainian military, we were able to map the ground the convoy covered in the time between the outbreak of war and the end of March. By avoiding travelling across fields, vehicles ended up on most of the main roads north of Kyiv.By the time the column had grown as long as 35 miles (56 km) it included up to 1,000 tanks, 2,400 mechanised infantry vehicles and 10,000 personnel, as well as dozens of supply trucks carrying food, fuel, oil and ammunition.  Stalled north of Kyiv and running out of food and fuel, the Russians had also underestimated their adversary. A united resistanceFor three days Volodymyr Scherbynyn and his fellow volunteers, the majority of them pensioners, had been preparing for the arrival of the convoy in their hometown of Bucha.Armed with one machine gun between the 12 of them, they took down all the road signs, built checkpoints, and prepared hundreds of petrol bombs.Until finally, on Sunday morning the Russian tanks rolled into town. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Maksym (L) Volodymyr (C) and ´""the colonel"" (R) stand in front of their bombed out office for local volunteersFor nearly 30 minutes, Volodymyr and his grassroots unit battered the tanks with what little they had.""We set two of the vehicles on fire and slowed down the whole convoy,"" says Volodymyr.But then came the retaliation. ""When they saw us throwing bottles they opened fire,"" says 30-year-old Maksym Shkoropar. ""I was a barman. I didn´t have any military training.""By the end of that half hour, every one of Volodymyr´s party had been shot and evacuated to hospital.But even from the sick bay, Volodymyr kept on fighting - receiving and cross-checking sightings of the convoy from civilians all over the Kyiv region and calling them in to the Ukrainian authorities.On the other end of the line was 23-year-old local city councillor for Irpin, Roman Pohorily. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Lawyer and councillor by day, Roman searches for Russian posts on social media by night.He tells the BBC he didn´t sleep for three days.""My colleague and I were manning the hotline at the council office, taking calls about the column, as well as saboteurs - people who were painting marks on the ground for the convoy to follow.""A councillor by day, Roman is also an open source intelligence expert by night. Co-founder of the highly regarded website DeepState, he pools together social media and intelligence reports. He geolocates them, then reposts them on his website.  ""On their way to Kyiv, the Russians were posting videos on social media. We reposted the videos to expose their movements. They were just showing off, but in doing so, they got busted."" Most important during the assault on Kyiv, says Roman, was the sense of a united Ukraine. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Ukrainian volunteers distributing food""Everyone was doing something. I admit it was very hectic in those first few days. But there were veterans helping civilians. Everyone wanted to defend their city.""In towns and villages all across the region, hundreds of attacks took place against the convoy, from civilians armed with homemade weapons to mechanised infantry and artillery.Outdated tacticsIn stark contrast to the Ukrainians, the Russian forces repeatedly exposed their inability to make dynamic decisions on the ground. ""The Russians were all carrying large metal boxes marked ´secret´,"" says Vladyslav from the 80th Brigade. ""We seized one during an ambush. We found their maps marked with their entire route. After that we knew their whole strategy.""Their navigation tools were also woefully out of date. In the year since the invasion, the BBC has continued to find maps left behind by Russian troops that date back to the 1960s and 70s. Whole towns exist now that were not on the maps that they were using to navigate. We also found semaphore flags, a vastly outdated way to communicate between units.One successful tactic by the Ukrainian resistance was to blow up bridges and dams ahead of the convoy, thus forcing the Russians to reroute. Reliant on old maps and with limited communications back to their high command, the Russian units frequently became paralysed by indecision.Several satellite images show the Russian vehicles literally driving round and around in circles. Image source, Maxar Technologies 2022OccupationUnder pressure from Ukrainian air strikes and artillery, the Russian convoy was finally brought to a standstill just outside of Kyiv´s city boundary. For thousands of civilians living close to the stalled troops, the experience was horrendous. ""They robbed everything from everywhere. They emptied the shops,"" says Vladyslav. ""They also used civilians as human shields.""What happened in many villages and towns to the north and west of Kyiv is still being investigated by numerous authorities, including the International Criminal Court. After four long weeks the Russians finally started to withdraw.Two of the largest remaining battalions were defeated close to Hostomel airport. Another 370 tented army trucks, seemingly abandoned in Zdvizhivka village, were destroyed by artillery. The Ukrainian military kept on pushing them back until 19 March, after which the Russians began to retreat from Kyiv Oblast.Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, A graveyard of Russian vehicles from the convoy piled high in HostomelRussia is continuing to push into the eastern industrial heartland of Donbas, and strike in the south, in the direction of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.Despite the speculation of a renewed attack on Kyiv, the majority of experts agree it would be unlikely as we have not seen a large-scale deployment of Russian troops to the Belarus border.But still watching via reconnaissance drones close to the border, are the Ukrainian recruits. ""I´ll always remember that night in Chernobyl,"" says Vladyslav. ""When I went out to smoke with my friend. But by the time I´d finished my cigarette the war had started.""My friend and I have this dream, that we will go on shift, just like we did that day, and as we smoke another cigarette we will hear that the war has ended. And that we won.""Special thanks to Slava Shramovych, Marcus Buckley, Michael Whelan, Alastair Thompson, Ben Allen and Tim Coey.

Ukraine war: The Moldovan enclave surrounded by pro-Russian forces - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage caption, The ferry that transports people across from Molovata Noua to the rest of Moldova - the only link the enclave has with the rest of the countryBy Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Molovata NouaA short drive from Ukraine´s southern border, hundreds of Russian troops guard a vast Soviet-era ammunition depot in Moldova´s breakaway region of Transnistria.This depot, these soldiers and this pro-Russian separatist region are under increasing global scrutiny.In the past few weeks, accusations have flown between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova over alleged plots to destabilise Moldova, and warnings about the potential for conflict to erupt here again.Moldova´s prime minister, Dorin Recean, has said Russian troops should be expelled from the region, amid warnings from President Maia Sandu that Moscow is planning to topple her pro-western government.Russia, meanwhile, has been talking up the threat of a ""false flag"" attack by Ukrainian forces - and warned that any attack on its troops in Transnistria would be seen as an attack on Russia itself.Many western analysts point out that Transnistria could provide Russia with another entry point into Ukraine, forcing Ukrainian troops away from other areas of fighting.So Transnistria - controlled by pro-Russian separatists since Moldova´s civil war in 1992 - is being closely watched globally, but also by those much closer to home.The warnings and threats about fresh conflict here hang heavy over the village of Molovata Noua.This is a tiny Moldovan enclave, jammed up against Transnistrian territory and separated from the rest of Moldova by the River Dneister.If residents of Chisinau feel vulnerable, residents of Molovata Noua feel completely exposed.Many of the older men here fought pro-Russian separatists for this land 30 years ago. They´re wondering now if they´ll have to fight here again.On Friday, veterans of that conflict gathered in Molovata Noua for an annual pilgrimage across the line of control into Transnistria, to honour those who died.Two dozen men in military fatigues, bright medals on their chests and darkness behind their eyes. Among them, 62-year-old Vlad Untila.Image caption, Vlad Untila says he´s ready should Molovata Noua need to defend itself against Russia""We´re lucky that Ukraine is defending us at the moment,"" he said, ""but if it kicks off in Moldova, we´re ready to defend this territory again.""Their convoy of cars makes its way down the deserted dirt road from Molovata Noua into the breakaway pro-Russian territory - crossing into enemy territory as they did three decades ago.""See how they look at us,"" Vlad growls, as his car approaches the Russian checkpoint.  A gaggle of armed soldiers eye the convoy, as it carries men in Moldovan military fatigues into separatist territory, turning a blind eye to this eye-catching annual ritual.""Look around you,"" Vlad says, ""this is where we fought - it was all a battlefield.""Now the narrow dirt road cuts through the silent countryside, flanked by brown fields and broken winter trees.""It´s hard because I feel I´m in my own country,"" his friend Constantin joins in. ""It´s my own land, and yet I can´t walk freely here.""A short drive beyond the checkpoint, hidden in brambles by the side of the road, is the first stop on the pilgrimage - a simple blue cross made from metal poles.It marks the spot, 31 years ago, where a local mayor was killed.  The veterans gather round with a garland of flowers and a plastic bottle full of wine, to toast their fallen comrades.They follow the trail of pale blue monuments dotted through this territory, repeating the ritual at every stop, honouring their comrades, siblings, and friends.""We were both snipers,"" Vlad remembers, at the spot his friend Vasea was killed. ""They were shooting at us from that hill over there, from a tank. One of the shrapnel fragments hit him in the neck. He fell to the ground and died in my arms.""As the veterans pass a local Moldovan school, pupils come out to greet them, led by their headmistress Tatiana Rosca.""There were big battles here in 1992,"" Tatiana says.  ""And there are still deep wounds in the souls of the people.  We´re very afraid: we know what war means and we don´t wish it on anyone.""One of her pupils says she´s ready to take up arms if conflict erupts again, as her father and grandfather did 30 years ago.But loyalties here - as in the rest of Moldova - are complicated by history, geography and economics.  Here on the other side of the River Dniester, the pull of Moldovan identity is set against the pull of subsidised Russian gas from Transnistria.The economic gulf with the rest of the country has widened since the start of the war in Ukraine, after Moscow cut gas supplies to Moldova last year.""I´ll be honest,"" the mayor of Molovata Noua, Oleg Gazea, told me. ""It´s very difficult to convince people that life is better in Moldova when they pay a fraction of the price for gas here.""""We can´t talk about freedom and a better life, and at the same time tell them to go across the river and pay 30 times more for their bills - they´ll tell us: are you crazy? But there´s a hidden price [to the cheap gas] - it buys their support.""Some people here firmly believe that Moscow is not a military threat, but an economic ally - and that president Maia Sandu is the one provoking a war by moving closer to the West.""Transnistria is really sticking up for us,"" 59 year old Maria Ursachi tells me.  ""But Moldova is a disappointment. People are afraid to come over the river to talk to us: they have a border control post there and they check our bags. Chisinau doesn´t see us.""Arriving back in Molovata Noua, the veterans end their pilgrimage in the village square by laying red carnations at a memorial to the frozen conflict here.In the years since they fought the pro-Russian separatists, their children have grown up alongside Russian soldiers, Russian language and Russian economic support.""We older men will still form the heart of any resistance"", Vlad tells me, ""even with the involvement of younger men.""Memories of the past, that linger in this tiny Moldovan enclave, are being sharpened by growing fears for the future.

Lavrov visit to South Africa: Pandor defends joint Russia-China military exercise - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Both parties described the other as a friend, with Naledi Pandor describing their talks as ""wonderful""By Cecilia Macaulay & Pumza FihlaniBBC News, London & PretoriaSouth Africa has defended its decision to hold a joint military exercise with Russia and China next month.Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor condemned the ""double-standard"" which says some countries can perform such exercises but others are not.""All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,"" Dr Pandor added.The comments came at a press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Pretoria.The event attracted a small group of protesters outside the venue, waiving Ukrainian flags.Dr Pandor went on to slam the suggestion that South Africa cannot conduct the military exercises it wants to as an ""abuse of international practice"".""This is just a natural set of exercises that occur between countries,"" she said.Africa Live: More on this and other stories from the continentHow Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaRussia and the West fight for Africa´s heartLast week South Africa´s military announced it would hold joint naval drills with Russia and China off its coast next month.But there has been some criticism that the exercise is not appropriate, given that it coincides with the first anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.Not much information has been given about the exercises, but the state-owned Tass news agency reports that a Russian warship armed with hypersonic cruise weapons will take part.The Ministry of Defence has also defended the planned drills, saying that South Africa has in the past hosted similar exercises with France, the US and countries from the Western Nato military alliance.The drills will run for 10 days from 17 February to 27 February in the port city of Durban, and Richards Bay.The aim is to share operational skills and knowledge, the South African National Defence Force said.Despite pressure from Western countries to condemn the Russian invasion, South Africa has remained neutral - to the disappointment of Ukraine. Speaking at the conference, Mr Lavrov said he appreciated the ""well balanced"" and ""considerate"" approach of South Africa to the Ukraine war, which South Africa´s Dr Pandor said must be resolved diplomatically and through negotiation.Officials in South Africa have repeatedly said they do not condone the invasion but will not be forced into choosing sides and are continuing to engage with both countries in a business-as-usual manner.Critics of South Africa´s stance have accused the country of playing coy.South Africa´s leaders have a connection to Russian dating back to the fight against white-minority rule, or apartheid, when some members of the country´s liberation movement received military training in Russia.In recent years that relationship has grown into business ties through the Brics bloc of emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Mr Lavrov was also in Africa in July 2022, when he visited Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville, and South Africa is not alone in refusing to take sides in the war in Ukraine.Many African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West and East Africa respectively - voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March last year, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine.However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa, including South Africa.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSergei LavrovRussiaSouth Africa",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64373448,23,01,2023,bbc,russia

Russia Ukraine invasion: Indians are braving war to study in Ukraine - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lviv in western Ukraine is far from the fighting - but there are frequent sirens warning of attacksBy Jugal Purohit BBC Hindi, DelhiRishi Dwivedi is one of thousands of Indian students evacuated from Ukraine a year ago - but he´s now back studying in Lviv, despite the threat the war poses to his safety.""Air raid sirens alerting us about incoming missile or drone attacks go off as many as four times a day,"" Mr Dwivedi, 25, told the BBC.The fifth-year student, from Kannauj in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, is pursuing a bachelor´s degree in medicine and surgery at the Lviv National Medical University. He was rescued when Russia invaded a year ago - but decided to return last October to finish his degree. Image caption, Rishi Dwivedi worries that if the war escalates again he will need to fleeAfter a 22-year-old Indian medical student was killed in shelling at the start of the war, India evacuated 23,000 of its nationals who´d been trapped, including 18,000 students.But large numbers - most of them medics - have since gone back, defying government advice. They say they have little choice if they are to work as doctors.Mr Dwivedi is among 1,100 Indians currently living in Ukraine. Most are students in cities like Lviv, Uzhgorod and Ternopil in the west of the country - within range of Russian air attacks but a long way from fighting in the east.They´re not the only foreigners to return. The BBC met African students who´d gone back to Lviv, and others are considering whether they should too.‘No one’s coming to save us’: Indian students in Kharkiv""We wonder if we´ll be able to finish our course. When helicopters or planes fly over us, we are unable to sleep. We worry if there is going to be an attack,"" says Shrishti Moses, a medical student  in her fourth year in Lviv. Power supply is patchy, so Ms Moses, who´s from the northern Indian city of Dehradun, had to move to a more expensive apartment in a neighbourhood with regular electricity.Image source, EPAImage caption, The scene of a Russian attack in Lviv region last week - five people were killedGiven these conditions, why return to Ukraine?Experts say that most Indian medical students abroad want to return to their country after graduating. But for that, they need permission from the National Medical Commission (NMC), India´s medical education regulator. When the war forced these students out of their education, India´s education minister said the government would ""do everything possible"" to ""make them doctors"". The Indian Medical Association asked for such students to be accommodated in Indian colleges. State governments made similar demands.India students back from Ukraine left in the lurchIndia´s external affairs ministry even asked for ""Indian private medical institutions to enrol returnee students… on a one-time exceptional basis"". But the health ministry ruled otherwise. It said in July that there were no provisions to ""accommodate or transfer medical students from any foreign medical institutes to Indian medical colleges"".Many students who returned from Ukraine aren´t even seeking admission to Indian colleges - because of the fierce competition to gain entry and the high cost of medical courses.Image caption, Vaishali Sethia left Ukraine in March and returned in NovemberVaishali Sethia, who is studying medicine at the Ternopil National Medical University, left Ukraine via the Hungarian border in early March last year and returned in November.""The NMC had issued an order declaring that Indian students who had taken admission in foreign universities after November 2021 would have to finish the course in the same university if they wanted their degrees to be recognised in India,"" says Ms Sethia, who´s from Faridabad just outside Delhi. She said she gained admission in December 2021, just a couple of months before war forced her to leave.""People keep asking us why we returned Ukraine. We had to,"" she says. Indian students stuck in Ukraine desperate for helpLast month, India´s health ministry said 3,964 Indian students who were in Ukrainian universities when the war began, had shifted to universities mostly outside Ukraine. About 170 students have continued studying in Ukrainian universities that have temporarily shifted their operations to safer areas.The health ministry also announced that Indian students who had completed their medical course on or before 30 June 2022, were eligible to sit the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination - an exam for students who´ve graduated abroad and want a licence to practice in India. But all this means little to students who have now returned to Ukraine. Those who haven´t done so find themselves in a strange limbo.Image caption, Dipak Kumar and his mother, who is not in favour of him returning to UkraineDipak Kumar, who lives in India´s northern state of Bihar, says that though he would like to go back to Ukraine and resume his studies, he can´t because of family pressure.""My family opposes the move because they fear for my safety,"" he says.Dipak says he could have secured admission to a private medical college in India, but chose not to because of the high fees.""We did not even have the money required for Ukraine, so my father sold some of our land to pay my fees,"" he says. Students the BBC spoke to say that the fees for the entire medical course in Ukraine works out to be less than half of what it costs to study in a private institution in India.Mrityunjay Kumar, whose son Shashank has now returned to study in Lviv, says that while Indian private colleges charge around 7.2m rupees ($87,000; £72,000) for the course, in Ukraine it costs closer to 2.5m rupees.Back in Lviv, Rishi Dwivedi says he now gets less attention since going back. ""We students were in the limelight for the month that we returned. People then stopped bothering about us.""But every day is filled with uncertainty about the future.""We have told our parents that in case the war escalates again and we need to run, then we are on our own now. We will try and find our way out from nearby border areas,"" he says.Additional reporting by Claire Press & Kevin McGregor BBC News India is now on YouTube.

US drone downing: Russia will try to retrieve remnants of drone - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, US drone crash inevitable, Ukraine minister tells BBCBy Antoinette Radford and Jonathan Beale, defence correspondentBBC NewsRussia said on Wednesday that it would try to retrieve the remnants of a US drone that crashed into the Black Sea.The large MQ-9 Reaper drone plunged into the water on Tuesday.The US said it brought down the damaged drone after it became ""unflyable"" when a Russian jet clipped its propeller - but Moscow has denied these claims.Speaking on state television, Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev confirmed Moscow was attempting to find the aircraft.""I don´t know whether we´ll be able to retrieve it or not but it has to be done,"" Mr Patrushev said.He also said that the drone´s presence in the Black Sea was ""confirmation"" that the US was directly involved in the war.Senior Washington official John Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, ""their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised"".That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America´s top military general, who said the US has taken ""mitigating measures"" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.He said it would be challenging to retrieve the drone, noting the water where it crashed was anywhere between 4,000ft to 5,000ft (1,200m to 1,500m) deep.US military officials said the incident happened on Tuesday morning and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.In a statement, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was ""unflyable and uncontrollable"", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact with the US drone.Russia´s defence ministry said the drone crashed after a ""sharp manoeuvre"", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.The US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, confirmed he had spoken with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, the day after the drone was downed.In a statement released after the phonecall, Russia´s defence ministry said Mr Shoigu blamed the incident on ""increased reconnaissance activities against the interests of the Russian Federation"". It also called US drone flights off the coast of Crimea ""provocative"".The US drone crash is a moment fraught with dangerThe US and UK have previously gone to extraordinary lengths to recover their technology after crashes.They retrieved the wreckage of their stealth fighter jet, the F-35 from the bottom of the South China Sea after it sank.But on the face of it, the Pentagon seems more relaxed about losing a Reaper drone. It´s older technology and numerous have been lost before. And trying to recover a downed drone in deep waters, next to a war zone, with Russian ships and submarines patrolling, could present even greater risks of escalation. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia´s annexation of nearby Crimea in 2014.And since Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and the UK have stepped up surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. The lost Reaper may have been carrying a surveillance pod able to suck up electronic data such as radar emissions. The US Department of Defense said in a press release that the surveillance trips are used to gather information which helps improve security for Europe and supports ""allied partners"". The US has reportedly shared intelligence with Ukraine previously,  including to help it sink a Russian ship in the Black Sea.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspanUkraine´s foreign minister told BBC reporter James Landale that incidents such as the downing of a US drone over the Black Sea are inevitable until Russia leaves Crimea.Describing it as a ""routine incident"", Dmytro Kuleba said: ""As long as Russia controls Crimea, these kinds of incidents will be inevitable and the Black Sea will not be a safe place."" Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but the vast majority of countries still recognise it as part of Ukraine. The BBC asked Mr Kuleba if, following the drone incident, the US and other allies might become more cautious.""If the West wants to demonstrate its weakness, it should certainly demonstrate its cautiousness after an incident like this, but I don´t have a feeling that this is the mood in capitals,"" he replied.""The mood is not to escalate but nor is the mood to lean under the pressure - the physical or rhetorical pressure - of Russia.""US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed the military would ""continue to fly and operate"" wherever international law allows.The US drone crash is a moment fraught with dangerAfter being summoned to speak to officials in Washington, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Moscow saw the drone incident as ""a provocation"".From the Kremlin´s point of view Mr Antonov added: ""The unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern.""On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaCrimeaUnited StatesUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64961958,15,03,2023,bbc,russia
Makiivka: Russia blames missile attack on soldiers' mobile phone use - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mourners gather to lay flowers in memory of soldiers killed in MakiivkaBy Will Vernon in Moscow & Elsa Maishman in LondonBBC NewsRussia has said a new year missile attack that killed at least 89 Russian soldiers happened because troops were using mobile phones, defying a ban.Turning on the phones and massive use of them allowed the enemy to locate its target, officials said.Ukraine says 400 soldiers were killed - and another 300 wounded - in the attack on a college for conscripts in Makiivka, in the occupied Donetsk area. It is the largest number of deaths Russia has acknowledged in the war. Russia said that at 00:01 Moscow time on New Year´s Day, six rockets were fired from a US-made Himars rocket system at a vocational college, two of which were shot down. Moments earlier President Vladimir Putin had given his annual new year address on Russian TV.The deputy commander of the regiment, Lt Col Bachurin, was among those killed, the ministry of defence said in a statement on Wednesday. A commission was investigating the circumstances of the incident, the statement said. But it was ""already obvious"" that the main cause of the attack was the use of mobile phones by troops in range of Ukrainian weapons, despite this being banned, it added.""This factor allowed the enemy to locate and determine the co-ordinates of the location of military personnel for a missile strike.""Lt Gen Sergei Sevryukov said officials found responsible by the investigation would be brought to justice and ""all the necessary measures are currently being adopted to prevent this kind of tragic incident in the future"".Russians point fingers after deadliest Ukraine attackNYE in Putin’s Russia - nothing is normal Five ways Ukraine war could go in 2023The defence ministry´s statement was striking for two reasons. The military´s official death toll is now 89. The previous figure of 63 dead already represented the highest single loss of life Moscow had admitted since the war began. The real death toll in Makiivka could be much higher, as is claimed by both Ukraine and by unofficial Russian sources. Second, the statement said that ""responsible officials"" would be brought to justice, suggesting that something went wrong. This is highly unusual behaviour for Moscow - very rarely do authorities admit that errors have been made. The vocational college was packed with soldiers at the time - men believed to have been among the 300,000 called up in President Vladimir Putin´s partial mobilisation in September. Ammunition was also being stored close to the site, which was reduced to rubble.The head of Russia´s proxy authority in the Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, praised the heroism of those caught up in the missile strike, who he said had tried to pull comrades out of the building. Some of those returning to the building had died in the process, he added.With such a high official death toll, one would think the Russian military´s latest update on the horrific events in Makiivka would be the top story on Russian state TV news today. Not so. There was almost no mention of the story on Rossiya-24´s main bulletins this morning. Over on Channel One, the main news programme did briefly mention the defence ministry statement, but chose to bury it at the end of a report about alleged victories on the front line and losses amongst Ukrainian, not Russian, forces. ""A whole series of Russian missile attacks was unleashed on the first days of the new year against Ukrainian nationalists and foreign accomplices of the Kyiv regime,"" said the Channel One correspondent triumphantly, using common false narratives to describe Ukrainian forces. Image source, ReutersImage caption, The building housing the conscripts was all but flattened in the Ukrainian attackBut if you switch off the TV and log on to vKontakte, Russia´s version of Facebook, you get a very different picture. Communities have sprung up where soldiers´ relatives are organising, appealing for information and crowdfunding for troops on the front line. Here there is anger. Many relatives of the Makiivka soldiers blame military officials for the incident, and are sceptical of reports that those guilty will be punished. Some question why Kremlin-controlled media are largely silent on the story. However, there is little direct criticism of President Putin or of the war in general. Pavel Gubarev, a former leading official in Russia´s proxy authority in Donetsk, said the decision to house a large number of soldiers in one building was ""criminal negligence"". ""If no-one is punished for this, then it will only get worse,"" he warned.The deputy speaker of Moscow´s local parliament, Andrei Medvedev, said it was predictable that the soldiers would be blamed rather than the commander who made the original decision to put so many of them in one place. The defence ministry´s claim that military officials who were allegedly responsible for this disaster will be punished will be seen as an attempt to defuse public anger over the disaster in Makiivka, but also to place the blame firmly on the military, and not President Putin. He has yet to respond to the disaster so far, Throughout this war, the Kremlin has been careful to distance Russia´s president from any bad news coming from the front line. In November, Russia withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, a major strategic defeat for Moscow. The announcement to retreat, though, was made by Gen Sergei Surovikin, commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. President Putin was meanwhile pictured touring a neurological facility, and did not make any comment on the situation in Kherson.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Tuesday night that Moscow was ""on the eve of new mobilisation processes"". Declaring that ""their new offensive must fail"", Mr Zelensky said Ukraine had no doubt Russia would throw everything they had left and everyone they could muster in a bid to turn the tide of the war.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64159045,04,01,2023,bbc,russia
Putin in Mariupol: What the Russian president saw on his visit - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Russia´s President Putin tours Mariupol in occupied UkraineBy Sarah Fowler and James Landalein London and KyivDriving through the ruined city at night, Vladimir Putin has made his first visit to Mariupol - devastated when Russian forces besieged the city earlier on in the war.The BBC has traced part of the route he took, which passed near the locations of several notorious attacks during his army´s months-long assault. Russia finally overran the city in May.Video released by Russian media show Mr Putin chatting to a companion as they head towards the city´s concert hall. The Kremlin says the visit took place late on Saturday and Mr Putin decided ""spontaneously"" to tour the city.Mariupol´s Ukrainian mayor in exile Vadym Boychenko told the BBC that Mariupol was ""personal"" to Mr Putin because of what had happened there.""We have to understand that Mariupol is a symbolic place for Putin, because of the fury he inflicted on the city of Mariupol. No other city was destroyed like that. No other city was under siege for so long. No other city was subjected to carpet bombing,"" he said. ""He has come in person to see what he has done,"" he added.Driving past the scene of Russian attacksThe BBC identified some of the key landmarks along the Russian leader´s route. Mr Putin appears to be driving down Kuprina St, turning into Myru Avenue and then into Metalurhiv Avenue, where the Philharmonic Concert Hall is and which he visits later on in the footage. He is sitting next to a man in a black cap, who Russian media identify as Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin. On his left as they drive down Myru Avenue are sculptures of birds in what was Mariupol´s Freedom Square.Further on, on the right and not shown in the footage, is Mariupol´s Maternity Hospital Number Three, which was bombed in a notorious incident last March.Pictures of heavily-pregnant Marianna Vyshemirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps were widely shared amid outrage at the attack. She survived and gave birth the following day. Another pregnant woman was among the victims.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a war crime but Russia´s embassy in London claimed the hospital had no longer been in use, and was instead being used by members of the Azov regiment, which was set up as a volunteer militia with links to the far right in 2014 but had since been incorporated into Ukraine´s National Guard.Mr Putin turned off Myru Avenue just before the road arrives at Theatre Square - the scene of a deadly bombing that is thought to have killed at least 300 and possibly as many as 600 civilians.Civilians had been using the building as a refuge from the siege and a large sign spelling ""children"" had been daubed in Russian in front of the theatre. The building collapsed when it was hit. Russia denied bombing it and blamed the Azov battalion. In December the Ukrainian city authorities in exile said Russia was demolishing the ruins of the theatre. Russia ""understood where there was a concentration of people, and deliberately destroyed these places, killing people. They systematically worked on this"", said Mr Boychenko.Visits new Russia-built compound in outer MariupolFootage then shows Mr Putin on a walking tour of a new residential compound, said to be in Mariupol´s Nevsky district. He is guided by Mr Khusnullin, who shows him some plans of the reconstruction work. He is also seen talking to people said by Russian media to be local residents and he also visits an apartment that he is told is made up of three rooms. Nevsky is a new district comprising a dozen apartment blocks in the west of the city. It is named after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin´s home city of St Petersburg stands.Mayor Boychenko said many of the Russian-built buildings were on the city outskirts. ""They built this just to prove that their version of what´s happening there is true. But they lie! They lie that they came to liberate the city. But they destroyed it. This city does not exist any longer. And it takes 20 years to restore it!"" he said.Image source, ReutersMariupol residents have been telling the BBC that new buildings are going up and some of those damaged by the Russian military are being removed. The UN estimates that 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in the Russian onslaught.´You can rebuild Mariupol - you can´t bring back the dead´Norwegian journalist Morten Risberg, who visited Mariupol in December, said he saw ""large-scale rebuilding and restoration"" amid ""destruction everywhere you looked"".""They´re changing street names and they´re painting over Ukrainian colours with Russian colours, and they´re putting Russian flags everywhere,"" he told the BBC. Most of the remaining civilians in the city were ""just focusing on surviving"", he said. Walking through Mariupol´s Philharmonic concert hallIn another part of the footage, President Putin is seen walking through the interior of a concert hall in Mariupol. Russian state media said it was the Philharmonic Concert Hall - and the BBC has verified that the footage matches the interior of the venue. This is the same building that the UN warned was to be used to stage trials of Ukrainian troops who held out against Russian forces for months in Mariupol´s massive Azovstal iron and steel plant. Russia finally gained complete control of Mariupol in May after the defenders surrendered.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The concert hall was to be the venue for show trials of Ukrainian POWs but they were traded in a prisoner swap insteadImages posted on social media in August - including by Ukrainian authorities - appeared to show metal cages being built on the stage. According to the UN, prosecuting prisoners of war (POWs) for taking part in hostilities is a war crime.But the trials never took place, as the POWs were later part of a prisoner swap for 55 prisoners from Ukraine, including a pro-Kremlin former MP, Viktor Medvedchuk.The latest footage from inside the concert hall shows the interior of the building has since been redecorated and the cages are no longer visible.During the siege the concert hall, like the drama theatre, was used by civilians for shelter. The cultural institutions were ""where people hid in basements and waited for the Russian terror to end,"" Mr Boychenko said.Before the invasion it had been the venue for the Mariupol Classic festival for classical music. Mr Boychenko said the festival was a ""great celebration of classical music for the people of Mariupol"" that drew artists from abroad and other parts of Ukraine.""Many people always gathered at this festival to feel the mood that always prevailed in Mariupol,"" he said.In a later shot, President Putin is seen visiting a World War Two memorial built to commemorate Soviet troops who recaptured the city from Nazi Germany.Additional reporting by the BBC´s Osint reporter Benedict GarmanRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65007289,19,03,2023,bbc,russia
Lukashenko warns Belarus will join Russia in war if attacked - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Lukashenko is a key ally of Mr Putin and has previously defended the war in UkraineBy Steve RosenbergRussia Editor in MinskFew people know Vladimir Putin quite as well as Alexander Lukashenko does. The authoritarian leader of Belarus is a firm Kremlin ally and backer of what Mr Putin refers to as the ""special military operation"" - what most of the world calls Russia´s war in Ukraine.Since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago, Mr Putin hasn´t sat down with Western journalists. But today in Minsk, Mr Lukashenko took questions from a small group of foreign media, including the BBC.""Last year you allowed your country to be used as a staging ground for Russia´s invasion,"" I reminded Mr Lukashenko. ""Are you prepared to do so again?"" ""Yes, I´m ready,"" he replied. ""I´m ready to provide [territory] again. I´m also ready to wage war, alongside the Russians, from the territory of Belarus. But only if someone - even a single soldier - enters our territory from there (Ukraine) with weapons to kill my people.""Military co-operation between Russia and Belarus has been on the increase, with joint drills and the formation of a joint military grouping. But so far the Belarusian leader has avoided sending his troops into Ukraine to fight alongside Russian forces.The UK, EU and the United States do not recognise Alexander Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus. In 2020 Belarusians poured on to the streets to accuse him of stealing the country´s presidential election. The protests were brutally suppressed.Mr Lukashenko used Thursday´s event to blame the West for the war in Ukraine. He accused Western governments of fuelling the conflict and engaged in a touch of Putinesque nuclear sabre-rattling,""If you continue this escalation, you will get nuclear weapons and Russia has more than anyone,"" he said.""So, you should stop this. If a nuclear war starts, Belarus will cease to exist. We need to sit down at the negotiating table, because nuclear war will wipe out the USA too. No-one needs this.""Image source, ReutersImage caption, Belarus shares a border with Ukraine and Russia sent troops from there when it launched its invasionHaving facilitated the Russian invasion of Ukraine one year ago, the Belarusian leader now claims he can help negotiate peace. Mr Lukashenko suggested that next week would be a good time to start, with US President Joe Biden due to visit Poland.""I invite [President Biden] to Belarus,"" Mr Lukashenko said. ""It´s not far from Warsaw, Thirty minutes and he´ll be in Minsk. He could land his plane here. I will persuade the president of Russia to come. I invite him too to Minsk, as well as Biden. We will sit down and reach an agreement."" It is an invitation the US president is likely to decline.

German man arrested for allegedly passing intelligence to Russia - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The man is thought to be an acquaintance of a German foreign intelligence service worker who was arrested last monthBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsA German citizen has been arrested on suspicion of treason for alleged involvement in a scheme to pass intelligence to Russia.The man, named only as Arthur E, was arrested on Sunday at Munich airport with the help of the FBI. He´s thought to be linked to a German foreign intelligence service (BND) employee who was arrested in December for allegedly spying for Russia.Prosecutors have said Arthur E doesn´t work for the intelligence services.Instead, they believe he passed on information from his acquaintance - the detained BND officer known as Carsten L because of privacy rules - to the Kremlin, making him an alleged accomplice to treason. The alleged double agent was later found guilty of handing over documents to the CIA and Russian intelligence, and sentenced to eight years in prison.His arrest in December was the first time a BND employee had been arrested for suspected treason since Markus Reichel was detained in 2014. Suspected Russian spy held by German intelligenceArthur E arrived back in Germany where he was arrested after travelling from the United States.It comes at a time of increased concerns about Russian espionage in Europe following the invasion of Ukraine last February. Germany´s cybersecurity chief was fired in October after the media accused him of having had links with people involved with Russian intelligence services.The following month, a man was found guilty of passing information to Russian intelligence services while working as a reserve officer for the German army.Related TopicsGermanySpyingRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64415814,26,01,2023,bbc,russia
How are 'kamikaze' drones being used by Russia and Ukraine? - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Wreckage of a Shahed-136 (or Geranium-2) kamikaze drone shot down by the UkrainiansRussia is planning to ""exhaust"" Ukraine with attacks using Iranian-made drones, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.It has been accused of launching waves of so-called ""kamikaze"" drones against Ukrainian cities and power stations in recent months. What is Russia´s ´kamikaze´ drone?Ukraine´s government and Western intelligence agencies say Russia has been using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the conflict since autumn last year.Also called the Geranium-2 by Russia, it has explosives in a warhead on its nose and is designed to loiter over a target until it is instructed to attack.The Shahed-136 has a wingspan of about 2.5m (8.2ft) and can be hard to detect on radar. Iran´s government says it supplied ""a small number"" of drones to Russia before the war.But the US and the European Union have accused Iran of sending regular deliveries of drones to Russia, and the EU has imposed sanctions in response. Defence experts think Russia may be using Shahed-136 drones rather than cruise missiles for air attacks because they are relatively cheap - about $20,000 (£17,800) each. What damage have kamikaze drones done in Ukraine?Russia was first reported to have used a Shahed-136 drone on 13 September, attacking military targets in the Kharkiv region in the east of the country.Since then, Russia has made repeated attacks with drones on both military and civilian targets in the areas of Kyiv, Odesa and Mykolaiv. Ukraine says Russia launched more than 80 Iranian-made Shahed drones on 1 January and 2 January, but claims to have shot all of them down.Russia often targets power stations, to deprive Ukraine´s population of electricity and heating during the winter months. How is Ukraine trying to combat them? Ukrainian armed forces have used small arms fire, heavy machine guns, portable anti-air missiles and electronic jamming devices to try and shoot down drones. This can be difficult when they are sent in large numbers, or ""swarms"".However, Ukraine says its air defences have managed to shoot down over 80% of all the drones Russia has sent against it. Has Ukraine used ´kamikaze´ drones?The US has said it is supplying Ukraine with 700 of its Switchblade kamikaze drones, but it is not known whether any have yet been used.Experts say Ukraine used kamikaze drones of some sort last autumn to attack a Russian military base in western Crimea, an airbase near Sevastopol, and ships in Sevastopol harbour.Russia says Ukraine also used kamikaze drones in December for three separate attacks on airbases at Saratov and Ryazan - both hundreds of miles inside Russian territory.What other drones do Ukraine and Russia have?Ukraine´s main military drone is the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2. It is about the size of a small plane, has cameras on board, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs.A Bayraktar drone was used in the attack which sank the Russian warship Moskva in the Black Sea in April 2022.Russia also uses the smaller, more basic Orlan-10, which has cameras and can carry small bombs. How have military drones been used?  For both sides - Russia and Ukraine - drones have been effective for locating enemy targets and guiding artillery fire toward them.In the past, observers might have had to spend 20 or 30 minutes pinpointing a target, says Dr Jack Watling, defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute.Now, however, he says: ""Russian forces can bring their guns to bear on the enemy within only three to five minutes of an Orlan-10 drone spotting the target.""Dr Marina Miron, defence researcher at Kings College London, says drones have allowed Ukraine to stretch its limited forces.""If you wanted to seek out enemy positions in the past, you would have had to send out special forces units... and you might have lost some troops,"" she says. ""Now, all you´re risking is a drone.""Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian Orlan-10 drones can target artillery fire on enemy positions within minutesThe main problem in using military drones is that they are large and slow moving, and are easy to shoot down. They are also expensive to replace - a single Bayraktar TB2 costs about $2m (£1.7m).How are non-military drones being used?Both sides in the war - but especially Ukraine - have increasingly been using small, cheap commercial models of drone such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs about £1,700. These can be fitted with small bombs, but are mainly used to spot enemy troops and to direct attacks.However, commercial drones are much less capable than military ones. For example, the DJI Mavic´s total flying distance is only 30km, and it can only fly for a maximum of 46 minutes. Russia is using electronic devices to counter them, says Dr Miron.""Russian forces have the Stupor rifle, which shoots electromagnetic pulses,"" she says. This stops commercial drones from being able to navigate using GPS, she explains.Russian forces have also used online systems, such as Aeroscope, to detect and interrupt communications between commercial drones and their operators.These systems can cause a drone to crash or return to base, and can stop it sending back information.

Finland starts construction of Russia border fence - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Finnish Border GuardImage caption, Work on the fence at the Imatra border crossing started on TuesdayBy George WrightBBC NewsFinland has begun constructing a 200km (124 mile) fence on its border with Russia to boost security. The Border Guard said it will be 3m (10ft) tall with barbed wire on top.Finland shares the longest European Union border with Russia, at 1,340km (832 miles). At present, Finland´s borders are secured primarily by light wooden fences.Finland decided to build the fence due to a rise in Russians seeking to escape conscription to fight in Ukraine.The Nordic country also moved closer to joining the Nato alliance on Tuesday. Its parliament started debating a bill to speed up the country´s bid, with a vote expected on Wednesday.Work on the fence at the Imatra border crossing started on Tuesday with forest clearance, while road construction and fence installation are planned to start in March. Night vision cameras, lights and loudspeakers will be installed in certain sections of the fence.A 3km pilot project at Imatra is expected to be completed by the end of June, the Border Guard said. Finland passed new amendments to its Border Guard Act in July to allow the building of stronger fences. The current wooden fences are mainly to prevent livestock crossing the border.Since Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Finland has sought to strengthen its eastern border. In September, large numbers of Russians started fleeing to Finland after President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilisation of reservists to fight in Ukraine.What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine?Following Russia´s invasion on 24 February last year, both Finland and Sweden decided they wanted to join Nato as soon as possible, after being neutral for years.But Helsinki faces fewer diplomatic hurdles than Stockholm, and the Finnish government wants to move forward even before Finland´s general elections in April. Only Turkey and Hungary have yet to approve the Finnish and Swedish bids to join the defensive bloc.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSwedenRussiaFinland",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64802457,28,02,2023,bbc,russia
Newspaper headlines: 'Back to work budget' and 'Russia downs US drone' - BBC News,"By BBC NewsStaffImage source, UK governmentImage caption, Jeremy Hunt is set to deliver his first budget as chancellorExpectations for the Budget dominate Wednesday´s papers. The Financial Times says the chancellor will announce billions of pounds to boost business investment as part of what he´ll call a ""budget for growth"". A Conservative official tells the paper that Jeremy Hunt´s statement will be ""deliberately cautious"" - and MPs on the right of the party have been warned not to expect big tax cuts.   The Daily Telegraph reports that Mr Hunt will likely trigger a backbench rebellion by going ahead with a planned increase in corporation tax. The Sun´s leader column says there´s a danger that foreign firms could be driven out of the UK because of a desperation by Number Eleven to balance the books. The Times says Boris Johnson is among those calling for the increase to be scrapped - despite it being announced while he was prime minister. Jeremy Hunt will use a carrot-and-stick approach, according to the Daily Express, with tough sanctions on benefits claimants who refuse to get a job. For the Daily Mail, it´s a ""back to work"" budget whose boldest offering is a massive extension of free childcare. The Guardian sees this as an attempt to match a Labour pledge to come up with bold childcare policies before the next election. The Daily Mirror urges the Chancellor to tackle inequality rather than stick to what it calls failed policies that favour the rich. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Scientists have warned about the increasing number of fossils and dinosaur skeletons falling into private handsThe Guardian also reports on a sharp rise in the number of scientists and post-graduate students who´ve been barred from working in the UK on national security grounds. More than 1,100 rejections were made by Foreign Office vetting last year, according to data seen by the paper. In 2016, the figure was just 13. The Guardian says it follows a hardening of the government´s stance on research collaborations with China. A government spokesperson tells the paper that the rate of refusals remains low, at about 2%. With the headline ""Heartless"" the Sun´s front page reports that the BBC has been sending TV licence enforcement letters to the York home of Claudia Lawrence, the university chef who´s been missing for 14 years. Her mother´s told the paper the letters have caused ""untold heartache"". The TV Licencing Authority tells the Sun that a hold´s been put on further deliveries and that it´s sorry for any distress caused.The Times reports on fear among scientists that a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton up for auction next month will become the latest invaluable fossil to be consigned to the private gallery of an ultra-wealthy collector. The skeleton is expected to fetch up to £7.2 million. The paper says that the figure is far beyond the means of any museum. One academic says the sale is the tip of ""a very ugly iceberg"" where everyone who is interested in the natural world loses. Finally the Daily Mail reveals that trendy cat cafes might not be the healthiest place for our feline friends. A study´s found they have a higher rate of sickness than those in foster care - in part caused by the stress of many different people visiting the cafes at unpredictable times.

Serbia nationalist protests spike tensions over Russia - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Police blocked far-right leader Damjan Knezevic as he and other protesters tried to storm the presidencyBy Joe Inwood & Albana KasapiBBC Newsnight, BelgradePro-Russia activists in Serbia joined nationalist protesters outside the presidency this week, in the latest indication of rising Russian influence.Chanting ""no surrender"" and ""treason"", they threatened to riot if Serbia backed an EU plan to normalise relations with Kosovo.President Alexander Vucic denounced the protesters as ""anti-Serbian"".The government said it did not believe Moscow stoked the protests but the war has heightened tensions in Belgrade.Death threats were made towards the president if he signed a deal on Kosovo and three men have been charged with calling for a violent change of Serbia´s constitutional order.Among them is Serbian far-right leader Damjan Knezevic, who organised the protests. He has publicly backed Russia´s Wagner mercenary group, which has played a big role in Russia´s war in Ukraine.He was recently pictured visiting Wagner´s Russian headquarters in St Petersburg. Another man was arrested apparently taking a sniper rifle to the protest.Mr Vucic went on TV to accuse the protest organisers of being paid for with foreigners´ cash, vowing that Serbia would never be defeated by lies, threats and a few rifles. ""I don´t need someone from Wagner to tap me on the shoulder and tell me what I can and can´t do,"" he said.The Russian ambassador condemned threats against the Serbian leader. But almost a year into the war in Ukraine, it is clear Serbia is struggling to maintain ties with Moscow while moving closer to the EU.WATCH: Serbia: The Russia Dilemma""I would do anything for Mother Serbia and Mother Russia. They are the same thing,"" said Vlado Stanic, wearing a T-shirt showing a stern-faced Vladimir Putin and his well-known quote on the invasion: ""Everything is going according to plan.""Stanic displays an extreme version of a more common mindset, a form of Pan-Slavism that believes Serbia has historic and religious links to Russia.He speaks of ""Tsar Putin"" in almost messianic terms, parroting Russian propaganda about its fight against ""fascists and Nazis"". In 2015 he travelled to eastern Ukraine to help Russian forces. Image source, Vlado StanicImage caption, Vlado Stanic served a jail sentence in Serbia after he joined Russian forces fighting in eastern UkraineHe refuses to speak about what he did in Ukraine´s Donbas region, but on his return to Serbia was sent to jail.Cedomir Stoikovic, who is one of Serbia´s leading voices against Russian influence, warns that Serbia is under ""hybrid occupation"", which has resulted in in the widespread support that Russia now enjoys.""For 15 years Russia has conducted a huge operation in Serbia. Their intelligence service is here on a massive scale. They put money here, buying media and news editors.""He has tried to launch prosecutions against the Russian ambassador and the Wagner group and is now defending a young Ukrainian woman he claims has been unfairly treated because of her nationality.The claims are difficult to prove but news coverage of the Russian war in Serbia is often dramatically at odds with other European countries.One newspaper ran a story in the run-up to the invasion with the infamous headline ""Ukraine attacks Russia"". Another ran a front-page story claiming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused the West of ""betraying"" Ukraine, when he had said nothing of the sort.  Serbia is something of an outlier among European nations in its support for Russia. It has refused to join Western sanctions, although President Vucic has condemned Russia´s invasion.Vlad, a souvenir seller in Belgrade´s central Kalemegdan park, is doing a brisk trade in pro-Moscow T-shirts. One bears the Z logo that has become the hallmark of Russia´s war. Another bestseller boasts President Putin riding a bear.""It isn´t Russia against Ukraine, it is Russia against Nato,"" he asserts, reiterating another Putin mantra.Many in Serbia have never forgiven the West´s defensive alliance for 1999 airstrikes against the forces of Slobodan Milosevic. They brought to an end to Serbia´s brutal ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo, but also caused a lingering hatred amongst many Serbs.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Kosovo celebrated 15 years of independence on Friday but it is not recognised by SerbiaKosovo is the theme that runs through all of this and a Nato-led force is still based there. Considered by many here to be an essential part of Serbian territory, Kosovo declared independence 15 years ago, a result of years of ethnic tension, bloody conflict and genocidal attacks.Relations have been fraught, and Serbia does not recognise Kosovo as an independent state, nor do the 50,000 ethnic Serbs who live there.But later this month, President Vucic will meet Kosovo´s prime minister in Brussels with the US and EU hoping that they sign a peace plan that would send Serbia further on the road towards joining the European Union, and further out of Russia´s orbit.Joe Inwood reports for BBC Newsnight and Albana Kasapi for The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4.Related TopicsSerbiaKosovoTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished4 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished1 hour agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished55 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

RAF and German jets intercept Russian aircraft near Estonian airspace - BBC News,"Image source, Ministry of DefenceImage caption, The mission was carried out by two Typhoon fighter jets (file photo)By Christy CooneyBBC NewsRAF and German fighter jets have intercepted a Russian aircraft near Estonian airspace in the first joint operation of its kind.The two Typhoons were scrambled on Tuesday to intercept an Il-78 Midas refuelling plane flying between St Petersburg and Kaliningrad.The plane had failed to communicate with air traffic control in Estonia.The British and German air forces are currently conducting planned joint Nato air policing in the region. The interception itself was routine, but it is the first time such an operation has been carried out together by the two countries. The incident comes amid heightened tensions between Nato and Russia over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, although there is no evidence of any link with Tuesday´s reported collision between a Russian fighter jet and a US drone over the Black Sea. After escorting the Midas, the two jets were redirected to intercept an An-148 airliner that was also passing close to Estonian airspace.The jets are part of the RAF´s 140 Expeditionary Air Wing and the German 71 Tactical Air Wing Richthofen.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, An IL-78 Midas jet (right) flying alongside two other Russian planes (file photo)The RAF is preparing to take the lead on Nato´s long-established Baltic air policing mission from the German air force in April. It will then lead the mission for four months, with joint British and German operations set to continue until the end of April. Four RAF Typhoon jets are currently deployed as part of the mission and are based at the Ämari air base in Estonia.Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey said: ""Nato continues to form the bedrock of our collective security.

Deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia is war crime - UN - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Over 16,000 children are thought to have been transferred to Russia or Russia-controlled areas.By Laura GozziBBC NewsRussia´s forced deportation of Ukrainian children to areas under its control amounts to a war crime, UN investigators have said.The UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine said there was evidence of the illegal transfer of hundreds of Ukrainian children to Russia.The Commission´s report is categorical that Russia also committed other war crimes in Ukraine. They include attacks on hospitals, torture, rape and wilful killings.Ukraine government figures put the number of children forcibly taken to Russia at 16,221.Russia has introduced policies such as the granting of Russian citizenship and the placement of children in foster families to ""create a framework in which some of the children may end up remaining permanently"" in Russia, the report notes.While the transfers were supposed to be temporary ""most became prolonged"", with both parents and children facing ""an array of obstacles in establishing contact"", UN investigators wrote. In some cases, parents or children told the Commission that once in Russia-controlled areas, transferred children were made to wear ""dirty clothes, were screamed at, and called names."" They also said that ""some children with disabilities did not receive adequate care and medication.""The burden of contacting their parents fell primarily to the transferred children as the adults faced ""considerable logistical, financial, and security challenges"" in finding or retrieving their children, the report says.It also quotes witnesses as saying that the smaller children transferred may have not been able to establish contact with their families and might, as a consequence, ""lose contact with them indefinitely"".The forced deportations of Ukrainian children ""violate international humanitarian law, and amount to a war crime"", concludes the report.The UN said that in addition to the rapes, killings and ""widespread"" torture, Moscow could be responsible for the even more serious ""crimes against humanity"" - notably the wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine´s energy infrastructure that began last October. The commission is also trying to determine whether the bombing and siege of the city of Mariupol last May might constitute a crime against humanity.The investigators said they had also documented ""a small number"" of violations committed by Ukrainian armed forces.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUnited Nations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64985009,16,03,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: Russia's Wagner boss suggests 'betrayal' in Bakhmut battle - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group, speaking in Bakhmut in a video released on 3 MarchBy Aoife WalshBBC NewsThe head of Russia´s Wagner private army says it is not getting the ammunition it needs from Moscow, as it seeks to gain control of Bakhmut. The eastern city has seen months of intense fighting, as Wagner and regular Russian troops try to seize it. But Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin says his army´s lack of ammunition could be ""ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal"".Ukraine´s president and military commanders have agreed to strengthen their defence of Bakhmut. Russia has appeared determined to capture the city for months, but many analysts say it has become a symbolic prize in the war and has little strategic value.An apparent rivalry between the mercenaries and the regular Russian army seems to have intensified in recent weeks, and this is not the first time Mr Prigozhin has accused the Russian defence ministry of withholding the ammunition it needs. In a social media post on Sunday, Mr Prigozhin said documents had been signed on 22 February, with ammunition expected to be sent to Bakhmut the next day.But most had not been shipped, he said, before suggesting it could be deliberate.And in a further sign of the rift, on Monday Mr Prigozhin said his representative was unable to access the headquarters of Russia´s military command. It is unclear where the headquarters is located. Mr Prigozhin said it came after he wrote to the chief of Russia´s ""special military operation"", Valery Gerasimov, about the ""urgent necessity to give us ammunition"".Separately, in a video uploaded on Saturday - but seemingly filmed in February - Mr Prigozhin said his men feared that they were being ""set up"" as scapegoats in case Russia lost its war in Ukraine. ""If we step back, we will go down in history as the people who took the main step to lose the war,"" he said.""And this is precisely the problem with the shell hunger [ammunition shortage]. This is not my opinion, but that of ordinary fighters... ""What if they [the Russian authorities] want to set us up, saying that we are scoundrels - and that´s why they are not giving us ammunition, not giving us weapons, and not letting us replenish our personnel, including [recruiting] prisoners?""In Saturday´s video, Mr Prigozhin also said Russia´s front line would collapse without his troops.He suggested Wagner fighters were taking on the ""entire Ukrainian army... destroying it"" and depriving it of the chance to concentrate on other parts of the front.What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries in Ukraine?Ukraine´s troops were probably conducting a ""limited fighting withdrawal"" in eastern Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Monday. But it added Ukraine was ""continuing to inflict high casualties"" on Russian forces.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country´s military commanders supported continuing operations to defend and strengthen positions in Bakhmut. In a statement, President Zelensky´s office said he had held a meeting with Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine´s armed forces, and Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the country´s ground forces.They spoke ""in favour of continuing the defensive operation and further strengthening our positions in Bakhmut"". On Saturday, the deputy mayor of Bakhmut told the BBC that there was street fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.However Oleksandr Marchenko said Russian troops had not yet gained control.""They have no goal to save the city... their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.Separately, Moscow´s Mr Shoigu has visited the occupied city of Mariupol during a trip to eastern Ukraine - a year after his troops besieged the city. The defence ministry said he was inspecting work carried out to ""restore infrastructure in the Donbas"" - words that are likely to grate in Ukraine, given Russia´s responsibility for the destruction.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64859780,06,03,2023,bbc,russia
Entire Russian spy network dismantled in Poland - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Joe Biden flew into the airport at Rzeszow-Jasionka, reportedly targeted by the groupBy Adam EastonBBC News, WarsawPoland has charged six foreign citizens with preparing acts of sabotage and spying for Russia, interior minister Mariusz Kaminski has said.Mr Kaminski said the six were ""foreigners from across the eastern border"" and they had sought to disrupt military and aid supplies to Ukraine.Prosecutors are currently preparing proceedings against three other people also detained in the operation. Mr Kaminski said the cell had been preparing ""sabotage actions"" in Poland.""Evidence indicates that this group monitored railway lines. Their tasks included recognising, monitoring and documenting weapons´ transports to Ukraine,"" Mr Kaminski told a news briefing on Thursday morning. ""The suspects were also preparing sabotage actions aimed at paralysing the supply of equipment, weapons and aid to Ukraine.""Six of the suspects have been charged with conducting espionage for Russia and participation in an organised criminal group, after they were detained as part of an operation conducted by Poland´s Internal Security Agency (ABW). ABW officers found cameras, electronic equipment and GPS transmitters that were to be mounted on aid transports to Ukraine.The group were also tasked with carrying out propaganda activities to disrupt Polish-Ukrainian relations and incite hostile attitudes towards Poland among Nato, Mr Kaminski said.ABW has evidence the group were paid by Russian intelligence. On Wednesday, the Polish radio station, RMF FM reported that some cameras were found near the small regional Rzeszow-Jasionka airport, which has been converted into an international logistics hub supplying military and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine.Military and cargo aircraft from the US and across Europe regularly fly in and out of the airport, where American troops can be seen beside their Humvees, to deliver supplies to waiting trucks that make the 100km (62 mile) journey to the Ukrainian border.The site is considered so sensitive, Washington has deployed US Patriot air defence systems to protect the airfield. Last month, US President Joe Biden landed at the airport on his way to Kyiv.The decades-long spy conflict between Russia and the West has intensified since the Ukraine war. Poland is one of Ukraine´s strongest allies and its security forces have arrested several people on suspicion of spying for Russia since the invasion last February.Last month, prosecutors charged a Russian citizen, who is a long-term resident in Poland, with spying for Russia between 2015 and 2022. The man, who ran a business in Poland, was allegedly involved with historical reconstruction groups, where he made contacts with Polish military personnel. He was arrested in April last year following an investigation that found he allegedly collected information on the organisational structure of Polish military units in the north-east of the country.A Spanish national of Russian origin, who was identified as an agent for Russia´s military intelligence agency (GRU) was arrested in Przemysl, south-eastern Poland, by the ABW last year on suspicion of spying for Moscow. In March last year, a Polish employee of the Warsaw Registry Office, identified as Tomasz L., was arrested on suspicion of transferring operationally valuable data to the Russian intelligence services.Additional reporting by Bartosz KielakRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSpyingRussiaPoland",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64975200,16,03,2023,bbc,russia
"Russia is still India's largest arms supplier, says report - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, India has had a close defence relationship with Russia for many yearsRussia continues to be India´s largest arms supplier, even though its share of Indian defence imports fell from 62% to 45% between 2017-2022, a report says.France came second with 29% of Indian arms imports, displacing the US at 11%, said the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).Its researchers found India remains the world´s largest arms buyer, despite an 11% drop in its total weapons imports.Delhi wants to diversify its imports portfolio and boost domestic capacity.Experts say the drop in Russian imports can be largely attributed to India´s decision to look for new suppliers and also encourage its local manufacturing. Sipri said that Russia´s position as India´s main arm supplier was ""under pressure due to strong competition from other supplier states, increased Indian arms production"" and ""constraints on Russia´s arms exports related to its invasion of Ukraine"". Meanwhile, France´s defence exports to India increased by 489% between 2013-17 and 2018-22, the report said. France ranks third in the list of global arms exporters - behind the US and Russia, but ahead of China and Germany.Delhi´s orders to France included around 62 combat aircraft and four submarines, Sipri said. The fall in Russia´s share coincides with calls for Delhi to take tougher a stand on the Ukraine war.Moscow has been a time tested ally of India and the two countries have shared a close defence relationship for decades - the Indian Army is equipped with Russian-made tanks and rifles, while its air force uses Sukhoi fighter jets and Mi-17 helicopters.Delhi has not explicitly condemned the Ukraine war but has talked about the importance of ""the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"".

Russia: Putin's Kremlin targets LGBT in new crackdown - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage caption, Danya has made a difficult decision to leave Russia after the country passed a new law targeting LGBT peopleBy Will VernonBBC News, St Petersburg""I´m the only monster drag queen in Russia,"" Danya proudly tells me as he applies ghostly-white make-up in front of a mirror. We´re sitting in his kitchen, a rainbow flag adorning the wall.Danya´s act is horror-themed - think Halloween meets drag. The 22-year-old regularly performed at a queer club night in St Petersburg called Gender Blender. But the project has now cancelled its shows after a new anti-LGBT law was passed by the Russian Parliament in December. Danya´s work has all but dried up.""According to the law, it´s forbidden to do what we´re doing,"" Danya says. ""We´re a lot more anxious now. The risks are much higher.""The new law bans ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations"" amongst all age groups. Anyone caught committing this ""offence"" could be fined up to 400,000 roubles ($5,840; £4,730), with much higher fines for organisations or journalists.Since the law was passed, Danya has decided to leave Russia and move to France. He says that living in a country where it´s illegal to ""just be yourself"" makes him feel afraid. ""My hands are tied. I just don´t have a choice anymore. Either I leave the country, or stay here and wait for it to get even worse. What´s happening now - it´s very frightening.""Image caption, Danya says his performances are loved by audiences in St Petersburg´s clubsThe bill began its journey through the Russian legislative system last summer, shortly after Moscow launched its so-called special military operation. The timing is no accident: Vladimir Putin says that Russia is not only fighting Ukraine on the battlefield, but also ""Western"" values. During a speech in the Kremlin to mark the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the president lashed out at the West and LGBT rights, calling them ""pure Satanism"".LGBT activist Piotr Voskresensky says the link to the war in Ukraine is ""obvious"". In his flat in central St Petersburg, he shows me the exhibits from his short-lived LGBT museum - Russia´s first. He opened the exhibition to the public in September last year but had to close it again once the new law passed. He says the law is an attempt by the Kremlin to divert the public´s attention away from setbacks on the battlefield. ""The war is lost, the economy is destroyed, and the authorities need to show people what they have risked their lives for,"" says Piotr. ""And the best idea they have is to find a new scapegoat - LGBT people.""Image caption, Piotr Voskresensky´s flat is full of exhibits from his now-closed LGBT museumThis is not the first law to place restrictions on Russia´s queer community. Ten years ago, a bill was passed banning so-called ""gay propaganda"" in relation to children. Human rights groups say that it was followed by a rise in violent homophobic attacks in Russia. Olga Baranova, from Moscow Community Centre for LGBT+ Initiatives, told me that the new law will further stigmatise LGBT people. ""We will go fully underground, there will be fictitious marriages, fictitious families. The privileged ones will leave the country. Those that can´t leave the country will go underground and look for partners somehow - using closed channels.""The worry now amongst the LGBT community is how, when and against whom the law will be applied. Russian legislation is notoriously vague, giving the authorities a blunt instrument that can be applied arbitrarily. But the fear generated by the legislation is already leading to censorship: online cinemas have deleted LGBT-themed films and TV series and edited out gay scenes. In one episode of the highly-acclaimed HBO series The White Lotus, a Russian streaming service changed the word ""gay"" to ""man"", edited in a towel onto one male character´s bare backside and deleted a gay sex scene, just days after the law was adopted.Image caption, The book Shattered, about the romance between two men, has been heavily redacted in RussiaBooks, too, are being censored. Shops across the country have withdrawn titles with LGBT themes and characters from sale. In one St Petersburg bookshop, I find a recently-released title, Shattered - a tale of romance between two men. As the book is wrapped in plastic, I must buy it to look inside. The text has been redacted by the publisher, with whole sections replaced with black lines.One of the co-authors of the law, an openly homophobic nationalist called Vitaly Milonov, agrees to speak to me via videolink. He is allegedly in the city of Horlivka in occupied eastern Ukraine, having travelled to the frontline as a volunteer fighter. He dismisses accusations that the law is discriminatory, saying people´s private lives will be respected. At a time when thousands are dying in Ukraine, Russia is isolated internationally and people are fleeing this country, I ask him whether it´s appropriate to be focussing on an LGBT law. ""Russia is not being isolated, we have a conflict with the Western world!"" Mr Milonov says. ""Why should you point at us that we have the wrong ideology? I think it is our sovereign right to have legislation that we like to have.""Back in Danya´s flat, he shows me some of the costumes he has lovingly designed for his drag act. The audiences in the St Petersburg clubs love his alternative performance, he says. He doesn´t want to leave this country. ""In what kind of a Russia can you imagine wanting to live?"" I ask him. ""A free Russia,"" he tells me, thinking about the question carefully. ""One that doesn´t undermine the most basic human rights that every person should have. Because I think my orientation is my right from birth, and no-one has the right to cancel, ban it, or prosecute me for it.""Produced by Liza ShuvalovaRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warHuman rights in RussiaRussiaSt PetersburgLGBTVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64345693,23,01,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: Russia again fires missiles over Moldova in latest strikes - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Residents of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv took shelter in metro stations amid Friday´s Russian attackBy Abdujalil Abdurasulov in Kyiv and James FitzGerald in LondonBBC NewsRussia´s latest aerial attack on Ukraine saw missiles cross Moldovan airspace, Ukrainian and Moldovan officials have said.Kyiv´s top general said missiles also flew above Romania - a claim denied by Romania, but later repeated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Mr Zelensky said the missiles represented a ""challenge"" to Nato, of which Romania is a member country.A Russian government spokesperson deflected questions about the incident. During a regular call with journalists, Dmitry Peskov told the BBC it was a matter for the defence ministry, which is yet to comment.Moldova´s country´s defence ministry described the missile flyover as a ""violation"", and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation - having done the same following a similar incident in October.The incident occurred on a day of political turbulence in Chisinau, during which the whole government resigned.For its part, Romania insisted that Russian missiles had not strayed into its airspace ""at any time"".But Mr Zelensky doubled down on the Ukrainian military´s Romanian claim, writing that the Russian missiles posed questions for ""collective security"". In a post on the Telegram messaging app, he added there were ""victims"" of the assault, without specifying a number.The Ukrainian air force said 71 missiles were fired in Friday´s ""massive"" attack, of which it shot down 61.In the aftermath, an aide of Mr Zelensky reiterated a call for the West to donate fighter jets, and criticised ""political hesitation"" over the provision of new arms to his country.Mr Zelensky himself had spent the previous day meeting EU leaders and appealing for planes to be sent - following another visit to the UK for the same purpose.Ukraine is suffering blackouts after energy facilities were targeted in six regions.Some 150,000 homes were without electricity in the eastern Kharkiv region alone, and seven people were injured, officials said. Explosions were also heard in Kyiv, although the city´s mayor said nobody was hurt. Residents sheltered in the capital´s metro system, and school lessons were reportedly held in one station.Other regions, including Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, also came under fire, and the governor of Mykolaiv region described at least three ""waves"" of missiles.Moscow has repeatedly targeted Ukraine´s energy facilities over the winter, and Ukraine´s state energy firm described Friday´s assault as the fourteenth of its kind. Such attacks have been described by some analysts as war crimes, although Russia denies intentionally harming civilians. Energy workers in the country have increasingly dangerous jobs - and 98 of them lost their lives while performing their duties last year, an official recently told Latvian media.

Ukraine war: UN condemns Russian invasion ahead of anniversary - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Latvian MP Rihards Kols swore at a Russian delegate during a European security meetingBy George WrightBBC NewsThe UN General Assembly in New York has overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago. It called for the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and a halt to fighting.The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.In Vienna, a large number of delegates walked out during a Russian address at a parliamentary session of a European security body.The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) walkout and the UN vote came a day before the first anniversary of the invasion. The UN vote called for peace as soon as possible. The resolution reaffirmed support for Ukraine´s sovereignty and territorial integrity, rejecting any Russian claims to the parts of the country it occupies. In September, MPs in Moscow voted to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine. The UN also demanded ""that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders"" and called for a cessation of hostilities. The measure is not legally binding but holds political weight.While the resolution was passed overwhelmingly by the majority of nations, there were some notable abstentions.China, India, Iran and South Africa were among the 32 countries to abstain in the vote. The seven countries who voted against were Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the vote ""made it clear that Russia must end its illegal aggression. Ukraine´s territorial integrity must be restored"".""One year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion global support for Ukraine remains strong,"" he tweeted.Has Putin´s war failed?Earlier at the OSCE in Vienna, the decision to give visas to the Russian delegation caused anger.Ukraine and Lithuania boycotted the session entirely over Austria´s decision to invite officials from Moscow, despite some being under EU sanctions. The Austrian government said it was obliged to do so under international law because the OSCE has its headquarters there. Latvian MP Rihards Kols described the Russian presence as the ""elephant in the room"", adding it was a ""disgrace"" that they were allowed to take part.A large number of delegates then staged a walkout during the Russian address.The Russian delegate, Vladimir Dzhabarov, derided delegates for walking out, repeating false claims that Russia´s invasion of Ukraine was a battle against nationalists and Nazis who Moscow claims are leading the Kyiv government. The OSCE was founded in 1975 to improve relations between the Western and Eastern blocs. Its current members include members of Nato and allies of Russia.President Vladimir Putin sent up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine on 24 February 2022 in the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two.The devastating war that ensued has left at least 7,199 civilians dead and thousands of others injured, according to a UN estimate, with the real number likely to be much higher.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: UN Chief condemns Ukraine war in special meetingRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUnited NationsUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64748349,23,02,2023,bbc,russia

Ukraine war: Migrants in Russia forced to fight in Putin's war - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, These men were drafted as part of Russia´s partial mobilisation last year - but the country is still looking for more troops for its warBy Abdujalil AbdurasulovBBC NewsRussia´s Wagner mercenary group has reportedly recruited tens of thousands of prisoners to fight in Ukraine. But the growing number of casualties and extrajudicial executions make it much harder to find volunteers, even in prisons. Many convicts are now worried that they can be simply forced to go to war - and migrant workers from Central Asian countries find themselves particularly vulnerable.Anuar came to Russia in search of work in 2018. He was later imprisoned for drug trafficking and sent to serve his term at Penal Colony Number Six in Vladimir region. The BBC is not disclosing his real name and citizenship for safety reasons.  At the end of January, he told his father that a group of Central Asians had been sent to fight in Ukraine without their consent. ""There are lots of Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kyrgyz there in that prison. Now they are planning to send another group and my son is worried that they will force him to go too,"" Anuar´s father told the BBC.   The BBC has seen court documents and Anuar´s letters which confirm he is indeed serving his sentence in that prison. And his story about the group that was forced to go to Ukraine in January is also corroborated by Olga Romanova, director of the civil rights organisation Russia Behind Bars. Parents of those prisoners approached her for help.  ""They were not given a choice. They were told to sign the contract and were sent to the front line like a bag of potatoes,"" Ms Romanova said.  Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Parents of prisoners have approached Olga Romanova for helpInitially, the parents were willing to go to court so that their children wouldn´t end up in Ukraine, she says. But then they refused to, out of fear of the punishment their children could face if they stayed in prison. Penal Colony Number Six is notorious for its ill-treatment and frequent beatings of convicts. Olga Romanova described it as ""a torture prison"". It´s where Alexei Navalny, the prominent Russian opposition figure, is being held.  The colony´s administration has not replied to the BBC´s request to respond to the allegations that they forced prisoners to sign military contracts.  Recruitment in prisons appears to have been very successful, but things are changing as the Wagner group is suffering heavy losses on the battlefield. BBC Uzbek has spoken to Farukh (not his real name), a citizen of Uzbekistan who is in prison in Russia´s Rostov region. Several of his fellow inmates joined Wagner. First it was voluntary, Farukh said, but now he´s worried that prisoners may be forced to go to war.  ""In the beginning, I also considered going because everyone thought that Russia was more powerful, that Russia would win - maybe in one month, three months or in one year. But now we see how many people are dying there and if they are short of soldiers - it´s not good. If they tell me to go and I refuse, then they can declare that I am against Russia.""  Central Asian citizens are recruited to fight for Russia in other ways too, not just in prisons. Overall, there are about 10.5 million migrants from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia, according to the latest statistics from the Russian Interior Ministry. And that´s a massive resource for military headhunters to tap.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Wagner has reportedly recruited tens of thousands of prisoners to fight in UkraineRussian authorities openly sign up people to join the armed forces at the migration centre in Moscow. There are even ads in Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik languages offering citizens of these countries a fast track to obtain a Russian passport if they join the armed forces.  But activists say that it´s not always voluntary. Migrant rights defender Valentina Chupik told the BBC that police officers sometimes stopped Central Asian migrants on the street and intimidated them into signing a military contract. They were told that otherwise they would get deported, Ms Chupik said.Many labour migrants lack proper work permits, live at a place other than where they´re registered, or violate other migration rules. And that´s why they can be an easy target for recruiters. Aziz, not his real name, who has dual Russian and Tajik citizenship, told the BBC he was detained during a police raid at the construction site where he works. He was told he´d be taken to a police station to check his ID but instead, he ended up at a military enlistment office. When he started shouting at police officers demanding why they had lied to him, they twisted his arms and threw him back into the bus.  Eventually they released him. But many migrants in Russia are too afraid of law enforcement officers to object to being signed up for the war.Related TopicsKazakhstanRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUzbekistanKyrgyzstanVladimir PutinTajikistanUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64582985,14,02,2023,bbc,russia
Russia in Africa: How disinformation operations target the continent - BBC News,"Image source, AFPImage caption, The networks promotes Russia´s Wagner mercenariesBy Grigor AtanesianGlobal Disinformation TeamA large social network that promotes anti-Western and pro-Kremlin ideas is helping Russia expand its influence at the expense of France in some of its former colonies in Africa.Called Russosphère (Russian Sphere), typical posts accuse France of modern-day ""colonialism"", eulogise Vladimir Putin, and call the Ukrainian army ""Nazis"" and ""Satanists"", echoing the official Russian line.They also heap praise on Russia´s Wagner mercenaries - even sharing recruitment information should followers want to join up.Experts say that such misinformation drives mistrust between African nations and the West, and contributes to a lack of support for Ukraine on the continent.Working with Logically, the tech organisation who traced the network, the BBC´s Global Disinformation Team tracked down the surprising figure behind it: a 65-year-old Belgian politician who calls himself a Stalinist.Defending Russia and thanking WagnerRussosphère describes itself as ""a network in defence of Russia"". Made up of several social media groups on different platforms, it was created in 2021 but fully launched in February 2022 - just days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The network swiftly gained over 80,000 followers.Image caption, A typical post on RussosphèreAfter the invasion, Russian state media was restricted or banned from all mainstream social platforms. Russosphère was not, and quickly became active on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter in addition to Telegram and VK - Russia´s homegrown version of Facebook.The discovery comes at a time of a swift deterioration in relationships between France and several African nations that analysts partly attribute to the Kremlin´s influence and a growing pro-Russian sentiment fuelled by propaganda.Kyle Walter is head of US investigations at Logically. Using data from their internal artificial intelligence-powered platform combined with open source intelligence, Logically tracked the network back to a man called Luc Michel.In the past, Mr Michel has worked to legitimise votes in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, and been linked to ""Merci [thank you] Wagner"", a group supporting the work of the Russian mercenaries.We contacted Mr Michel and he agreed to discuss Russosphère. He told us he created it, but said it received no financial support from Russia, saying it is funded by ""private money"".He also insisted that he had no connections with Wagner and its head Yevgeny Prigozhin. ""I manage the cyberwar, the media war… and Prigozhin conducts military activities,"" he said.Image source, Luc Michel´s websiteImage caption, Luc Michel is little known in Europe, but promotes himself in AfricaAccording to Mr Walter, a co-author of Logically´s report, this campaign is the first time Mr Michel´s efforts have had real-world impact. ""Russosphère is the first time Luc Michel and the general influence operations he runs have had significant success,"" he says.""Even if the groups have been helped by bots in the beginning, they are now an authentic organic influence operation, with a large portion of real followers from across Africa.""Admirer of Gaddafi and PutinMr Michel´s early history may seem unusual for a self-proclaimed friend of Africa.Born in 1958, he was politically active from a young age, first in the neo-fascist groups of his native Belgium, and later as a follower of Jean Thiriart, a former Nazi collaborator who envisioned a ""Euro-Soviet empire from Vladivostok to Dublin"", united against America.His career took him to Libya in support of the country´s leader at the time, Muammar Gaddafi. He also went to Burundi as an advisor to then-President Pierre Nkurunziza.Image caption, Mr Michel interviewing the CAR President TouadéraThroughout, he maintained a Russian connection, working with ""Nashi"", the Kremlin´s youth movement, and creating a self-styled ""election-monitoring group"" that declared Moscow´s 2014 illegal referendums in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk ""free and fair"". ""I am a Stalinist,"" he told the BBC. ""I have defended Russia since the 1980s. I think that Russia is the only force left in Europe that is anti-American. I am nostalgic of the Soviet Union. I want a free world without America.""From social media to the streetsIt is difficult to assess the impact of specific disinformation campaigns, but in Africa the pro-Russian message is being heard - amplified, say analysts, by local influencers cultivated by Russia.""The success of people like Luc Michel is because of his opposition to France. It taps into real grievances on the ground,"" says Kevin Limonier, an associate professor at the University of Paris-8 studying Moscow´s information operations in Africa.""Russian misinformation was a factor helping to drive the French forces out of Sahel countries, especially Burkina Faso,"" according to Ulf Laessing, from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a centre-right German think tank.From 2013, some 5,000 French troops had been deployed to fight militant jihadist groups in Mali as well as in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger and Mauritania. But last year, they pulled out of Mali and are preparing to leave Burkina Faso.Image source, AFPImage caption, A Russian flag at a protest in Chad in October 2022They have been under pressure from the military governments in the two countries but Beverly Ochieng from BBC Monitoring agrees that popular sentiment may have had something to do with it.""Russian flags were waved at protests in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, and that is in part due to pro-Russian info-ops,"" she says.In Burkina Faso, protesters attacked the French embassy and were heard demanding closer ties between Ouagadougou and Moscow.This chimes directly with Mr Michel´s aims. ""I think that Russia must replace the French in all of Africa,"" he told the BBC.""Estimating the impact of information operations is almost impossible,"" says Mr Limonier, expert in the Kremlin´s influence campaigns. But one thing is clear: such operations worry the West.In Paris, according to Mr Limonier, ""the diplomats and the military, they read it, they see it and they say: ´Oh my gosh´.""Related TopicsCentral African RepublicRussiaBurundiBurkina FasoPropagandaDisinformationMali",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64451376,01,02,2023,bbc,russia
Russia pilots reckless in drone collision - US - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, EPAImage caption, Reaper drones are full-size aircraft designed for reconnaissance and surveillanceBy James Landale in Kyiv and Laura Gozzi in LondonBBC NewsThe US has accused Russia of reckless behaviour after an American drone crashed into the Black Sea following an encounter with Russian fighter jets.Before the collision, Russian jets are said to have dumped fuel into the path of the drone, which the US says was in international airspace.The damaged MQ-9 Reaper drone was brought down by the US after it became ""unflyable"", the Pentagon said.Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact.The key question is whether the encounter was merely an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. US military officials said the incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.Several times before the collision, the fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a ""reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner"", it said in a statement. Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was ""unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down"", adding that the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.He said the jets were able to land following the incident.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Pentagon calls Russia´s move ´unsafe, unprofessional´Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan. Brig Gen Ryder said to his knowledge the Russians had not recovered the drone.The United States´ National Security Council´s John Kirby told CNN: ""Without getting into too much detail, what I can say is that we´ve taken steps to protect our equities with respect to that particular drone.""Russia´s defence ministry said the drone crashed after a ""sharp manoeuvre"" and that it was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.Prof Michael Clarke, visiting professor in war studies at King´s College, told the BBC the collision was ""almost certainly an accident"".The ex-director general of the defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute said: ""I don´t believe any pilot could deliberately do that [only colliding with another aircraft´s propeller] without seriously endangering their aircraft and own life.""The incident highlights the increasing risk of direct confrontation between Russia and the US over the Ukraine war.To protest against the move, the US summoned Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov in Washington.Following the meeting, Russian state media quoted Mr Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as ""a provocation"" and that ""the unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern"". RAF and German jets intercept Russian aircraft near Estonian airspaceThe US drone crash is a moment fraught with dangerOn Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters there had been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia´s annexation of Crimea in 2014.After Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year the US and the UK stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. According to the US, there has been a ""pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots"" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. This means the downing of the drone could conceivably have been the result of a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they ""buzzed"" the unmanned aircraft. But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then analysts say that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.As US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that ""could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation"".

China refuses to condemn Russia's Ukraine invasion during G20 deadlock - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersBy Oliver SlowBBC NewsFinance ministers of the world´s largest economies have failed to agree on a closing statement following a summit in India, after China refused to condemn Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.Beijing declined to accept parts of a G20 statement that deplored Russia´s aggression ""in the strongest terms"".Moscow said ""anti-Russian"" Western countries had ""destabilised"" the G20.It comes after China this week published a plan to end the conflict that was viewed by some as pro-Russian. India, which hosted this week´s G20 talks in the southern city of Bengaluru, issued a wide-ranging ""chair´s summary"" from the meeting, noting there were ""different assessments of the situation"" in Ukraine, and on sanctions imposed on Russia.A footnote said that two paragraphs summarising the war were ""agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China"". The paragraphs were adapted from the G20 Bali Leaders´ Declaration in November, and criticised ""in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine"".After taking a back seat since the invasion a year ago, Beijing has stepped up its diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in recent weeks. Its top diplomat Wang Yi toured Europe this week, culminating in a warm welcome by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.China also this week published a 12-point plan for ending the war in Ukraine, in which it called for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty. However, the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and did not condemn Russia´s invasion.The Chinese document was welcomed by Russia, prompting US President Joe Biden to comment: ""[President] Putin´s applauding it, so how could it be any good?""Zelensky wants to meet China´s Xi to discuss peace planWhy China launched a charm offensiveAfter the G20 meeting, Ajay Seth, a senior Indian official, said in a press conference that Russian and Chinese representatives did not agree to the wording on Ukraine because ""their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues"". ""On the other hand, all the other 18 countries felt that the war has got implications for the global economy"" and needed to be mentioned, he added. The 17-paragraph summary of the summit also referenced the recent earthquake in Turkey, debt in low- and middle-income countries, global tax policy, and food insecurity.Russia´s foreign ministry said it regretted the fact that ""the activities of the G20 continue to be destabilised by the Western collective and used in an anti-Russian... way"". It accused the United States, European Union and G7 nations of ""clear blackmail"", urging them to ""acknowledge the objective realities of a multipolar world"". But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: ""This is a war. And this war has a cause, has one cause, and that is Russia and Vladimir Putin. That must be expressed clearly at this G20 finance meeting."" Previous meetings of G20 members have also failed to produce a joint statement since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. On Thursday, the UN General Assembly in New York overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warChinaRussiaIndiaG20",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64773618,25,02,2023,bbc,russia

Russia orders Estonian ambassador to leave country - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Margus Laidre had been Estonia´s representative in Russia since 2018, and had previously worked in Finland and the UKBy Imogen JamesBBC News The Estonian ambassador in Russia has been ordered to leave the country by 7 February after the Kremlin accused the country of ""Russophobia"". In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said Estonia had ""purposefully destroyed"" relations with Moscow. Margus Laidre is the first ambassador Russia has expelled since invading Ukraine last year. Estonia responded by asking the Russian ambassador to leave by the same date. Russia´s move against Mr Laidre comes after Estonia recently ordered a reduction in the size of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn.Moscow was told to reduce its embassy from 17 to eight by the end of January. In a statement in January, Estonia said embassy staff had stopped seeking to advance relations between the countries since the conflict broke out. Tensions were also raised last week after representatives from 11 Nato nations gathered at an army base in Estonia to discuss a range of new packages to help Ukraine recapture territory and fend off any further Russian advances. Latvia´s foreign ministry has also asked the Russian ambassador to leave by 24 February and said the country would support Estonia by reducing diplomatic relations with Russia.Mr Laidre has been appointed to the Russian Federation since 2018 and has previously held the role in the UK and Finland. He was working from the Estonian Embassy in Moscow, and will now be replaced with a chargé d´affaires - a diplomat of a lower rank acting in place of an ambassador. The statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: ""In recent years, the Estonian leadership has purposefully destroyed the entire range of relations with Russia. Total Russophobia, the cultivation of hostility towards our country has been elevated by Tallinn to the rank of state policy.""Now Estonia has taken a new unfriendly step to radically reduce the number of personnel of the Russian embassy in Tallinn, confirming the line towards the collapse of relations between our countries. As a response, the Russian side decided to downgrade the diplomatic representative in both countries to chargé d´affaires.""The press release added that Mr Laidre was summoned to the ministry on Monday where he was asked to leave the country. The statement ended by stating that the development of the two countries´ relationship now lies with Estonia.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaEstonia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64372508,23,01,2023,bbc,russia
US charges ex-FBI agent with violating Russia sanctions - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The former FBI agent pleaded not guilty in court on MondayBy Bernd Debusmann JrBBC News, WashingtonA former top FBI official is facing criminal charges for allegedly trying to help a Russian oligarch get off a US sanctions list, prosecutors say.Charles McGonigal was arrested alongside an ex-Russian diplomat on Saturday. The pair face money laundering and conspiracy charges. Mr McGonigal also faces charges he took $225,000 (£181,612) in cash from a foreign agent while still in the FBI. He is one of the highest-ranking FBI agents to ever be charged with a crime. Mr McGonigal was arrested on Saturday after returning to JFK International Airport in New York from international travel, and on Monday entered a plea of not guilty at a federal courthouse in Manhattan.According to federal prosecutors, the 54-year-old Mr McGonigal  - who was in charge of FBI counterintelligence in New York before his retirement in 2018 - and former Russian diplomat Sergey Shestakov violated US sanctions by agreeing to provide services to Russian billionaire and industrialist Oleg Deripaska. Mr Deripaska, 55, is reportedly once Russia´s richest man and was president of energy company En+ Group and United Company Rusal - the world´s second largest aluminium company - before leaving both firms in 2018. He was hit with sanctions the same year, with the US accusing him and a handful of other Russian oligarchs and officials of ""malign activity around the globe"".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Charles McGonigal stands accused of working on behalf of oligarch Oleg Deripaska, seen here.US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Monday that Mr McGonigal and Mr Shestakov ""both previously worked with Deripaska to attempt to have his sanctions removed"". ""As public servants, they should have known better.""Prosecutors believe the two men agreed to investigate a rival oligarch and have Mr Deripaska removed from a list of individuals sanctioned by the US.The men and an associate of Mr Deripaska are accusing of ""using shell companies as counterparties in the contract that outlined the services to be performed, using a forged signature on that contract, and using the same shell companies to send and receive payments from Deripaska"", prosecutors allege. Mr McGonigal faces separate charges that he took cash while still serving in the FBI ""from an individual who had business interests in Europe and who had been an employee of a foreign intelligence service"".Prosecutors did not name the individual but describe the person as a former ""foreign security officer and businessperson"" with interests abroad. Mr McGonigal and Mr Shestakovnow face four sanctions-related and money laundering charges, each of which carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. Mr Shestakov also faces charges that he made false statements, punishable by another five years. In the separate charges, Mr McGonigal faces six counts of false statements - each punishable by five years - as well as two counts of falsification of records and documents, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years.

Ukraine war: Life in Mariupol under Russian occupation - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, The invading Russian forces damaged some 90% of residential buildings in MariupolBy Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC MonitoringFinding people willing to speak to me from Mariupol was never going to be easy. After 10 months of Russian occupation, fear and distrust are the two most frequent responses I encountered when looking for someone who could tell me how things really are in Mariupol, in Ukraine´s south-east.""I think you are a Russian journalist. You won´t like what I´ve got to say. People like you kill if you tell them the truth,"" said one social media user who claimed to be from the port city.Russian forces put the people of Mariupol through a horrific months-long siege, before finally capturing it last May.I eventually found three residents willing to speak to me at length: a local city councillor, a retired pensioner and an engineer. All spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from the local authorities installed by Russia (who block access to occupied Ukraine by Western journalists).They paint a picture of a massively expensive campaign conducted by Russia to win over the hearts and minds of the people of Mariupol, and rebuild a city damaged beyond recognition by Russia´s own troops.The purpose of this campaign is to assimilate Mariupol and make it Russia´s own.Their accounts corroborate each other, and are confirmed by social media posts about recent developments in Mariupol.Before this war began about half a million people lived in the city.According to UN estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed, and 350,000 people were forced to leave after Russia attacked in February 2022.

It is difficult to estimate the exact number of people killed as a result of the relentless shelling of Mariupol, but Ukrainian authorities say more than 20,000 died there. Russian-installed authorities in Mariupol say some 300,000 people are now living there.The people who spoke to me from Mariupol said their city had been inundated with labourers from across Russia, as well as from Central Asia. Oleg Morgun, the Russia-installed ""mayor"" of Mariupol, says some 70,000 of those currently in the city are construction workers and members of the Russian military.Rebuilding New buildings have appeared and many buildings damaged during the bombardment have gone.For example, the Russian military has built a whole new district comprised of a dozen apartment blocks in the western part of Mariupol. It is called Nevsky, after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin´s home city of St Petersburg stands. According to Russian state media, St Petersburg is the main sponsor of the reconstruction of Mariupol.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Russia is building new housing to replace what it destroyed""It says on the bus: St Petersburg and Mariupol are twinned cities. There are slogans everywhere telling us that we´re part of Russia now,"" pensioner Maria (not her real name) told me.""I liked things the way they used to be. Now we live in fear. We have no idea what to expect.""In the houses that escaped relatively unscathed after months of fierce fighting, the Russians are replacing windows, radiators and sometimes heating and sewage pipes.Heating, running water and electricity supplies have largely been restored. Buses are running and full of passengers again, although the electric trolley bus and tram networks are still out of action.Many schools, hospitals and shops have reopened as well, although numerous traders are selling their wares straight from the pavement.Maria was particularly impressed with one school rebuilt under Russian rule: ""It´s so beautiful, covered in multi-coloured squares."" According to her, the number of children in Mariupol now is greater than schools can currently accommodate, so they have classes in two shifts: one in the morning, and another in the afternoon.Russia has imposed its own Russian-language curriculum in occupied areas - complicating efforts to get children back to school.  Image source, ReutersImage caption, Shops have reopened and power is back, but many traders are selling their wares on the pavementThe fast-paced rebuilding of Mariupol has provoked envy in Donetsk, the regional capital occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014, which has been neglected by comparison.The Russia-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People´s Republic, Denis Pushilin, has even had to deny rumours that the capital will be moved to Mariupol.AssimilationThere are other important ways in which Russia is putting its stamp on Mariupol.For example, local residents are under pressure to obtain Russian passports.Ivan, the Mariupol city councillor I spoke to (not his real name), said locals often formed ""huge queues"" trying to get Russian passports.They were required if you want to find formal employment, especially with government agencies or in the public sector, he explained.Also, they made it possible to travel to Russia without additional stringent checks known as ""filtration"", he added.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Ukraine believes 20,000 people died during the siege of Mariupol""So they have deliberately created a situation where you get problems if you have Ukrainian papers, you have to deal with red tape, you have to wait. On the other hand, if you get a Russian passport, that´s where your problems end: ´You´re one of us now´. Things get simpler if you receive a Russian passport,"" Ivan said.Mariupol is also becoming part of Russia´s financial system. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya, has been phased out, and now the Russian rouble is the only currency accepted in shops.Russia is channelling huge amounts of money into pension payments for residents of Mariupol, raising them in many cases compared with what they received from the Ukrainian authorities before the war. So residents of Mariupol are able to draw two pensions - one from Russia, another from Ukraine. Naturally, it is a situation many local pensioners are happy with.Russian pensions are another reason why elderly residents are queuing up to get Russian passports - many pensioners believe the documents will be required in the future to continue receiving payments from Russia.The media currently operating in Mariupol are also hard at work promoting a uniformly pro-Russian agenda.Pro-Russian sentimentMany current residents of Mariupol are there because they were unable to leave the city when the Russians attacked, due to illness or old age, or because they welcome Russia´s presence.""We´ve suffered enough under Ukraine. Now we can breathe again,"" one social media user told me, before breaking off all contact.Image source, ReutersImage caption, New signs for the city are decked out in the colours of the Russian flagThe fast-paced campaign of reconstruction and the resulting sense of restored normality, the generous pension payments and the intensive media campaign targeting the people of Mariupol, all stimulate the spread of pro-Russian sentiment in the city.""I´m sick of all the propaganda in the papers. They started publishing it from day one, telling us how well things are going,"" said Yuri, the engineer (not his real name). ""I feel out of place in my own city now. People are different, my city feels different now."" City councillor Ivan said: ""It´s become difficult for me to say pro-Ukrainian things to my voters. It´s tough being pro-Ukrainian in a pro-Russian environment. Unfortunately, Ukraine is losing the hearts and minds of people in Mariupol.""Those who are still in Mariupol may be happy to see a degree of normality return to their city, but there are those who suspect Russia of pursuing ulterior motives.Popular Ukrainian journalist Denys Kazansky argues that Russia uses the new houses it has been building in Mariupol to distract attention from all the destruction it caused in the city and elsewhere in his native Donetsk region.""If they destroyed 10 hospitals and then rebuilt one - this isn´t reconstruction. It´s not something they can be thanked for,"" he said.""You can be happy as much as you like about a school being rebuilt, but what do you do with the thousands of people Russia has killed?"" he said. ""You can´t rebuild them. You can´t bring them back.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64887890,13,03,2023,bbc,russia
Soledar: Russia claims victory in battle for Ukraine salt mine town - BBC News,"Image source, Maxar TechnologiesImage caption, Soledar has been devastated by Russia´s bombardment, as shown by this satellite image from TuesdayBy Will Vernon in Moscow & Paul Kirby in LondonBBC NewsRussia´s military says it has captured the Ukrainian salt-mine town of Soledar after a long battle, calling it an ""important"" step for its offensive.The victory would allow Russian troops to push on to the nearby city of Bakhmut, and cut off the Ukrainian forces there, a spokesman said.This was a very confident and ambitious statement from Moscow.But Ukrainian officials said the fight for Soledar was still going on and accused Russia of ""information noise"".The battle for Soledar has been one of the bloodiest of the war. The town is relatively small, with a pre-war population of just 10,000, and its strategic significance is debatable. But if it is confirmed that Russian forces have seized control of it, then there will likely be a big sigh of relief in the Kremlin.Divisions have emerged between regular Russian forces and the notorious Russian Wagner paramilitary group throughout the battle, with a jealous turf-war developing over who should take credit for the advance. Barely any walls in Soledar remain standing, Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week. Describing almost apocalyptic scenes, he spoke of the nearby terrain as scarred by missile strikes and littered with Russian corpses.Speaking during his nightly address from Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky said the battle in the region continued to rage, but avoided any reference to Russia´s claims of control over Soledar. ""Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our troops - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defence and security forces - are defending the state,"" the Ukrainian leader said. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, compared the fight for Soledar and Bakhmut to one of the bitterest battles of World War One, at Verdun.Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Thursday that 559 civilians including 15 children remained in Soledar and could not be moved out. Satellite images show Soledar devastationWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group in Ukraine?Russia-supporting Wagner Group mercenary numbers soarThe town´s significance for the Russian military is disputed by military analysts because of its relatively small size. The US-based think tank Institute for the Study of War said while it was likely that Russian forces had captured Soledar, it did not believe they would then be able to go on to encircle Bakhmut.Nevertheless, if it becomes clear that Russia has taken it, then that will be seen in Moscow as progress - even a victory. That is exactly what President Vladimir Putin needs as Russia has failed to capture a single town in Ukraine since July 2022. Since then, Moscow´s forces have suffered a whole series of embarrassing defeats. Ukraine´s successful counter-attack pushed Russia almost completely out of Kharkiv region in the north-east. In October, Russia´s Kerch bridge came under attack, with Russian forces retreating from the city of Kherson the following month. The southern port city had been the only regional capital that Russia had managed to seize since the invasion began. Capturing Soledar would be something for Moscow to present as some ""good news"" to the Russian people and the troops on the wintry front line.But Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine´s eastern military command, denied Soledar was in Russian hands: ""We won´t give any more details as we do not want to reveal the tactical positions of our fighters.""Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Malyar, said fighting had been ""hot in Soledar overnight"". Ukrainian fighters were ""bravely trying to hold the defence"", she added, in what was a difficult stage of the war.Western and Ukrainian officials have said much of the fighting in Soledar and Bakhmut is being done by the notoriously brutal Wagner mercenary group. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Ukraine this week cast doubt on a photo claiming to show Yevgeny Prigozhin inside a Soledar salt mineIts leader, 61-year-old Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed repeatedly over the past few days that his forces are the only units on the ground in Soledar. He said on Tuesday night that his mercenaries had seized the town, only to be contradicted by Russia´s defence ministry the next morning. Daily updates from the Russian defence ministry have made no mention whatsoever of Wagner, and Friday´s briefing was no exception. The military said that paratroopers had played a key part in the capture of the town. Mr Prigozhin then released a statement saying he was ""surprised"" to read the defence ministry briefing. There ""wasn´t a single paratrooper"" in Soledar, he insisted, warning against ""insulting [his] fighters"" and ""stealing others´ achievements"".And on Friday evening, Mr Prigozhin accused ""officials who want to stay in their places"" of being the biggest threat to his group´s advance in Ukraine. In a later statement, the defence ministry praised the mercenaries´ ""courageous and selfless actions"" during the fighting, but again emphasised the leading role of regular Russian forces. Analysts have long spoken of tensions between the military and Mr Prigozhin´s Wagner group. The Russian oligarch has publicly criticised senior military leaders, including Gen Valery Gerasimov, appointed two days ago as overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. While Russia has mobilised some 300,000 reservists for the war since the end of September, Prigozhin has looked to recruit extra numbers from Russia´s prisons. Andriy Yermak told French daily Le Monde that Russian criminals had been sent straight to their deaths on the front line: ""Soledar is a scene of street battles, with neither side really in control of the town.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64263119,13,01,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine conflict: What war crimes is Russia accused of? - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersThe International Criminal Court in the Hague has issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin.It accuses him of being responsible for war crimes in Ukraine, including the unlawful deportation of children.Russia´s Commissioner for Children´s Rights, Ms Maria Lvova-Belova, is also subject to an arrest warrant.According to Ukraine, tens of thousands of possible war crimes have been carried out by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine in February last year.What is a war crime?""Even war has rules"", as the International Committee of the Red Cross says. These are set out in treaties called the Geneva Conventions along with other international laws and agreements. Military forces cannot deliberately attack civilians - nor the infrastructure that is vital to their survival. Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines, and chemical or biological weapons. The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers, who have rights as prisoners of war. Serious offences such as murder, rape or mass persecution of a group are known as ""crimes against humanity"" or in some circumstances ""genocide"".What are the latest allegations against President Putin?The United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has said there is evidence of the illegal transfer of hundreds of Ukrainian children to Russia.Russia has introduced policies such as forcing children to take Russian citizenship and placing them in foster families to ""create a framework in which some of the children may end up remaining permanently"" in Russia, the commission´s report notes.While the transfers were supposed to be temporary, ""most became prolonged"", with both parents and children facing ""an array of obstacles in establishing contact"", the UN investigators wrote.Ukraine government figures put the number of children forcibly taken to Russia at 16,221.These forced deportations ""violate international humanitarian law and amount to a war crime"", concludes the UN report.What other war crimes is Russia said to have carried out in Ukraine?The UN said that in addition to the rapes, killings and ""widespread"" torture, Moscow could be responsible for the even more serious ""crimes against humanity"" - notably the wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine´s energy infrastructure that began last October.Mass burial sites have been found in several parts of Ukraine previously occupied by Russian troops, including some holding civilian bodies showing signs of torture. In April 2022, more than 400 bodies of civilians were found in Bucha, a town on the outskirts of KyivIn September 2022, 450 bodies - mostly of civilians - were found in mass graves in Izium, in Kharkiv regionPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russian troops could have committed more than 400 war crimes in the Kherson region while it was under their occupation from March to November 2022In March 2022, Russian forces carried out an air strike on a theatre in Mariupol which was being used as a refuge for childrenA hospital in Mariupol was also struck in March last yearImage source, ReutersImage caption, Mariupol theatre after the air strikeHow can war crimes be prosecuted?Ukraine´s courts have already prosecuted one Russian soldier. 21-year-old Russian tank commander Vadim Shishimarin was jailed for life for shooting an unarmed civilian, 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka, a few days after the invasion began. It may prove easier, however, to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes than military commanders or senior politicians.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Vadim Shishimarin was the first Russian soldier to be tried for war crimesHugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch says establishing the ""chain of command"" is very important for any future trials, including whether a leader authorised an atrocity - or turned a blind eye to it. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine - going back as far as 2013, before Russia´s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Its chief prosecutor, British lawyer Karim Khan, believes there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out. However, the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects, and Russia is not a signatory to the agreement which set up the court - so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.The ICC generally takes over prosecutions for war crimes in countries where the court systems are too weak to carry out the prosecutions themselves.So far, however, it seems Ukraine´s courts have been able to mount their own cases. By the end of August, its prosecutor general had charged 135 suspected war criminals.Image source, Getty ImagesThe ICC can bring a prosecution against political leaders for ""waging aggressive war"". This covers an unjustified invasion or conflict not undertaken in self-defence. However, Professor Philippe Sands, an expert on international law at University College London, says the ICC couldn´t prosecute Russian leaders such as President Vladimir Putin for this - again, because the country isn´t a signatory to the court. In theory, the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But Russia could veto this. Prof Sands says world leaders should set up a one-off tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression in Ukraine.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaInternational Criminal CourtInternational Court of JusticeVladimir PutinUkraineTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished4 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished1 hour agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished55 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Moscow Helsinki Group: Russia's oldest human rights organisation told to close - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Moscow Helsinki Group says it will challenge the court´s decision to close it downBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsA court in Russia has ordered the country´s oldest human rights organisation to be closed down.The Moscow Helsinki Group (MHG) was founded in 1976 and reports annually on the human rights situation in Russia.However, the authorities have now said it does not have the correct registration. It is the latest in a series of closures targeting rights and opposition groups across Russia. The ruling comes after the justice ministry filed a lawsuit seeking to liquidate the group in December, arguing that it was only registered to defend human rights in Moscow - not other parts of the country.That´s despite the MHG having always worked with a wider scope.The group called the measure ""disproportionate"" at the time and said it would continue to function ""regardless of the wishes of the authorities"". In a statement on Wednesday, MHG reported that its co-chair told the judge and justice ministry representatives that they were ""committing a great sin"" by closing it down. ""You are destroying the human rights movement, you are destroying it,"" said Valery Borshov. ""The liquidation of the group is a serious blow to the human rights movement not only in Russia but also the world.""The lawsuit was based on the justice ministry´s ad hoc inspections of the MHG, which the group argued were illegal. It has said it will appeal the decision.It´s not the first time MHG has been forced to cease its operations. It lasted only months after its launch in the 1970s before the government jailed or forced practically all its members into exile. It was set up by a group of well known Soviet dissidents and named after the Helsinki accords, a wide-ranging international agreement signed by the USSR, which defended human rights and fundamental freedoms. The group was revived in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. MHG has likened its treatment by the Russian authorities to that suffered by Memorial, another prominent human rights group, which was shut down in 2021.Last year, Moscow courts liquidated several other rights groups, including the Journalists and Media Workers´ Union.International human rights organisations have heavily criticised the Russian government for what they claim is a nationwide crackdown on independent journalism and dissenting voices that has intensified since its invasion of Ukraine. That includes top opposition figures, the majority of whom are now either in prison or exiled. US-based charity the Human Rights Foundation has condemned Russia´s decision to shut down MHG. ""This is yet another example of the Kremlin´s campaign to silence opposition against the war in Ukraine,"" it tweeted.The Vice President of the European Commission, the European Union´s executive arm, has echoed these sentiments.  ""The Kremlin is extending its aggression in Ukraine into political repression at home, silencing human rights defenders, suppressing civil society and voices rejecting authoritarianism and war,"" said Josep Borrell on Twitter.

"Ukraine war: Russia must be defeated but not crushed, Macron says - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, EPAImage caption, In a speech to world leaders, Emmanuel Macron did not shy away from mentioning Russia-Ukraine peace talks as a final goalBy Phelan Chatterjee & Matt MurphyBBC NewsFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said he does not want to see Russia crushed by a defeat in Ukraine. Speaking to French media, Mr Macron urged Western nations to increase military support for Kyiv and said he was prepared for a protracted war.""I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,"" he said.But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to ""crush"" the nation.The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.""I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,"" Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche.""Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position."" Addressing the conference in Munich on Friday, Mr Macron insisted that now was not the time for dialogue with Moscow.But he did not shy away from mentioning peace talks as a final goal.The president suggested that Ukrainian military efforts, supported by allies, were the only way to ""bring Russia back to the table and build a lasting peace"".He also dismissed the prospect of regime change in Russia, describing similar efforts around the world as a ""total failure"".Despite Mr Macron´s comments, negotiations are a faraway prospect for Ukraine´s leaders.On Friday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision to not invite Moscow to the Munich conference.Russian leaders should not be invited to the table as long as the ""terrorist state kills, as long as it uses bombs, missiles and tanks as an argument for international politics"", he said.President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out immediate talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, insisting there was ""no trust"" between the parties. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, he also dismissed the idea of giving up territory to strike a peace deal with Moscow.Mr Macron has previously been criticised by some Nato allies for sending what they believe are mixed messages on Ukraine.Last June, he was condemned by Mr Kuleba for saying it was vital that Russia was not ""humiliated over its invasion"".Mr Kuleba at the time responded that Russia - which was ""humiliating itself"" - needed to be put in its place.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warFranceVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaEmmanuel MacronVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64693691,19,02,2023,bbc,russia
"Ukraine war: Big mistake for Russia to suspend nuclear arms treaty, Biden says - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, KANCELARIA PREZYDENTA RPImage caption, Mr Biden met leaders from the Bucharest Nine nations during his visit to PolandUS President Joe Biden has called Russia´s decision to suspend the New Start nuclear arms treaty a big mistake. President Vladimir Putin announced the move on Tuesday in his annual address to the nation.The deal, signed in 2010, limits the number of US and Russian nuclear warheads and gives each the power to inspect the other´s weapons. Mr Biden´s comments came as he met a key group of Nato allies in Poland. The group of eastern European states, known as the Bucharest Nine, reiterated their condemnation of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine nearly a year since its start. Putin´s decision to suspend involvement in the nuclear treaty was officially pushed through by both houses of Russia´s parliament on Wednesday.But Russia´s foreign ministry later said Moscow would continue to comply with the New Start treaty´s restrictions in a ""responsible approach"".A senior military official told Russia´s lower house that the country would continue to observe agreed restrictions on nuclear delivery systems - meaning missiles and strategic bomber planes.What is the New Start treaty?Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.Each side´s limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world´s nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.Speaking ahead of the meeting with leaders from the Bucharest Nine nations - which make up Nato´s eastern flank - Mr Biden said suspending New Start was a ""big mistake"" and reiterated the US commitment to the military alliance.""Article 5 is a sacred commitment the United States has made. We will defend literally every inch of Nato,"" he said. Article 5 stipulates that an attack on any member state is treated as an attack on all and requires a joint response.At the meeting he told the assembled leaders that they were the ""front line of our collective defence"". In a joint statement after the meeting the group said they were committed to increasing Nato´s military presence on their territories.Russia says Nato - which could soon see Sweden and Finland become new members - represents an existential threat.Mr Putin, speaking at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of the war, said Russia was fighting in Ukraine for its ""historical"" lands.""I just heard from the top military leadership of the country that a battle is ongoing right now, for our historical lands, for our people,"" he said.Earlier he met China´s top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow and said cooperation with Beijing was ""very important to stabilise the international situation"".

"Ukraine war: Russia planning 24 February offensive, Ukrainian defence minister says - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesBy Matt MurphyBBC NewsUkraine´s defence minister has said Russia is preparing a major new offensive, and warned that it could begin as soon as 24 February.Oleksii Reznikov said Moscow had amassed thousands of troops and could ""try something"" to mark the anniversary of the initial invasion last year. The attack would also mark Russia´s Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February, which celebrates the army. Meanwhile, three people have died in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk.Eight others were wounded in the city in Donetsk region after a Russian missile struck a residential building, the provincial governor said. The toll is expected to rise as rescuers comb through the wreckage.""The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,"" Mr Zelensky wrote on social media about the attack. ""By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.""Ukraine has recently renewed calls for fighter jets to help protect itself from air attacks after Germany, the US and the UK agreed to send them tanks. Image source, AFPImage caption, At least three people are thought to have been killed in a Russian rocket attack on the eastern city of KramatorskMr Reznikov said Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the potential offensive.In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a general mobilisation of some 300,000 conscripted troops, which he said was necessary to ensure the country´s ""territorial integrity"". But Mr Reznikov suggested that the true figure recruited and deployed to Ukraine could be far higher. ""Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,"" he told the French BFM network. The BBC cannot independently verify this figure. Russia has claimed recent gains in the eastern Donbas region and its forces say they are moving in on the front-line town of Bakhmut after a battle that has lasted months and led to heavy loss of life on both sides.Last month, Russian mercenaries and regular soldiers seized the nearby town of Soledar and on Wednesday a Russian-appointed official, Yan Gagin, said Bakhmut was ""operationally surrounded"".The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to ""undertake a decisive action"" and launch a ""big offensive"" in the east. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine´s commanders would seek to ""stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive"" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance. ""I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,"" he said, adding that Ukraine´s forces ""cannot lose the initiative"" they have achieved in recent months. The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would ""significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types"". Mr Reznikov´s comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring. But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine.""That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul.""Meanwhile, Ukraine´s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut. She added that Moscow´s troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October. ""Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,"" she said. Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces. ""There is a certain increase in the occupiers´ offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. ""The situation is becoming even more severe.""While the Wagner group has claimed it has been heavily involved in Russia´s recent advances in the east, a former commander who fled to Norway has told Reuters that he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for the group. Andrei Medvedev made an unverified claim that in the four months he was with Wagner, he saw two people who didn´t want to fight being shot. About 80% of Wagner´s personnel in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64492938,02,02,2023,bbc,russia
US drone crashes after encounter with Russian jet - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Reaper drones are full-size aircraft designed for reconnaissance and surveillanceBy James Landale & Henri Astierin Kyiv and LondonA Russian fighter jet has collided with a US drone, causing the unmanned US aircraft to crash into the Black Sea, the American military says.The incident highlights the increasing risk of direct confrontation between Russia and the US over the Ukraine war.The US says the drone was on a routine mission in international airspace when two Russian jets tried to intercept it.Russia said the drone crashed after a ""sharp manoeuvre"", and denied that the two aircraft made direct contact. The Russian defence ministry also said the MQ-9 Reaper drone was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan. Drone crash is a moment fraught with dangerThe incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday, according to the US military.

Several times before the collision the Su-27 fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a ""reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner"", it said. The US summoned the Russian ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, to protest against the move.Following the meeting, Russian state media quoted Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as ""a provocation"".Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia´s annexation of Crimea in 2014.Since Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. The key question is whether Tuesday´s encounter was an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work, or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. According to the US, there has been a ""pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots"" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. So this could simply have been a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they ""buzzed"" the drone. But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: What is a MQ-9 Reaper drone?Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that.

Emmanuel Macron's mission to counter Russia in Africa - BBC News,"Image source, AFPImage caption, French President Emmanuel Macron (L) met Gabon´s President Ali Bongo (R) in Libreville on ThursdayBy Paul MellyAfrica Programme, Chatham House, LondonLibreville, Luanda, Brazzaville, Kinshasa - France´s President Emmanuel Macron is on a whirlwind tour of African capitals as he tries to shift French policy on the continent away from military involvement.He can hardly be accused of ignoring Africa - this is his 18th presidential trip - but this comes at a time of ever-increasing competition from China and Russia, and growing resentment of the close economic ties between France and its former colonial, which some see as a form of continued exploitation.And he insists that he will come back, again and again, to a continent that he regards as a crucial partner for Europe in tackling major global issues over the decades ahead.Although Ukraine inevitably dominates the international diplomatic agenda, Mr Macron believes that Paris and Brussels cannot afford to neglect Africa. It presents challenges and huge development opportunities, with a youthful dynamism that, he argues, will be a huge contributor to Europe´s own future growth.France´s president is also acutely aware of how other nations are seeking to extend their own influence south of the Sahara.Russia, hoping to rebuild the influence it had lost since the Cold War decades, is offering security support to governments that feel under threat or isolated from the international mainstream: mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked military contractor Wagner are now operating in Mali and the Central African Republic, where they have been accused of human rights abuses.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Protesters waved a Russian flag outside the French embassy in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, ahead of the president´s visitChina is a massive funder and builder of infrastructure, albeit on terms that Mr Macron fears could trap some countries in debt crisis. Turkey and India are increasingly active too.And across the region, popular anti-French sentiment is fanned by lively social media messaging to which Paris has so far found no effective response.Love Putin, Hate France: How info ops target AfricaIn a lengthy speech on Monday evening, to prepare the ground for his latest tour, the president reasserted his own strategy to sustain a role for France in this increasingly competitive arena. It was a message addressed both to Africans and to his own domestic audience.He does not think the French should try to match the Russian security effort by re-expanding its own military presence to match what Moscow offers.In any case, that would hardly be an option when Paris has been forced to pull its troops out of Mali and Burkina Faso, where the military juntas now in charge are seeking to distance themselves from the former colonial power in both countries.Instead, he aims to re-orient French support to focus more on training and technical back-up for African armed forces, with troop numbers reduced and programmes of military collaboration tailored to the specific requests of individual countries.Image source, AFPImage caption, Some 5,500 French troops were deployed at the height of the jihadist insurgency in MaliAnd this week Mr Macron took that policy a step further, announcing that the remaining French bases in Africa - in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Gabon - would now be co-managed and shared with the forces of the host nations, and even available to welcome other external partners if those governments wished. Only the base in Djibouti, strategically located at the mouth of the Red Sea will remain exclusively French.He pointed out that the base in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is well positioned for training troops from the various West African states now collaborating in efforts to prevent jihadist groups in the Sahel from pushing south towards the coast.But he is also anxious to pursue the diversification of French engagement across a much broader canvas, touching culture, history, immigration, trade, development and even reform of the CFA franc - a currency used by 14 countries and pegged to the euro under a guarantee provided by Paris. There is growing opposition to the use of this currency, which some see as a form of neo-colonialism, although its supporters says it helps ensure financial stability.Mr Macron first launched this approach in a high-profile Africa speech back in November 2017, in front of an audience of students in a lecture theatre at Ouagadougou University in Burkina Faso.And he has pursued it over the past five years, in an effort to transform perceptions from both sides. Previous governments in Paris, particularly in the 1990s, had already sought to move away from the old network of mutually complacent vested special connections between African and French elites encapsulated in the term ""Françafrique"", shifting instead towards stronger support for democracy and grassroots development.Image source, AFPImage caption, President Macron was in Angola´s capital on Friday meeting President João LourençoHowever, Mr Macron has gone further in confronting the painful and sometimes shameful episodes of the past, commissioning historians to produce reports unsparing in their examination of France´s track record in the war over Algerian independence and the events surrounding the Rwandan genocide of 1994.A programme of returning treasures looted during the colonial era has already seen the return home of a totemic Senegalese sword and part of a Malagasy royal throne, while artefacts looted from the kingdom of Dahomey have been sent back to Benin and arrangements have been made for the return of an iconic Ivorian drum.In parallel with this effort at reconciliation over past history, Mr Macron has been seeking to deepen today´s cultural connections and exchange of ideas. He has announced schemes to promote sports training and to ease access to visas for Africans to pursue post-graduate study in France. However, the public impact of these initiatives, particularly in the eyes of African public opinion, has been largely lost during years when the most prominent dimension of French engagement has been the military struggle against militant groups in the Sahel.France calls time on anti-jihadist Sahel operationGrowing controversy came to surround the operations of the French force Barkhane, finally withdrawn from Mali in August last year. This has fuelled an upsurge in populist nationalism in some countries and a more generalised resentment of France across most of Francophone West and Central Africa, particularly among urban youth.Having instigated a shift towards a lower profile and more collaborative military approach, Mr Macron is trying to use this week´s four-country tour to reinvigorate this broader reform and change agenda.But even this trip will be beset by familiar political complications. There have been anti-French demonstrations in the Democratic Republic of Congo ahead of his visit. Furthermore opponents of Gabon´s President Ali Bongo Ondimba and DR Congo´s President Félix Tshisekedi have been complaining that Mr Macron´s visit could be read as interference to bolster the image of these incumbent rulers in what is an election year for both countries.Related TopicsFranceEmmanuel MacronMaliDemocratic Republic of Congo",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64822485,04,03,2023,bbc,russia
How Putin's fate is tied to Russia's war in Ukraine - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Russian governmentImage caption, Vladimir Putin has been at Russia´s helm for more than 20 yearsBy Steve RosenbergRussia Editor, MoscowI keep thinking back to something I heard on Russian state TV three years ago.At the time Russians were being urged to support changes to the constitution that would enable Vladimir Putin to stay in power for another 16 years.To persuade the public, the news anchor portrayed President Putin as a sea captain steering the good ship Russia through stormy waters of global unrest.""Russia is an oasis of stability, a safe harbour,"" he continued. ""If it wasn´t for Putin what would have become of us?""So much for an oasis of stability and safe harbour. On 24 February 2022, the Kremlin captain set sail in a storm of his own making. And headed straight for the iceberg. Vladimir Putin´s invasion of Ukraine has brought death and destruction to Russia´s neighbour. It has resulted in huge military casualties for his own country: some estimates put the number of dead Russian soldiers in the tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens have been drafted into the army and Russian prisoners (including convicted killers) have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the war has impacted energy and food prices around the world and continues to threaten European and global security. All problems of Titanic proportions.So why did Russia´s president set a course for war and territorial conquest? Image source, EPAImage caption, Mr Putin attended a military ceremony on Thursday to mark Defender of the Fatherland Day""On the horizon were the Russian presidential elections of 2024,"" points out political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. ""Two years before that vote [the Kremlin] wanted some victorious event. In 2022 they would achieve their objectives. In 2023 they would instil in the minds of Russians how fortunate they were to have such a captain steering the ship, not just through troubled waters, but bringing them to new and richer shores. Then in 2024 people would vote. Bingo. What could go wrong?"" Plenty, if your plans are based on misassumptions and miscalculations. The Kremlin had expected its ""special military operation"" to be lightning fast. Within weeks, it thought, Ukraine would be back in Russia´s orbit. President Putin had seriously underestimated Ukraine´s capacity to resist and fight back, as well as the determination of Western nations to support Kyiv.Russia´s leader has yet to acknowledge, though, that he made a mistake by invading Ukraine. Mr Putin´s way is to push on, to escalate, to raise the stakes.Which brings me on to two key questions: how does Vladimir Putin view the situation one year on and what will be his next move in Ukraine?This week he gave us some clues. His state-of-the-nation address was packed with anti-Western bile. He continues to blame America and Nato for the war in Ukraine, and to portray Russia as an innocent party. His decision to suspend participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America, New Start, shows that President Putin has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or ending his standoff with the West.The following day, at a Moscow football stadium, Mr Putin shared the stage with Russian soldiers back from the front line. At what was a highly choreographed pro-Kremlin rally, President Putin told the crowd that ""there are battles going on right now on [Russia´s] historical frontiers"" and praised Russia´s ""courageous warriors"".  Conclusion: don´t expect any Kremlin U-turns. This Russian president is not for turning.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds""If he faces no resistance, he will go as far as can,"" believes Andrei Illarionov, President Putin´s former economic adviser. ""There is no other way to stop him other than military resistance.""But what about talks over tanks? Is negotiating peace with Mr Putin possible?  ""It´s possible to sit down with anyone,"" Andrei Illarionov continues, ""but we have an historic record of sitting down with Putin and making agreements with him. ""Putin violated all the documents. The agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, the treaty on the internationally recognised border of Russia and Ukraine, the UN charter, the Helsinki Act of 1975, the Budapest Memorandum. And so on. There is no document he would not violate.""When it comes to breaking agreements, the Russian authorities have a long list of their own grudges to level at the West. Topping that list is Moscow´s assertion that the West broke a promise it made in the 1990s not to enlarge the Nato alliance eastwards. And yet in his early years in office, Vladimir Putin appeared not to view Nato as a threat. In 2000 he even did not exclude Russia one day becoming a member of the Alliance. Two years later, asked to comment on Ukraine´s stated intention of joining Nato, President Putin replied: ""Ukraine is a sovereign state and is entitled to choose itself how to ensure its own security…""  He insisted the issue would not cloud relations between Moscow and Kyiv.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, On Tuesday the Russian president delivered his annual state-of-the-nation addressPutin circa 2023 is a very different character. Seething with resentment at the ""collective West"", he styles himself as leader of a besieged fortress, repelling the alleged attempts of Russia´s enemies to destroy his country. From his speeches and comments - and his references to imperial Russian rulers like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great - Mr Putin appears to believe he is destined to recreate the Russian empire in some shape or form.But at what cost to Russia? President Putin once earned himself a reputation for bringing stability to his country. That has disappeared amid rising military casualties, mobilisation and economic sanctions. Several hundred thousand Russians have left the country since the start of the war, many of them young, skilled and educated: a brain drain that will hurt Russia´s economy even more. As a result of the war, suddenly, there are a lot of groups around with guns, including private military companies, like Yevgeny Prigozhin´s Wagner group and regional battalions. Relations with the regular armed forces are far from harmonious. The conflict between Russia´s Ministry of Defence and Wagner is an example of public infighting within the elites. Instability plus private armies is a dangerous cocktail. ""Civil war is likely to cover Russia for the next decade,"" believes Konstantin Remchukov, owner and editor of Moscow-based newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ""There are too many interest groups who understand that in these conditions there´s a chance to redistribute wealth.""""The real chance to avoid civil war will be if the right person comes to power immediately after Putin. A person who has authority over the elites and the resoluteness to isolate those eager to exploit the situation.""Image caption, Newspaper editor Konstantin Remchukov fears Russia is facing civil war""Are the Russian elites discussing who the right man or woman is?"" I ask Konstantin.""Quietly. With the lights off. They do discuss this. They will have their voice.""""And does Putin know these discussions are happening?""""He knows. I think he knows everything.""This week the speaker of the lower house of Russia´s parliament declared: ""As long as there´s Putin, there´s Russia."" It was a statement of loyalty, but not of fact. Russia will survive - it has managed to for centuries. Vladimir Putin´s fate, however, is linked irrevocably now to the outcome of the war in Ukraine.

Ukraine war: The friends who fought Russia's invasion - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Dmytro Kisilenko (left) and Maxsym Lutsyk admit they felt fear when they joined the war one year agoBy Jeremy BowenBBC News, KyivWar transforms individuals, as well as nations. When the Russian army loomed over Ukraine at the end of February 2022, two university students, Maxsym Lutsyk and Dmytro Kisilenko, decided that they could not sit idle when their country was threatened. Maxsym was 19, Dmytro was 18. I met them at a volunteer centre in central Kyiv on the day they signed up to fight. They took their big step into the unknown dressed to go to a festival, not to war. Dmytro had a yoga mat to sleep on. The older volunteers, saying goodbye to wives and children, could barely raise a smile. Young men, not long out of school, not needing to shave much, were laughing and joking, full of bravado. I suspected they didn´t feel as brave as they wanted to look. Twelve months later, I caught up with Dmytro and Maxsym in the cold winter sun back at the volunteer centre. ""Well, actually there was a lot of fear,"" Dmytro admitted. ""I´m not going to lie because I hadn´t experienced anything like that before. There were a lot of pessimistic news and we were preparing for the worst. And it was mostly like a mixture of bravery… and in our guts we felt that not everything will be all right.""Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym (left) and Dmytro (right) were students when they volunteered as recruits to fight for their countryMaxsym agreed, and many Ukrainians to whom I´ve spoken had the same sort of thoughts. ""A year ago, we had a lot of fear in our hearts and even in our brains. We understood that it will be pretty dangerous to became soldiers, to try to fight with guns. But we also had courage and we had some stupid bravery, and it helped us to overcome our fear.  ""We understood that it will be very bad for us to stay in some shelters, not act in the battle. And it will be bad for us if Russians would occupy Kyiv or other territories of Ukraine. They would kill us or put us in prison because of our political views.""They were not joining a winning army. The Americans and their allies were expecting a rapid Russian victory, followed by an insurgency that they were preparing to support. Their attitudes changed rapidly after Ukraine had shown how well it could fight with old Soviet-era weapons and a sprinkling of modern ones that Nato had supplied. Since then, Nato, led by the United States, has steadily broken its self-imposed limits on what it will supply. Main battle tanks are the latest upgrade. Ukraine wants modern warplanes next.  This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsDmytro sat in the cold sun outside the volunteer centre, marvelling at the change. ""The Russians have made their biggest mistake…  Everyone knows their enemy now. And not only it´s national unity, but it´s international unity… And it´s like someone told me two years ago that the United Kingdom, United States, all the European leaders will help us, and it´s the world, Ukraine will be spoken in every television news, I wouldn´t have imagined that."" The conflict forced the North Atlantic alliance to face up to the reality of a sharp and dangerous new division in Europe. The relationship with Moscow that had been under increasing strain for more than a decade snapped when President Putin ordered the invasion last February.With Ukraine, its people and Europe propelled into a new and dangerous era, the continent has come full circle from the hopeful years that followed the end of the Cold War. In 1989, six months before the Berlin Wall was toppled, the first President George Bush laid out the dream of a ""Europe whole and free"". It does not feel like that on the front lines in Donbas. But Kyiv today is a city transformed from the shuttered, apprehensive place it was in the first few weeks after the invasion. Snow swirled around the crowds that packed the platforms at the main railway station. Wind that felt as if it had come off the coldest part of the steppe cut into thousands of women and children, about to become refugees, who were pushing to get onto trains heading west, away from the Russians. Being there felt like watching a re-run of old newsreels from the 20th Century´s darkest times. Barriers were blocking roads, welders were making tank traps from steel girders, and thousands of bottles were being filled with petrol to make Molotov cocktails to throw at the Russian tanks everyone expected. At the moment, the capital has a veneer of normality. Shops are open, people with money can go to restaurants, and there is a rush hour. Of course, it is not normal, because the country is at war, and by mid-evening the streets are quiet. Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym Lutsyk (left) and Dmytro Kisilenko (right) believe Russia has made its biggest mistakeThe contrast between Kyiv and the battered front line towns in the war zones in the east and south is huge. Dmytro and Maxsym fought in the battle that forced a Russian retreat at the end of March. Since then, the pressure has mostly been off the capital, compared to the nightmarish months since the Russian focus turned to the Donbas and the approaches to the Crimean Peninsula in the south.  Maxsym and Dmytro are volunteers, and as students they are allowed to claim an exemption from compulsory military service. Under pressure from his family, Dmytro decided after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv to go back to university. Now he volunteers to help with supplies for Maxsym and his other former comrades. ""It was a really hard decision. But when all your battle buddies, or when all your comrades are going to the east, they continue, they are like away, and you just left this community, you feel a bit odd."" His decision does not seem to have affected their friendship. Maxsym stayed with their unit, and in the months since then has been in some of the heaviest fighting of the war, in the battles in Donbas. He looks noticeably older and is more assertive. I saw him in Bakhmut in the summer, as the Russians were starting to attack it. He had driven out of nearby Severodonetsk to get supplies for his unit. He went back that day, and not long before the town fell to the Russians, Maxsym was wounded.  Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, In May last year, three months after volunteering, Maxsym met the BBC in BakhmutIt was, he said, his worst moment of the war. His position was hit by a strike from Russian heavy artillery, a 203mm Pion. His commander, who received Ukraine´s highest award for valour, was killed. Maxsym was knocked cold and had severe concussion. The Ukrainian forces, outnumbered and outgunned, had to retreat across a river.  ""The Russians destroyed all the bridges, doing intelligence to find places where we are crossing the river and they shelled these places. So staying there for longer period of time was possible, but many guys died there. And if we stayed for a longer period, many more guys would have died in a few weeks.""Maxsym believes that Russian soldiers arrived in Ukraine a year ago swallowing Kremlin propaganda that they would be welcomed as liberators and protectors of Russian speakers. The last year of fighting, he says, on battlegrounds like Severodonetsk and Bakhmut, has wiped out any Russian illusions about what it would take to beat Ukraine. They understand, he said, that they don´t have friends waiting for them. ""They know that they will enter Bakhmut city only when they will destroy it, when they will kill every Ukrainian soldier who is defending it… They understand that they are fighting for territories and for some political reasons of their government.""Ukrainian soldiers who have served in the east do not have illusions either about an easy victory. The Russians have taken huge casualties. But they are still fighting, have capable electronic warfare and air defence systems and kill and wound many Ukrainians. The Kremlin´s appetite for a war of attrition has not slackened. Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian forces have spent months trying to capture the Ukrainian city of BakhmutDmytro and Maxsym see victory the same way as President Volodymyr Zelensky. Every piece of Ukraine needs to be recaptured. Nato has massively increased its support. But giving Ukraine decisive combat power carries too many risks, in American minds especially. A time may come when Ukraine´s allies push for negotiations.Dmytro was firm. ""Every inch of Ukrainian land which were recognized as Ukrainian in 1991 should be Ukrainian."" President Vladimir Putin believes Ukraine belongs to Russia. Ironically, the war he started is building the Ukrainian nation. ""We have a joke,"" Maxsym said. ""Putin will be made a hero of Ukraine for the job he´s done to unite Ukraine, to build our economy, to build our army, and to make the Ukrainian nation great.""Dmytro laughed. ""But yeah, the war is horrible, but it´s like the price for our unity and our country.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64733014,24,02,2023,bbc,russia

The White House´s fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $2bn (£1.7bn).A further $550m (£459m) will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.""One year on, the commitment of the United States, together with some 50 countries who have rallied to rush urgently needed assistance to Ukraine, has only strengthened,"" the Department of Defense said.Just how much money is the US spending on Ukraine?Moldova warns of Russian ´psy-ops´ as tensions riseIn a press release, the White House said the new measures were designed to disrupt Russian financial institutions, officials and authorities from ""illegitimately operating in Ukraine"".It comes four days after US President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv, where he held talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. In its latest round of aid, the US government is providing Ukraine with new drone systems, high-mobility rocket systems, ammunition for artillery systems and communications gear. Earlier this week the US said China was considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia. They also claimed Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.China has strongly denied the allegations.Why China launched a charm offensive over UkraineA meeting of G7 leaders was held on Friday, where they created an enforcement team designed to stop Russia from finding sanctions loopholes.""G7 countries will continue to keep Russia´s sovereign assets immobilised until there is a resolution to the conflict"", the group said in a press release.The G7 - group of seven - is an organisation of the world´s seven largest ""advanced"" economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. It has so far committed $39b (£32b) to Ukraine´s war efforts for 2023. The US said G7 countries and allies would also impose sanctions on key economic sectors in Russia - including its metals and mining sector.""Our actions today with our G7 partners show that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.The US added that it would provide Ukraine with electrical grid equipment to protect its energy supply from Russian strikes, and with generators to provide back-up power. The White House will provide Moldova, which borders Ukraine and heavily relies on Russian gas, with $300m (£250m) to help increase its local power generation.Moldova is Europe´s poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.

"Ukraine war: Vuhledar, the mining town Russia wants to take - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Ukraine has managed to hold Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine despite fierce Russian attempts to seize itBy Orla GuerinBBC News, Vuhledar, eastern UkraineThe commander, codenamed Beast, looked exhausted. Beneath his green helmet, dark shadows ringed his eyes. He had been on his feet all night fighting. Like many on Ukraine´s eastern front, he is both battle-hardened and war-weary.""It´s difficult. People don´t get enough sleep. They are standing for 20 hours. The fight goes on around the clock. I can´t say more, it´s secret. But, we can´t go back.""His unit, from the Ukraine´s 35th Brigade, is part of the defence of Vuhledar. The name means gift of coal, and this prosperous mining town was once home to 15,000 people. But now it´s a wasteland - one of many on Ukraine´s 1,300 kilometre (807 mile) front line.   Blackened apartment blocks tower over deserted streets. A church has been reduced to a shell - its roof peeled off and windows shattered. A cross still stands at the front, punctured by shrapnel. In the playground, there are bullet holes in the slide. Vuhledar´s children are long gone. The town sits on high ground in the heavily contested Donbas region in the east. From here Ukraine can target rail lines used by the Russians for resupply. It needs to hold this bastion. Moscow needs to take it. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent months has been here.""The front line is one kilometre away,"" said the commander, having to repeat himself over the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire, this time outgoing. ""They are pushing, and we lack armour. We are waiting for the Lend-Lease [the US programme that provides military equipment] and we will advance."" That´s a familiar refrain on front lines here as Ukraine awaits Western battle tanks promised by its allies.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, The commander, codenamed Beast, says Ukraine´s forces are waiting for Western weapons before advancingFor now, the defenders of Vuhledar use what they have got.A few troops dart into position, to target the enemy. They lob mortars - and obscenities - then make a quick getaway, to avoid being targeted themselves.We move forward carefully to within 500 metres of the front line. The Russians have no line of sight. We are shielded by buildings. But suddenly there´s a warning shout. We have to take cover at a wall. The troops have heard something overhead, possibly a Russian drone. That´s our cue to pull back.The Russians may have eyes in the sky here - and superior firepower - but critics back home are questioning their vision.A hapless Russian attempt to take the town earlier this month ended in heavy losses and humiliation. A column of tanks and armoured vehicles headed straight for Ukrainian positions - through minefields - in full view on a flat plain. Ukraine stopped them in their tracks, much as it stopped an armoured column approaching Kyiv last year. If the Russians learned anything from that, it didn´t show in Vuhledar.About 300 souls remain in this broken town without heat or light - frozen in place by age, clinging to their memories. Solace comes in the form of Oleh Tkachenko, a jovial evangelical pastor in combat gear, who brings aid here twice a week.  Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Pastor Oleh (right) gives out food and hugs on aid trips to VuhledarHe arrives in the early morning, before the shelling reaches its peak. Soon his armoured van attracts a queue of men and women bundled up in winter coats and hats. ""Hang on,"" he says, as hands reach out for freshly baked bread. ""It´s one loaf for each person.""Valentina, who is 73, quietly waits her turn. She´s a slight figure, bent low over a walking stick, with a head torch around her neck. She tells us she has nowhere else to go.""We are frightened, of course,"" she says. ""But what can we do? We live with it. You can´t say ´Don´t shoot!´ They have their job. We have our lives.""  She recalls life before the invasion. ""The town was quiet, calm, and clean. People worked and had money. What can I say? It was a good town."" Her voice cracks and she falls silent.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Valentina is one of just 300 residents remaining in the embattled townAt the van Pastor Oleh dispenses some advice, and a quick hug before hurrying people away. Crowds are a target.""There´s always shelling,"" he says. ""We try not to gather a lot of people. We park carefully, in the safest places, near the entrance to a building where people can take shelter. We help because it´s a matter of life or death. The risk is huge but so is the reward - saving people´s lives.""  He´s pained by the fate of Vuhledar, which was his home for three years. ""I think it´s completely obvious that Russia hates Ukraine,"" he says. ""It hates our cities and our people, and it is destroying everything it hates. No matter what Russia says, its action scream louder than its words.""The story of Vuhledar is replicated in many parts of the eastern front. Ukraine is resisting, straining every sinew. The Russians are not winning but they aren´t giving up either.There is a cold hard truth on the front lines here. One year after his invasion, President Putin stills holds almost a fifth of this vast country. Both sides have signalled that major offensives are coming. The coming months will be critical.

How the Ukraine war is creating family rifts in Russia - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Anastasia PopovaImage caption, Uliana discussing the war in Ukraine with her father BorisBy BBC Eye Investigations World ServiceUliana is weeping as her brother´s coffin is lowered into the ground.The 37-year-old actress is attending the funeral of Vanya, a Russian soldier killed on the front line in Ukraine. ""They said he died a hero,"" says Uliana of 23-year-old Vanya. ""I thought, ´What does it mean, like a hero?´ It´s absurd. I don´t want a dead hero for a brother.""But her father Boris, though also stricken with grief, is proud that his son Vanya died fighting for his country. His view is that the conflict is a battle against ""a government that preaches fascism"". This claim echoes the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who says he is helping to de-Nazify Ukraine and that its government has carried out genocide - a claim for which there is no evidence. ""Before this happened with Vanya, we didn´t discuss the war,"" says Uliana describing her relationship with her father. ""But after he died we had some awful fights about it.""Image source, Anastasia PopovaImage caption, Uliana at her brother Vanya´s funeralIn a new film for BBC Storyville, father and daughter debate the war - a conversation playing out within many families in Russia today.  It is hard to get an accurate picture of exactly how people in the country feel about Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, given legislation which outlaws any comments deemed to discredit the military, or which refer to the military action as a war rather than a ""special military operation"". But a survey published in November 2022 by an independent Russian research group suggests it is dividing generations - 75% of respondents aged 40 and over said they supported the war, compared with 62% of those aged 18-24.Russian filmmaker Anastasia Popova says this chimed with her own perception as she travelled round the country to shoot the documentary. ""I observed lots of different ruptures between families. Their children were mostly against the war, and their parents - the generation brought up during the Soviet Union, who watched [state-run] TV day and night  - supported the war. I have the same rupture within my family,"" she adds, saying her father supports the military action.Relying on state TV for news means absorbing the official narrative of the Russian government day after day. Uliana, and others of her age group, are more likely to get their news from other outlets, such as YouTube and social media. ""´Sorry´ can´t come close to expressing the grief I feel inside,"" says Uliana. She says the war has changed people.""I watch people on the metro [in Moscow]. They read the news, then look away. They´ve stopped looking each other in the eye."" Popova stresses that outside the big cities, support for the war is greater, regardless of the demographic. She says this became clear while she was filming Vanya´s funeral in their home village of Arkhangelskoe, 60 miles [97km] outside Moscow. Uliana speaks of this moment of recognition too. ""When I was watching those people, it came to me that they really believed the words that they were saying,"" she says, ""[which were] that Vanya died like a hero, a true patriot who defended his motherland.""I know that something is wrong. Who are we supposed to be saving there? What are our boys dying for? I never imagined in my life that my brother would be brought to me in a zinc coffin.""Vanya was the youngest of four siblings, and the only son. ""He was a golden boy,"" Uliana says.""He had a broad upbringing,"" Boris explains. ""Art school, music school, sport… I put everything I dreamed of into him.""After leaving home, Vanya joined a literary institute in Moscow to study creative writing and also acted in experimental productions, including at the Bolshoi Theatre. Boris says this led to heartbreak for Vanya, who fell in love with a girl who didn´t want to get married.""This is the theatre world. With its own views of life. Its own ethical and moral criteria. In place of family values, they have open relationships between men and women,"" says Boris.Image source, IvanImage caption, Vanya was heavily involved in the Moscow arts scene before joining the armyUliana says Vanya seemed extremely happy in the theatre, but his father suggests that it provoked some kind of crisis in his son.""He was not satisfied with their view of the world, that they are always negative about Russia; that Russians are nobody to them; that their ancestors, the whole history of Russia is full of nonsense. He understands that he´s not like that. We talked about it. What should he do?""So, Boris says, he and Vanya agreed that he should join the military.""For a life in the creative arts.. you need life experience,"" says Boris. ""Where can you find it? We decided he should follow in the footsteps of the great writers. That´s the army.""Vanya joined the army as a conscript - and then, wanting more interesting challenges, took a military contract. He was a marine based in the city of Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea when Russia launched its major assault on cities across Ukraine in February last year. He was told to call his family to say goodbye before being sent to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.""We talked for a long time, over an hour,"" says Uliana. ""He had tears in his eyes. I said: ´Vanya, show me what you have there.´ He showed me a machine gun. Like he used to show me toys as a kid.""Boris shows a clip of Vanya´s video message to him. ""Our cause is just,"" Vanya is saying. ""Hello to everyone. I´ll write when I get there. Hugs and kisses.""""Those were his last words,"" Boris says.Storyville - Inside Russia: Traitors and HeroesDespite the huge risks, two Russian filmmakers have been filming the impact of the invasion of Ukraine in their country. Many thousands have fled. Those that have stayed have had to make a choice - oppose the war, support it, or stay silent. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)Viewers outside the UK can watch now, on YouTube (short version)He was killed near the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol on 15 March.His death brought Uliana´s and Boris´s different views on the war into sharp focus. Boris tells Uliana that she is too young to remember what he refers to as the ""brotherhood"" of the Soviet Union republics. He argues that its fall ""broke the psyche of many generations to come, drumming into their heads that the Russians were their enemy"".His language is reminiscent of President Putin, who has called the fall of the Soviet empire the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] Century"". Ukraine declared independence shortly before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.The Russian president also puts blame for the war at the doorstep of Nato and the West, which he argues is trying to weaken and ultimately destroy Russia. Boris follows this narrative too.""In today´s context, ´No to war´ only means one thing,"" Boris tells Uliana. ""It means ´Death to the Russians´. This is a struggle for the Russian world, for the Russian soul, for our culture.""It is clearly not a view held by Uliana although she does, from time to time, waver. Popova captures a moment when Uliana is on holiday in Georgia - one of the few countries Russians can still visit because of sanctions - and she and her friends discuss the war over dinner. Uliana begins to question the facts.""I want to believe that my brother did not die in vain. You want to justify the loss. It´s so painful. You need to hold on to something,"" Uliana explains. A small shrine has been erected in Vanya´s memory in the family home. It includes soil gathered from Mariupol where he died. At times father and daughter have stood before it together.Uliana says that for all their differences she wants to maintain a relationship with her father.""I can´t go to war against my own father. I can´t say ´I hate you because we disagree.´ All I can say is ´Dad, I don´t agree. That´s all I can say.´""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished4 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished1 hour agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished55 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Fire at security building in Russia's Rostov-on-Don - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Flames engulf Russian security building in Rostov-on-DonBy Robert GreenallBBC NewsAt least one person has been killed and two injured in a fire at a building used by Russia´s Federal Security Service (FSB) in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, Russian media say.Dramatic footage on social media shows a large blaze, with smoke visible all over the city.Rostov´s regional governor said a short circuit appeared to have caused the fire, which ignited fuel tanks.The street where the building is located has been cordoned off.The blaze occurred at a building belonging to the FSB´s regional border patrol section in a built-up area of the city.The FSB is Russia´s internal security service and is responsible for counter-intelligence, border security and counter-terrorism. Rostov Governor Vassily Golubev said the fire had spread over 800 sq m, causing two walls to collapse.In a statement, the FSB´s public relations office said the blaze started at around 12:30 local time (09:30 GMT). It also confirmed there had been fatalities, but offered no further details. Authorities managed put out the blaze by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT), Russian media reported.The city is the capital of the southern Rostov region bordering on the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, currently the scene of intense fighting in the war.There have been a spate of arson attacks on government buildings in Russia, such as enlistment and conscription offices, since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Ukraine denied involvement in the fire.Presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said on Twitter that the incident was a ""manifestation of panic"" in Russia. ""Ukraine doesn´t interfere, but watches with pleasure,"" he said.Related TopicsRussiaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished4 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished1 hour agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished55 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Why is South Africa's navy joining exercises with Russia and China? - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Russian fleet, led by the Admiral Gorshkov warshipSouth Africa is holding a joint military exercise with Russia and China that opposition figures say amounts to an endorsement of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.The US has also criticised the 10-day naval drills, which will continue over the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine.But South Africa´s government says it remains neutral regarding the conflict, and that it routinely hosts similar drills with other countries, including France and the US.What are South Africa, Russia and China doing?The naval exercises, called Mosi, which means ""smoke"" in the Tswana language, are taking place in the Indian Ocean, off the South African coast.The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says 350 members of its armed forces will take part.Russia has announced it will send its Admiral Gorshkov warship, which carries Zircon hypersonic missiles. These fly at nine times the speed of sound and have a range of 1,000 km (620 miles).  Moscow ""will be trying to show that despite its setbacks in the war in Ukraine, its armed forces are still very powerful"", says Denys Reva from South Africa´s Institute for Security Studies.The SANDF has said little about the forthcoming exercise, but a 2019 joint drill between the three countries involved seven ships - one warship from each nation, plus fuelling ships and survey ships. They practised tackling coastal fires and floods, and recapturing ships from pirates.How Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaWhy is this exercise controversial?A White House spokesperson said in January: ""The United States has concerns about any country... exercising with Russia as Russia wages a brutal war against Ukraine.""South Africa previously abstained from a UN vote condemning the invasion. It also refused to join the US and Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia. The South African government sparked a political row when it gave permission for a superyacht called the Nord, which is linked to the sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov, to dock in Cape Town - although it is thought the vessel did not actually go there.The sanctioned Russian cargo ship, Lady R, was also allowed to unload supplies at a South African naval base. The government said it contained a delayed order for ammunition.South Africa points out it has held four joint exercises with the US since 2011, as well as drills with France and Germany.""All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,"" said Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, during a visit to her country by her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in January.She said that trying to stop South Africa from conducting joint military exercises with the countries of its choice amounted to ""an abuse of international practice"".What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Why is South Africa taking part?South Africa is also taking part because its armed forces are underfunded and overstretched, according to Elizabeth Sidiropoulos, head of the South African Institute of International Affairs. The navy´s priorities are to protect fisheries in its home waters and combat piracy in the Indian Ocean.""It needs to team up with other nations to have the capacity to deal with things off its coast such as piracy,"" she says.Image source, ReutersImage caption, South African foreign minister Nalida Pandor hosted a visit from her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in JanuarySouth Africa´s governing African National Congress (ANC) also has long-standing ties with Russia. These date back to the years of white-minority rule before 1994, says Dr Alex Vines from the Chatham House think-tank in London.""The older leaders in the ANC still have an emotional attachment to Moscow, because it constantly supported their struggle,"" he says. ""That makes it very difficult for South Africa to turn its back on Russia over Ukraine.""Russia, China and South Africa also have modern-day ties because they are all members of the Brics alliance.The group - which also includes Brazil and India - represents some of the world´s leading emerging economies.What do Russia and China want?Ms Sidiropoulos says Russia has more to gain than anyone from this year´s exercise. ""It shows that Russia can still project its power far away, and that it still has allies around the world.""It lets them say that it´s not the world that´s against Russia. Only the West is against Russia."" China is keen to keep shipping lanes open for commercial vessels travelling from its ports to African destinations, says Dr Vines.It also wants to establish its naval power in the Indian Ocean, off the African coast.""It´s about getting its navy out into international waters.""China already uses Djibouti on the East African coast as a naval base to combat piracy, and perhaps it is hoping to get more bases.""Related TopicsSouth AfricaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished4 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished1 hour agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished55 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Some were housed on cruise ships, some in hotels and others were taken in by host families.While the war rages on at home, Oléna believes the thousands of Ukrainian mothers who left the country to find safety are a different kind of soldier, fighting to keep their children safe.""It was almost impossible to make the decision because all my life was in Ukraine,"" she said. ""I had my husband, a family, a job, a house a dog, and a lot of plans for our future lives. ""We were adult people with strong ideas of our future and how to raise our child in Ukraine.

Oléna tries to speak to her parents every day but worries about them.Her biggest hope is to see in the news that the war is over. But for now, they would like more permanent accommodation. Oléna is grateful she feels safe but she would like to cook her son a meal, do her own laundry and to have their own space.A university lecturer and academic in Ukraine, Oléna has started a job at a city university doing admin.""I am happy that I can bring something here and become a tax payer here. I feel like a real part of this Glasgow community,"" she added.Until the mother and son can return to Ukraine, they say they will be brave - a word Oléna said was used a lot to describe Ukrainians. ""Not only for the soldiers who fight on the front line, but for every Ukrainian woman who takes her children and tries to look around the world for a safe place to raise them,"" she said.""Brave for teachers and doctors who stay in Ukraine and help people.

Moldova warns of Russian 'psy-ops' as tensions rise - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ROBERT GHEMENT/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockImage caption, Moldova´s President Maia Sandu has warned that some are hoping to install a Russian puppet government in her countryBy Paul KirbyBBC NewsMoldova´s leaders have rejected Russian claims that Ukraine is planning to attack the country´s breakaway pro-Russian territory, and called for calm.Russia´s defence ministry alleged, with no evidence, that Ukrainian saboteurs dressed as Russian troops would attack from Transnistria, to provide a pretext for a Ukrainian invasion.Moldova has warned for weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.And officials rejected Russia´s claims as ""psy-ops"" as part of the war.""The defence ministry believes it is an element of a psychological operation rather than a real plan,"" said state secretary Valeriu Mija. Leading MP Doina Gherman told Moldovan media that the Russian allegations were ""aggressive disinformation"". There was no imminent threat and she urged the public to trust the government.Moldovan President Maia Sandu, on a visit to neighbouring Romania on Thursday, spoke of unprecedented security challenges ahead. ""Some wanted our country to fall and to install in Chisinau a puppet government enslaved to the interests of the Kremlin,"" she said.Moldova is not part of Nato but last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine, bringing it one step closer to joining the bloc. Earlier this week the Moldovan leader met US President Joe Biden, who promised to support her country´s sovereignty.However, on Moldova´s eastern flank lies a narrow strip of land called Transnistria, between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border. This breakaway region has a contingent of Russian peacekeepers, and Moscow has warned that any threat to its security will be treated as an attack on Russia itself.Challenges created by war in UkraineWith a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe´s poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.It has faced a major energy crisis because its power infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era. Not only did Russia restrict its gas supplies but its attacks on Ukraine´s power grid had knock-on effects.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsRampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by the populist and pro-Russian Sor party, led by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor. There has also been an apparent escalation of incidents described by new Prime Minister Dorin Recean as ""hybrid attacks"". A Russian missile was fired at Ukraine through Moldovan airspace on the day the previous government collapsed earlier this month, in the face of what the former PM called ""multiple crises"".Moldovan government resigns after multiple crisesPresident Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova´s leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one ""at the service of Russia"".Shortly after her speech, twelve Serbian football fans were barred from entering Chisinau for a match. Fighters of a boxing club from Montenegro were barred from entering Chisinau for a tournament too.The Kremlin accused Moldova´s leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be ""very, very careful"" with their statements.Political analyst Denis Cenusa said Moldova´s weakest point for pro-Russian forces was its internal socio-economic stability. If Russia failed in the short term, he said it could succeed at the ballot box in local elections this year and the presidential vote in 2024.Find a solution for TransnistriaDominated by Russian speakers, Transnistria proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by 1,500 Russian troops stationed there.As long as Transnistria´s future remains unclear, tensions will remain. Moldova´s new prime minister sees demilitarising the area as a priority and the foreign ministry has said it will continue to seek a peaceful solution.But President Putin has pointedly revoked a 2012 decree committing Russia to finding a solution for Transnistria based on respect for Moldova´s sovereignty and territorial integrity.As soon as Russian forces invaded southern Ukraine a year ago there were fears they would try to seize Odesa and the entire coast to Transnistria.  That has not happened, but what Moldova´s leaders are warning of now is reminiscent of what happened in April 2022.A series of mysterious explosions were reported, which separatist authorities in Transnistria said targeted their state security HQ, old Soviet-era radio masts and a military unit.Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" were held responsible then as well by Transnistria´s authorities. Kyiv blamed Russian special services, warning they were seeking to threaten Moldova and destabilise the situation.Earlier this week a pro-separatist social media channel said it had seen Ukrainian military equipment on the motorway linking Ukraine to Moldova, but an unconvincing photo showed only a couple of small armoured vehicles and a Ukrainian flag.Russia´s defence ministry claimed it had detected a ""significant amount of [Ukrainian] personnel and military vehicles"" near Transnistria and said they carried a direct threat to Russia´s peacekeeping force, but again it offered no evidence.The head of Transnistria´s peacekeeping body, Oleg Belyakov, said there was no panic among its population but Russia´s warnings did ""give reasons for serious concerns"".Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warMoldovaRomaniaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64746801,24,02,2023,bbc,russia
MH17: Human rights court will hear Netherlands case against Russia - BBC News,"Related TopicsMH17 plane crashImage source, ReutersImage caption, The wreckage of MH17 was painstakingly reassembled in the Netherlands and later inspected as part of the trialBy Anna Holligan in The Hague and Laura Gozzi in LondonBBC NewsThe European Court of Human Rights has confirmed it will hear a Dutch case against Russia over the downing of flight MH17 in 2014.All 298 people on the Malaysia Airlines flight from Amsterdam were killed when it was shot down by a missile fired by Moscow-backed Ukrainian separatists.The Dutch government argues that Russia´s disinformation about Moscow´s role in the incident is a violation of the relatives´ human rights. Russia denies the allegations.The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine. The Netherlands argues that Russia played a key role in the air disaster and the case hinges on whether or not Moscow had ""effective control"" over the area of Ukraine where the missile was fired from.At this stage, the ECHR´s decision is only procedural and does not rule on the merits of the case, but it shows the court believes Russia can be held accountable for the human rights violations in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.It could be years before a ruling is issued, but if the ECHR issues a guilty verdict against Russia, Moscow could be obliged to pay damages to the victims´ relatives. Last September, Russia stopped being party to the European Convention on Human Rights, but the court can still deal with claims against Russia regarding actions up until that date.In November, a Dutch court at the Schiphol Judicial Complex found three men - two Russians and a Ukrainian - guilty of murder in absentia for their part in the downing of MH17. The court concluded that the missile had been fired deliberately to bring down a plane, even if the target had been military rather than civilian.The three men were sentenced to life in jail but are all thought to be in Russia. Since Moscow condemned the verdict as scandalous and politically motivated it is extremely unlikely that they will be handed over to face justice.Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the attack.

Why Russia's invasion of Ukraine still divides Africa - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesBy Anne SoySenior Africa correspondentA year since Russia invaded Ukraine, opinion about the war among African countries appears not to have shifted much. Thirty countries - just two more than last year - voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution that condemned Russia, supported Ukraine´s territorial integrity, and called for peace. Madagascar and South Sudan, who both abstained on a similar resolution last year, voted in favour this time. Morocco also missed the 2022 vote but cast its ballot in favour of the resolution on Thursday. African nations accounted for nearly half of all abstentions. Gabon, which changed its vote from being in favour of the pro-Ukraine resolution last year, was among the 15 African countries that abstained. Officially, these countries say their position is not aligned with either Russia or Western-backed Ukraine. Despite an increase in engagement and visits from senior officials from Western countries, as well as Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers over the past year, their stance has not shifted.Image caption, A Russian warship is taking part in military exercises in South AfricaA day before the latest UN assembly, Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni - but that last-minute intervention did not sway the vote. Namibia, which hosted US First Lady Jill Biden on her maiden tour of Africa this week, also did not budge.""It´s not flipping a light switch,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told The Atlantic, acknowledging the diplomatic challenge the West faces in winning support for Ukraine in some African countries. He expressed optimism, however, that South Africa - which is currently hosting 10 days military exercises with China and Russia - was ""on a slow trajectory"" away from Russia. The South African authorities have denied the war games were provocatively timed to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.Why ties to Russia are strong in some parts AfricaSome African countries had a decades-long relationship with the Soviet Union. After it collapsed in 1991, these ties continued with Russia, with many African independence leaders saying supplies of weapons and military training were key in helping the fight against white-minority rule and colonialism.In South Africa, during the struggle against apartheid, the US government designated the Africa National Congress - today´s ruling party - a terrorist group. Its leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were also classed as terrorists. Despite winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, jointly with the last apartheid leader Frederik de Klerk, and becoming the country´s first black president from 1994 to 1999, Mandela remained on the US terror watchlist until it was revised in 2008. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela (C) speak to a Soviet delegation during Namibia´s independence ceremony in 1990""Of course, unfortunately, more than unfortunately, the United States was much too sympathetic to the apartheid regime, so that history also doesn´t get erased, you know, overnight,"" Mr Blinken told The Atlantic.But the colonial past doesn´t entirely explain the current relationship, at least for some countries.Nations like Eritrea and lately Mali - both largely isolated from the global community - have found an ally in Russia. They were among the African countries which recently hosted Russia´s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and both voted against the pro-Ukraine UN resolution.Mali´s military leaders last year ordered all French troops to leave the country, and have invited the Russian Wagner Group of mercenaries to replace them in helping fight an Islamist insurgency in the country.Seven other African countries - Senegal, Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea Bissau and Cameroon - did not vote at all. The first three voted to abstain last year.It is not possible to generalise the reaction and sentiment of a continent of more than 50 countries. Each would have their own reasons for whichever way they voted. And while the vote is not legally binding, it will no doubt continue to shape geopolitical alliances in the months and years to come.

Ukraine war: India abstains from UN vote on Russian invasion - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, India and Russia have a history of diplomatic and defence relationsIndia has once again abstained from voting in a UN General Assembly resolution that condemned Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, which started a year ago.The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven, including Russia, voting against it.India reiterated its position on the invasion, saying that peaceful dialogue was the only way out.Delhi has increasingly faced pressure to take a firm stand on Russia.Many countries, including the US and Ukraine, have publicly appealed to Delhi to take a clear stand and ""do the right thing"". But India has resisted the pressure and continued with its strategy of not criticising Russia directly. It has abstained from similar resolutions both at the UNGA and at the UNSC in the past. The two countries have a decades-old trusted relationship since the Cold War. Russia is also India´s largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped in recent years largely due to Delhi´s decision to boost domestic defence manufacturing and a widening imports portfolio.The two countries also have a history of diplomatic co-operation - Moscow has vetoed UNSC resolutions over the disputed region of Kashmir.Delhi, however, has talked about the importance of ""the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"" in its past statements on Ukraine.

"Bakhmut, Kyiv, and other key Ukrainian cities ahead of Russia spring offensive - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warBy James WaterhouseBBC Ukraine correspondentYou´re going to hear the term ""spring offensive"" a lot in the coming weeks of the war in Ukraine. In a traditional military sense, it´s when armies look to generate momentum after using the poor winter conditions to replenish. It is true that the fighting has become more static during typically cold conditions. However, all signs seem to be pointing towards an upcoming Russian push. Moscow has mobilised hundreds of thousands more men, as well as increased its production of weapons and ammunition. Kyiv is expecting to see major attacks from the east and south as soon as 24 February, which would mark a year since the full-scale invasion. So, if Russia does launch another offensive, what will it try to take?BakhmutImage source, EPAImage caption, Bakhmut has been virtually flattened during months of heavy fightingIt´s the eastern city which has been grabbing the headlines because of the endless conflicting claims over who controls it. For now, Kyiv isn´t hinting at a tactical retreat. It claims the Russians are suffering about 500 casualties per day as they stage relentless attacks. Ukraine reckons its own losses are not as high.Regular Russian forces appear to have replaced mercenaries from the Wagner Group as they continue to surround the city. For now, Ukrainian troops are continuing to hold it. If or when the city falls, invading forces are expected to push towards the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. It could allow Moscow to capture the entire eastern Donetsk region, one of its official goals. But that would involve capturing more than 4,000 square miles (10,360 sq km). In a period where Russia has been making minimal, costly gains, the Ukrainians would have to be seriously overpowered, or taken by surprise. VuhledarImage source, ReutersImage caption, Vuhledar is now a ghost town as almost all residents have fled the townAfter trying and failing last November, Russian forces have started launching attacks on the small town of Vuhledar, also in the Donetsk region.It sits on the south-eastern curve of the current battlefield and is significant for Moscow for two reasons. Firstly, it´s close to the only rail line linking the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russian-controlled territories in the east. It´s from Vuhledar that Ukrainian forces have been firing artillery at Russian supply trains. Vuhledar is like Bakhmut in that for the Russians it carries more symbolic than military significance. Ukraine is convinced Moscow is going to chase its two main goals as quickly as possible. Alongside capturing the whole of Donbas (Luhansk and Donetsk regions), Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought to be looking to widen the land corridor he has seized between Crimea and Russia. The capture of Vuhledar would certainly go towards those - but it would be more valuable to the Kremlin in a propaganda sense. Military milestones help the Kremlin to justify its ""special military operation"" back in Russia, as well as appease critics. They also could provide President Putin with a political way out, if he can keep hold of what he seizes. ZaporizhzhiaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Zaporizhzhia - which has been regularly shelled by Russia - is seen as a gateway to the south of UkraineAway from the eastern front, the conflict line south of the city Zaporizhzhia is another direction Kyiv is worried about. The concern is that Russian forces could push north towards the towns of Orikhiv and Pokrovsk (the latter is in Donetsk region). If this were to happen, it would push back the firing positions of longer-range Ukrainian missiles which can strike deep into the land corridor Russia controls further south. Given that American HIMARS have been able to travel up to 80km (50 miles), and are about to go up to 120km, the occupied cities of Melitopol and Tokmak are comfortably within Ukraine´s range. Moscow is also wary of a Ukrainian advance here too towards Melitopol. Kyiv has talked about the importance of the city before, saying its liberation would allow Ukraine to cut off Russian supply routes to Crimea. However, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, the Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine´s Armed Forces, has also admitted his troops don´t have the numbers of equipment for such an attack.KharkivThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Building hit by missile in Kharkiv´s Freedom SquareDespite being less than 25 miles from the border with Russia, Ukraine´s second largest city in the north-east has never fallen into Moscow´s control. Like so many areas, it has been mostly torn apart from Russia´s attempts to snatch it from Kyiv´s control. Kharkiv´s population has endured almost constant missile strikes and resulting blackouts throughout this winter. Authorities say while there hasn´t been an increase in nearby enemy forces, Russians have been shelling civilian areas more frequently. Some officers in the local military have said they ""wouldn´t be surprised"" if the Russians launched another attack, especially with the frozen ground.While there is no guarantee Russia could take a city it has failed to penetrate over the past year, its capture would bring a significant strategic advantage. Invading forces could seal the city off from Kyiv, which could prevent Ukrainian troops currently south of Kharkiv from retreating to the capital.KyivImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Early in the full-scale invasion Russian troops got within several kilometres of Kyiv, but were driven back by Ukrainian troopsUkraine´s capital is still Russia´s ultimate prize. However, this isn´t 2022. Last year, joint military exercises between Belarus and Russia turned into an advance on Kyiv when Moscow used its ally as a launchpad for its invasion. At the start of this year there were fears of history repeating itself when both countries announced drills once more - this time in the form of ""defensive"" air force exercises north of Ukraine. Belarus denied it had plans to join the invasion. Moscow rejected claims it had tried to force it. Now, both the West and Ukraine seem to agree on there being no intelligence suggesting the capital could be under the threat it faced last year. Plus, Russia used its best-trained forces during its first attempt, when its goal was to topple the Ukrainian government. ""We do not see formed assault groups capable of reaching Kyiv,"" said Ukraine´s outgoing Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov.""Besides, it is impossible to capture Kyiv in principle. It is a large city with four million people, ready to defend themselves.""If Russia indeed launches a large-scale offensive and gains momentum, Mr Reznikov´s successor could give a different assessment.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivZaporizhzhiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64533495,06,02,2023,bbc,russia
What is Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries in Ukraine? - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersTens of thousands of mercenaries are believed to be fighting for Russia in Ukraine. They belong to an organisation called the Wagner Group, which has been used in Russian military operations in many countries.Who are the Wagner Group´s mercenaries? ""Wagner almost certainly now commands 50,000 fighters in Ukraine and has become a key component of the Ukraine campaign,"" according to the UK Ministry of Defence. It says the organisation started recruiting in large numbers last year because Russia had trouble finding people for the regular army.About 80% of its troops in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council.Before Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, it is thought the Wagner Group had only about 5,000 fighters.They were mostly experienced former soldiers - many of them from Russia´s elite regiments and special forces.Although mercenary forces are illegal in Russia, the Wagner Group registered as a company in 2022 and opened a new headquarters in St Petersburg.""It is openly recruiting in Russian cities, on billboards, and is being named in Russian media as a patriotic organisation,"" says Dr Samuel Ramani, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank.US to designate Russia´s Wagner as a criminal groupUproar in Serbia over Wagner recruiting for RussiaWhat is the Wagner Group doing in Ukraine?The Wagner Group has been heavily involved in Russian efforts to capture the city of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine.Ukrainian troops say Wagner fighters have been sent into attacks in large numbers over open ground, with many killed as a result.After Russia claimed to have captured the town of Soledar, near Bakhmut, a row broke out between its defence ministry and the Wagner Group over who should get the credit.At first, the defence ministry did not mention that the Wagner Group was involved in the fighting. However, it then conceded that its mercenaries had played a ""courageous and selfless"" role.Uproar in Serbia over Wagner recruiting for RussiaTanzanian killed in Ukraine: We told him not to goHow was the Wagner Group started? A BBC investigation into the Wagner Group highlighted the believed involvement of a former Russian army officer, Dmitri Utkin. A veteran of Russia´s wars in Chechnya, he is thought to have been Wagner´s first field commander and to have named it after his former radio call sign.The head is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rich businessman nicknamed ""Putin´s chef"" because he provided catering for the Kremlin. Image caption, Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has been seen in leaked footage addressing prisoners in RussiaThe Wagner Group´s first operation was helping Russia annex Crimea in 2014, says Tracey German, professor of conflict and security at King´s College London. ""Its mercenaries are thought to have been some of the ´little green men´ who occupied the region,"" says Prof German, referring to the troops who appeared on the streets of Crimea in uniforms without any identifying markings.In the weeks before Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, it is thought Wagner carried out ""false flag"" attacks to give the Kremlin a pretext for attacking.Russia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarWhere else is the Wagner Group operating? Since 2015, Wagner Group mercenaries have been in Syria, fighting alongside pro-government forces and guarding oilfields.There are also Wagner Group mercenaries in Libya, supporting the forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar.The Central African Republic (CAR) has invited the Wagner Group to guard diamond mines, and it is thought to be guarding gold mines in Sudan. Image source, @RSOTM telegram groupImage caption, Wagner members in SyriaThe government of Mali, in West Africa, is using the Wagner Group against Islamic militant groups.Yevgeny Prigozhin is thought to make money from Wagner Group operations abroad.The US Treasury says he uses its presence to enrich mining companies which he owns and has placed them under sanctions.An unnamed White House spokesman told Reuters that Mr Prigozhin may want the Wagner Group to capture Bakhmut so he can control salt and gypsum mines in the area.

He claims to have witnessed war crimes in Ukraine.Three Wagner Group mercenaries are alleged by Ukrainian prosecutors to have killed and tortured civilians near Kyiv in April 2022, alongside regular Russian troops.German intelligence says Wagner mercenaries may also have massacred civilians in Bucha in March 2022.The United Nations and the French government have accused Wagner mercenaries of committing rapes and robberies against civilians in the Central African Republic.In 2020, the United States military accused Wagner mercenaries of having planted landmines and other improvised explosive devices in and around the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

Has Putin's war failed and what does Russia want from Ukraine? - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Ukraine´s recapture of Kherson City was one of Russia´s biggest setbacksBy Paul KirbyBBC NewsWhen Vladimir Putin sent up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine on 24 February 2022, he wrongly assumed he could sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days and depose the government.After a series of humiliating retreats, his initial invasion plan has clearly failed, but Russia´s war is far from over.Why did Putin invade?Even now, Russia´s leader describes the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two as a ""special military operation"". Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country. His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014. He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine´s neutral status.President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine´s elected president. ""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser. Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine.For years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century.In Kherson: Joy, tears and talk of justiceHow Putin changed his war aimsA month into the invasion and his campaign goals were dramatically scaled back after a retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. The main goal became the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine´s two industrial regions in the east of Luhansk and Donetsk.Forced into further retreats from Kharkiv in the north-east and Kherson in the south, that aim remains unchanged, but it has shown little success in achieving it.Those reverses on the battlefield rushed Russia´s leader into annexing four Ukrainian provinces last September, without having full control of any of them: neither Luhansk or Donetsk in the east, nor Kherson or Zaporizhzhia to the south. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vladimir Putin celebrated annexing Ukrainian territory: ""Together forever"" is written at the top of the screenTo bolster his depleted forces President Putin announced Russia´s first mobilisation since World War Two, although it was partial and limited to some 300,000 reservists. A war of attrition is now taking place along an active front line of 850km (530 miles) and Russian victories are small and rare. What was meant to be a quick operation is now a protracted war that Western leaders are determined Ukraine should win. Any realistic prospect of neutrality for Ukraine is long gone.Russia must be defeated but not crushed - MacronPresident Putin warned in December that the war ""could be a lengthy process"", but then added later that Russia´s goal was ""not to spin the flywheel of military conflict"", but to end it. There is little hope of that on the horizon.A year into the war, he talks of Russia fighting to defend its ""historical frontiers"" and ""rebuilding peaceful life in Donbas and Novorossiya"", spelling out that Ukraine´s southern territories are part of his project, just as much as the east.What gains has Russia made?The biggest success President Putin can lay claim to is establishing a land bridge from Russia´s border to Crimea, annexed illegally in 2014, so it is no longer reliant on its bridge over the Kerch Strait. He has spoken of the capture of this territory, which includes the cities of Mariupol and Melitopol, as a ""significant result for Russia"". The Sea of Azov, inside the Kerch Strait, ""has become Russia´s internal sea"", he declared, pointing out that even Russian Tsar Peter the Great did not manage that. Tracking the war in mapsIs Russia losing the war?Beyond seizing a territorial corridor to Crimea, Russia´s bloody, unprovoked war has been a disaster for itself and the country it was unleashed on. So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military.While cities such as Mariupol were flattened, details of war crimes have emerged against civilians in Bucha, near Kyiv, and have led to an independent report that accused Russia itself of state-orchestrated incitement to genocide.But it is the military failures that have shown Russia at its weakest:The retreat of 30,000 Russian troops across the Dnipro river from Kherson in November was a strategic failureA 56km (35-mile) armoured convoy that ground to a halt near Kyiv at the start of the war was a logistical failureThe deaths of a large number of recently mobilised troops in a Ukrainian new-year missile attack on Makiivka were an intelligence failureThe sinking of the flagship Black Sea battle cruiser the Moskva was a defensive failure, as was the spectacular attack in October 2022 that shut the Kerch Strait bridge for weeks.Russia´s warnings to the West against arming Ukraine have gone unheeded, with Western assurances of support ""for as long as it takes"" and pledges that Nato will never be divided. Superior US Himars missiles helped turn the course of the war and German Leopard 2 tanks are promised, even if Western fighter jets are not. A succession of Western leaders, including President Joe Biden, have made the complex journey to Kyiv.But this war is not over. The fight for Donbas continues. Russia has captured the town of Soledar this year and has hopes of seizing the eastern city of Bakhmut on the road to key cities to the west, and of recapturing territory it lost last autumn.Putin watchers believe he will seek to extend control of the four regions that he has declared to be part of Russia, not just in Donbas, but towards the key city of Zaporizhzhia.Should he need to, President Putin could extend mobilisation and drag out the war. Russia is a nuclear power and he has indicated he would be prepared, if necessary, to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia and cling on to occupied Ukrainian land. ""We will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,"" he warned.Image source, BBC/Goktay KoraltanImage caption, Ukrainian troops are doggedly holding on to Bakhmut amid fierce Russian attacksKyiv believes Russia is also seeking to depose the pro-European government in Moldova, where Russian troops are based in the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering Ukraine.Can we say how many Russians have died?Neither Russia nor Ukraine give details of their own losses, so reliable numbers are extremely difficult. But Russians losses have been especially heavy in recent weeks, with several hundred deaths every day on the battlefields of the east.BBC Russian has identified more than 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in the first year of war and suggests the most conservative estimate would be at least double that, with more than 100,000 others wounded or missing.UK defence intelligence believes Russian casualties increased significantly after partial mobilisation, reaching 175-200,000 in total, of whom 40-60,000 were killed.Ukraine revealed at the end of 2022 that 10-13,000 of its soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. That figure cannot be confirmed, but it followed a US estimate of some 100,000 Ukrainians killed or wounded by November. Before Western artillery arrived in the east last summer, Kyiv officials said 100 to 200 troops were dying every day.The UN human rights commissioner says at least 8,006 civilians have died and 13,287 have been wounded in 12 months of war, but the true number is likely to be substantially higher.Has Putin been damaged?President Putin, 70, has sought to distance himself from military failures, but his authority, at least outside Russia, has been shredded and he makes few trips beyond its borders.At home, Russia´s economy on the surface appears to have weathered a series of Western sanctions for now, although its budget deficit has soared and oil and gas revenue has fallen dramatically.Any attempt to gauge his popularity is fraught with difficulty.Dissent in Russia is highly risky, with jail sentences handed out for anyone spreading ""fake news"" about the Russian military. Those opposing Russia´s leadership have either fled or, as with main opposition figure Alexei Navalny, been thrown into prison.Ukraine´s shift to the WestThe seeds of this war were sown in 2013, when Moscow persuaded Ukraine´s pro-Russian leader to scrap a planned pact with the European Union, prompting protests that ultimately brought him down and led to Russia seizing Crimea and staging a land-grab in the east.Four months into Russia´s 2022 invasion, the EU granted Ukraine candidate status and Kyiv is pushing to be accepted as soon as it can.Russia´s long-time leader was also desperate to prevent Ukraine from entering Nato´s orbit, but his attempt to blame the Western defensive alliance for the war is false.Not only did Ukraine reportedly agree before the war a provisional deal with Russia to stay out of Nato but, in March, President Zelensky offered to maintain Ukraine as a non-aligned, non-nuclear state:  ""It´s a truth and it must be recognised.""How will the war end?No end is currently in sight. Ukraine´s position is that Russian troops must pull back beyond Ukraine´s internationally recognised borders for there to be peace. It is backed by two UN resolutions, passed days after the invasion and hours before the first anniversary of the war.By annexing four regions Russia does not even fully control, Vladimir Putin has made it very hard for himself to give them up.There is little prospect for now of a ceasefire or peace talks. Turkey had some success last summer with the UN in mediating a deal on resuming grain exports through the Black Sea but has had no success since. China is looking for a role in securing a political settlement, but its position is probably too close to Russia to be considered an honest broker.Was Nato to blame for the war?Nato member states have increasingly sent Ukraine air defence systems to protect its cities, as well as missile systems, artillery and drones that helped turn the tide against Russia´s invasion.But it is not to blame for the war and has no troops on the ground. Nato´s expansion comes as a response to the Russian threat - Sweden and Finland only applied to join because of the invasion. Blaming Nato´s expansion eastwards is a Russian narrative that has gained some ground in Europe. Before the war, President Putin demanded Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and remove its forces and military infrastructure from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics.In his eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand ""not an inch to the east"", yet did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev referred merely to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany.Mr Gorbachev said later that ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time.Nato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, From May: Sweden and Finland formally submit Nato applicationsWhat are your questions about the war in Ukraine?

Video shows moment Russian fighter jet hits US drone over Black Sea - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jetBy Jonathan Beale & Thomas MackintoshBBC NewsThe US military has released footage of a Russian jet crashing into one of its drones over the Black Sea.The US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Crimea on Tuesday.Russia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events.It was in the Pentagon´s interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events.The BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes, but the released footage lasts for less than a minute. On Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""We remain confident in the facts we´ve conveyed so far."" He said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public. Mr Austin previously described Russia´s actions as dangerous and reckless - and the edited video released appears to back that up. A feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian Su-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches.  In the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft.When the picture returns, a blade of the drone´s propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told the BBC´s US broadcast partner CBS that it was not clear whether the Russian action was deliberate or accidental.But he said this did not matter because the moves were ""completely inappropriate, unsafe and unprofessional"".Surveillance flights would continue over the Black Sea, he said, but there was no need for military escorts, which he said were unnecessary and would put pilots at risk.Russia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud. Moscow appeared to suggest on Tuesday that it had imposed a unilateral no-fly zone over the region as part of its invasion of Ukraine. Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said the drone had ""violated boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation"". But Mr Kirby said the airspace was international and not restricted.What to know about the US-Russia drone rowIn a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was ""unflyable and uncontrollable"", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.Russia´s defence ministry said the drone crashed after a ""sharp manoeuvre"", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.The Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia´s security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said attempts were being made to find and retrieve the remnants of the drone.On Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported.Mr Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, ""their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised"".That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America´s top military general, who said the US has taken ""mitigating measures"" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaDronesUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64975766,16,03,2023,bbc,russia

US arrests two for illegally exporting aviation tech to Russia - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The two men were operating a trading company in RussiaTwo men in the US state of Kansas have been arrested on suspicion of illegally sending aviation technology to Russia. Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, 59, and Douglas Robertson, 55, owned and operated the KanRus Trading Company.The two conspired to skirt US export laws to sell sophisticated aviation equipment to Russia, says the US Department of Justice. If convicted, they face a maximum of 20 years in prison for exporting controlled goods without a licence. They are also charged with conspiracy, falsifying and failing to file electronic export information, and smuggling goods contrary to US law.Prosecutors said the two had since 2020 sought to evade US export laws, misstating the value and end destination of shipments by routing them through third-party countries.Between November 2020 and February 2021, they received avionics equipment for repair in the US, according to the justice department, including a computer processor with a sticker for Russia´s secretive security agency.Mr Buyanovsky and Mr Robertson used a fraudulent invoice to identify the destination for the equipment as Germany, says the justice department. The defendants also illegally sent avionics gear through Armenia and Cyprus to Russia without obtaining the proper licences, it is alleged.The investigation was carried out by a justice department unit dedicated to enforcing sanctions imposed on the Russian government since its invasion of Ukraine.

Biden hails 'rock solid' Nato as Putin blames West for Russia's war - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Putin and Biden´s speeches compared in under a minuteBy Paul KirbyBBC NewsVladimir Putin has sharpened his vitriol towards the West as President Joe Biden, fresh from a visit to Kyiv, praised Western democracy for standing up to naked Russian aggression.In a week heavy with events ahead of Friday´s anniversary of Russia´s Ukraine invasion, Mr Putin spoke first.The West had enabled Nazi Germany, he claimed, and had turned Ukraine into a neo-Nazi regime that was ""anti-Russia"".Hours later Mr Biden said autocrats understood only one word: ""No, no, no!""""Putin thought the world would roll over, he was wrong,"" he said, vowing that Nato was more united than ever. Kyiv stood strong, proud, tall and free and Western support for Ukraine would not fail, he added. Welcoming him to Warsaw´s royal castle, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that by travelling to Kyiv Mr Biden had shown the free world did not fear anything. Nato´s role was to defend and support the free world and Ukraine ""must win this war"".Mr Putin´s speech barely touched on the progress of Russia´s military in Ukraine and there was no indication of how the war might end. The main news involving Russia´s military came from Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who accused the chief of staff and defence minister of trying to destroy his group and starve it of weapons.Image source, AFPImage caption, A Ukrainian mortar crew in action near Bakhmut this weekRussia´s president did announce he was suspending the New Start nuclear arms control treaty signed with the US in 2010. The deal caps nuclear warhead numbers and Nato, and UK leaders have urged him to reconsider.He also declared he had put new ground-based systems on combat duty. He had already threatened last year to use ""all means at our disposal"" to protect Russia and territory it has seized in Ukraine.Truth was an early casualty of Mr Putin´s lengthy speech, at an exhibition centre a stone´s throw from the Kremlin.""They were the ones who started the war... we´re using force to stop it,"" President Putin asserted in his address to both houses of Russia´s parliament. No Western troops have been on the ground in Ukraine, but Russia´s foreign ministry appeared to double down on the claim when it summoned US ambassador Lynne Tracy on Tuesday, saying that Washington should take steps to withdraw ""US-Nato military and equipment"" from Ukraine.President Putin´s speech fact-checkedPutin promotes Russian escalation in annual speechMr Putin has blamed the West and Nato countless times in the past, and he reprised many of his claims from his TV address on the day of the invasion a year ago. He reminded Russians of the war in Iraq and the bombing of Belgrade, but steered clear of Russia´s long and devastating role in the Syrian civil war, its invasion of neighbouring Georgia or landgrab in Crimea.As he spoke there was a deadly reminder of the human cost of Europe´s most deadly invasion since World War Two.Six people died and many more were wounded as Russian shells hit Kherson city, liberated from Russian troops last November. A bus stop, a pharmacy and residential areas were hit in the city centre and local media said a kindergarten was among the buildings that came under attack.In his nightly address on Tuesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia´s attacks ""did not and could not have any military purpose"", and were instead intended to sow ""terror"".He added that Ukrainian forces were maintaining their positions on the front line in eastern Ukraine - where the bulk of the current fighting is taking place - despite facing great pressure. What is the New Start treaty?Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.Each side´s limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world´s nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.President Biden visited Warsaw a day after he had gone to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky, in a highly complex security operation. The Polish president said the visit had sent ""an extremely important political signal, primarily for Ukraine"", but it was also a sign that the free world and the president of the US was with them and did not forget.Mr Biden reserved much of his praise for Mr Zelensky and the Ukrainians who had reclaimed land captured during the first weeks of the war.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Ukrainian officials said civilian were killed in the middle of the street in Kherson as well as in their homes and workplacesBut he also had words of support for Moldova´s pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, over allegations that Russia was plotting to overthrow the current government. President Putin on Tuesday stoked tensions in Moldova by cancelling a 2012 decree that backed Moldova´s sovereignty in solving the future of a breakaway region of Moldova called Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed.President Biden is due to meet leaders of nine countries on Nato´s eastern flank on Wednesday, and he went out of his way to reaffirm American backing for one of the alliance´s key pledges.Under its Article 5, members of Nato pledge to defend any other member that comes under attack. Mr Biden said US commitment both to the alliance and Article 5 was  ""rock solid"".""Every member of Nato knows it and Russia knows it as well - an attack against one is an attack against all.""Italy´s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, followed up Mr Biden´s visit to Kyiv on Tuesday with her first trip to Ukraine. Visiting the towns of Bucha and Irpin, where Russian troops murdered hundreds of civilians, she said Ukrainians could count on Italy: ""We have been with you since the start and we will be until the end.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaAndrzej DudaVladimir PutinWarsawJoe Biden",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64715646,21,02,2023,bbc,russia
Russia country profile - BBC News,"Russia - the largest country on earth - emerged from a decade of post-Soviet economic and political turmoil to seek to reassert itself as a world power.Income from vast natural resources, above all oil and gas, helped Russia overcome the economic collapse of 1998, but the oil price slump of 2014 ended the long run of prosperity. The state-run gas monopoly Gazprom still supplies a large share of Europe´s needs.Vladimir Putin - Russia´s dominant political figure since 2000 - has enhanced his control over state institutions and the media - a process supplemented more recently by an emphasis on fierce nationalism and hostility to the West.This led to his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in an attempt to re-assert Russian control over the neighbouring country. This was the largest conventional war in Europe since World War Two and has been met with widespread international condemnation.Read more country profiles - Profiles by BBC MonitoringRUSSIAN FEDERATION: FACTSCapital: MoscowArea: 17,098,246 sq kmPopulation: 147.1 millionLanguages: Russian, plus regional and local languagesLife expectancy: 66 years (men) 76 years (women)LEADERPresident: Vladimir PutinImage source, Getty ImagesVladimir Putin has been Russia´s dominant political figure since his election as president in 2000, serving two terms and then a four-year stint as prime minister, before resuming the presidency in 2012 and winning re-election in 2018.Since his re-election against only token opposition, Russia´s authorities have further tightened control over the media, thereby muffling an embryonic opposition movement. He has also and adopted a stridently nationalist course and appealed to memories of Soviet-era power to shore up domestic support.The president presents himself as a strong leader who took Russia out of the economic, social and political crisis of the 1990s, and defends Russia´s national interests, particularly against alleged Western hostility. Opponents and critics at home and abroad accuse him of undermining Russia´s institutions, halting democratic development, and entrenching rule by a narrow, wealthy elite.MEDIAImage source, Getty ImagesSince the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 nearly all independent media outlets in Russia have shut down, been forced to close, or have left the country to operate from exile.

"Up to 30,000 Russian casualties claimed in Bakhmut - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Bakhmut has lost most of its pre-war population since the start of the Russian invasionBy Paul AdamsDiplomatic correspondentBetween 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed and wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say.The epic nature of the battle is out of all proportion to Bakhmut´s strategic significance, they add.But after more than six months of grinding, horrific fighting, the future of Bakhmut still hangs in the balance. Since the fighting began, some 90% of its pre-invasion population has fled.This small administrative city in the Donbas is a wasteland of shattered buildings and trees. Even if it falls to Russia - something that could still take time and is not guaranteed - Moscow will, Western officials say, have gained little and lost much.For Ukraine, one official said, the battle for Bakhmut has been ""a unique opportunity to kill a lot of Russians"".Ukraine´s military has also paid a heavy price, although Western officials reject figures cited on Tuesday by Russia´s defence minister.In a statement to a defence meeting, posted on Telegram, Sergei Shoigu said Ukraine had lost 11,000 troops in February alone. ""The Kyiv regime´s indifference towards its own people is astonishing,"" Mr Shoigu claimed, perhaps deliberately flipping Ukraine´s criticism of Moscow´s own human-wave tactics on its head.Western officials say they ""don´t recognise"" Mr Shoigu´s figures. By contrast, they believe the Wagner mercenary group, which has led Russia´s attempt to capture Bakhmut, is running short of manpower and equipment.In the latest in a series of broadsides against the Russian military, Wagner´s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin accused the Russian military of failing to supply the ammunition Wagner needs to take the city. This, Prigozhin argued, was the result of ""ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal"".Whatever happens to Bakhmut - one official said he thought the Russian effort was ""stalling"" - there´s a clear hope among Ukraine´s allies that the battle has wrecked Moscow´s chances of making any further meaningful headway in the near future.One Western official dismissed the battle for Bakhmut as ""quite a small tactical event"" which held no strategic significance ""for either side"".In his remarks posted on Telegram, Sergei Shoigu said the ""liberation of Artyomovsk [the Russian name for Bakhmut] continues,"" and he suggested that it would represent a breakthrough.""The city is an important defensive hub for Ukrainian forces in the Donbas,"" he said. ""Taking control of it will allow… further offensive actions into the Ukrainian military´s defensive lines.""But Western officials said there was currently no sign of any wider Russian offensive. The general in charge of Moscow´s war effort, Valery Gerasimov, they said, was ""under pressure"".""It´s hard to see how he´s going… to regain the initiative,"" This isn´t the first time Kyiv´s Western backers have suggested that Moscow´s campaign has come unstuck. Similar claims were made following Ukraine´s lightning counter-offensives last autumn.But Russia´s territorial gains over the winter have been extremely modest.Meanwhile, Ukraine has been receiving fresh batches of Western military equipment, including tanks and other armoured vehicles, and laying plans for its own offensive, which could come as early as May.

Ukraine: US sanctions Chinese firm helping Russia's Wagner Group - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Wagner is a key partner in Russia´s war effort, sending thousands of mercenary fighters to UkraineBy Kelly NgBBC NewsThe US has sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly providing satellite imagery of Ukraine to support the mercenary Wagner Group´s combat operations for Russia.Changsha Tianyi Space Science and Technology Research Institute is among 16 entities slapped with curbs by the Treasury Department.The firm, also known as Spacety China, has offices in Beijing and Luxembourg.Wagner supplies Russia thousands of fighters in the Ukraine war.Spacety China had provided Terra Tech, a Russia-based technology firm, with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images of locations in Ukraine, the US Treasury Department´s Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement on Thursday.""These images were gathered in order to enable Wagner combat operations in Ukraine,"" it said. The department has also sanctioned Spacety´s Luxembourg-based subsidiary. Under the sanctions, there can be no transfer, payment, or export of any property or interests in the United States to the targeted entities.Spacety China has yet to respond to the move.China, a strategic partner of Russia, has attempted to position itself as a neutral party with regard to the Ukraine war. It has been criticised by the US and its allies for refusing to condemn Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.WATCH: Inside the Wagner groupRussia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarOn its website, Spacety China describes itself as a ""pioneer"" in providing commercial SAR technology and says  it wants to ""make SAR imagery of every point on earth accessible and affordable"" to users all over the world.SAR is a type of radar technology that can deliver higher resolution images using shorter antennas.Its chief executive officer Yang Feng sits on China´s Ministry of Science and Technology´s panel of experts, according to the company´s website.The site also lists a number of working partners including state-owned enterprises China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, as well as the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.Image source, AFPImage caption, On its website, Spacety China describes itself as a ""pioneer"" in providing satellite technologyIn addition to Spacety China, 15 other entities, eight individuals and four aircraft - many of them based in Russia - that allegedly form part of Wagner´s global support network also received US sanctions.These include Sewa Security Services based in central Africa and Kratol Aviation based in the United Arab Emirates, which allegedly provided aircraft to move personnel and equipment between central Africa, Libya and Mali.Wagner now commands some 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, according to estimates from the White House. The organisation plays a key role in Russia´s war efforts, and has been heavily involved in attempts to capture Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine.It is led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""Today´s expanded sanctions on Wagner, as well as new sanctions on their associates and other companies enabling the Russian military complex, will further impede Putin´s ability to arm and equip his war machine,"" said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warChinaRussiaUkraineRussia sanctions",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64421915,27,01,2023,bbc,russia

Russia threatens to destroy Ukraine jets after Poland and Slovakia pledges - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Poland pledged four MiG-29 jets on ThursdayBy Jonathan Beale, Defence correspondent, & Robert GreenallBBC NewsRussia has threatened to destroy any fighter jets given to Ukraine by its allies, after two countries promised planes.Slovakia became the second Nato country to pledge Kyiv some MiG-29 aircraft on Friday, a day after Poland.Slovakia´s fleet was grounded last year and it no longer uses the jets.Ukraine has asked Western countries for modern jets, but because of long training times, these are seen only as long-term options.It sees extra aircraft as important for its defences and possible counter-attacks, a year into Russia´s invasion.Other Nato countries are considering sending planes such as the MiG-29 - a model which dates from the time of the Soviet Union - which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the plans, saying that the aircraft would not affect the outcome of Moscow´s ""special military operation"", as it calls the war.He said they would only ""bring additional woes for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people"".""Of course, during the special military operation, all this equipment will be subject to destruction,"" the spokesman added.The Polish and Slovak pledges are a positive move for Ukraine - which has more pilots than planes - but will not make a decisive difference. The Ukrainians say what they really need is US-made F-16 fighters. Yuri Sak, a senior Ukrainian defence adviser, says the fourth-generation fighters have better capabilities.  It still seems unlikely that Ukraine would get them - at least for now, as it would take time to train Ukrainian pilots on Western jets.Western military officers remain sceptical about modern fighters. Their focus is on helping Ukraine win the battle on the ground. The front lines are swamped with air defence systems on both sides. The Russian air force is much bigger than Ukraine´s and it hasn´t been able to gain control of the skies.At the start of Russia´s full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have about 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing MiG-29s and Su-27s.On Friday, Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger tweeted that his government had approved sending the country´s 13 MiG-29s to Ukraine.He said ""promises must be kept"" and that he was glad others were answering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky´s call for more weapons.It is not clear how many of the Slovakian planes are operational.What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Mr Heger said Slovakia would also send Ukraine part of its Kub air defence system.On Thursday, Poland pledged four MiG-29s, to be sent in the coming days, but more are expected to follow.As with its pledge of Leopard tanks, Poland has broken a barrier. This was a step no-one was prepared to take a year ago.News of the pledges came amid Russian media reports that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had decorated pilots involved in an incident earlier this week .Washington has condemned the Russian actions, in which it says one of the Su-27 jets clipped the drone, as reckless, but Moscow says the drone failed on its own.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jetRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineSlovakiaPoland",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64988504,17,03,2023,bbc,russia
Petrol below £1.50 a litre for first time since Russia invaded Ukraine - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Katy Austin & Faarea MasudTransport correspondentAverage petrol prices have fallen below 150p a litre for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, the AA motoring group says. Pump prices hit 149.74p per litre on Monday, lower than last February and down from a record 191.53p in July.The AA said falling global oil prices were behind the drop, calling it ""a huge relief for drivers"".But it said diesel still cost more than last year at 172.21p a litre compared with 153.05p. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said it now cost about £23 less to fill an average-sized 55-litre car with petrol than it did in July, at roughly £82.However, he said petrol prices were ""still historically way above"" what they should be and that the end of a temporary fuel duty cut this March could lead to fresh rises. Petrol stations in cities and towns are also charging up to 10p more for fuel than those in rural parts of the UK, he added. Filling a diesel car now costs a record £100Petrol prices drop from record highsFuel prices began to rise last year as countries ended Covid lockdowns but surged higher when Russia - a major oil producer - invaded Ukraine, sparking concerns about global supplies. By July last year, the cost of filling an average-sized car had hit £105.29, according to the RAC motoring group, while for diesel it was £109.47.The government has cut fuel duty by 5p a litre since February last year to help drivers, with the overall cut worth 6p when VAT is factored in, the AA says. However, the discount is scheduled to end in March. David Cox, an independent energy analyst, told the BBC that concerns over global oil supplies had subsided as countries had found alternatives to Russian crude, sending prices lower. However, he warned oil prices were likely to rise again as China eased its strict Covid rules and fully reopened its economy. ""I think the outlook [for oil and petrol prices] is it will go back up. We´re in for a prolonged period of higher prices.""Rising electric car costsThe news comes as the RAC said the cost of rapid-charging an electric car using a public charging network had increased by about 50% in the past eight months.It now costs an average of 70.32p per kilowatt hour to rapid charge on a pay-as-you-go basis, up from 44.55p last May and from 63.29p last September, the motoring group said.The rises - which are being driven by increasing energy costs - mean that drivers now pay £36 to charge a typical family-sized electric car with a 64kWh battery to the level required to cover around 188 miles, it said. However, it added that those who charged at home were still getting ""great value"", paying about half as much.  The RAC´s electric vehicles spokesman, Simon Williams, said cutting the level of VAT on electricity sold at public chargers to 5% to match what people pay at home would be one way of keeping prices under control.""It continues to be the case that those who can charge at home or at work and who don´t use the public rapid charging network very often get fantastic value - even given the relatively high domestic energy prices right now. ""Sadly, the same can´t be said for people who either can´t charge at home or at work, or who regularly make longer journeys beyond the range of their cars. There´s no question they have to pay far more, and in some cases more than petrol or diesel drivers do to fill up on a mile-for-mile basis.""Related TopicsCost of livingEfficient energy useFuel",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64222643,10,01,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: Russian reservists fighting with shovels - UK defence ministry - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The MPL-50 is particularly mythologised in Russia, the UK defence ministry said (stock photo)Russian reservists could be using ""shovels"" for ""hand-to-hand"" combat in Ukraine due to a shortage of ammunition, the UK´s Ministry of Defence says.In late February, reservists described being ordered to assault a Ukrainian position ""armed with only ´firearms and shovels´"", the ministry said in its latest intelligence update.It mentioned a shovel known as MPL-50.The tool was designed in 1869 and had changed little, the ministry said.It has been part of the Russian reservist army kit for decades.""The lethality of the standard-issue MPL-50 entrenching tool is particularly mythologised in Russia,"" the ministry said.The continued use of the shovel ""as a weapon highlights the brutal and low-tech fighting which has come to characterise much of the war"", it said.One of the reservists described being ""neither physically nor psychologically"" prepared for the action, the update added.""Recent evidence suggests an increase in close combat in Ukraine,"" it said. ""This is probably a result of the Russian command continuing to insist on offensive action largely consisting of dismounted infantry, with less support from artillery fire because Russia is short of munitions.""The BBC has been unable to independently verify these reports. The ministry did not give information on where such battles were taking place.Analysts say that although there is indeed an ammunition shortage, the situation is more complex than the intelligence update suggests, with Russian forces still using twice as much ammunition as the Ukrainian side.Is Russia’s stock of weapons running low?Meanwhile Russian forces appear to have secured a sufficient positional advantage in the besieged city of Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said.Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take control of the small city, where around 4,000 civilians remain. Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia, but the city´s strategic value has been questioned.The ISW said Russia´s positional advantage could allow a ""turning movement"" in the city. The purpose of a turning movement is to force the enemy to abandon prepared defensive positions, and is different from the aim of an encirclement, which is to trap and destroy enemy forces, the ISW says. ""The Russians may have intended to encircle Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, but the Ukrainian command has signalled that it will likely withdraw rather than risk an encirclement,"" the ISW said.However, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday that it had no intention of withdrawing from Bakhmut.A statement by the Armed Forces General Staff acknowledged that Russian forces were still trying to surround the city, but said more than 100 attacks had been repelled in the eastern Donbas region in the past 24 hours. Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64855760,06,03,2023,bbc,russia

A much-anticipated wave of strikes to mark the first anniversary of Russia´s full scale invasion on 24 February failed to materialise - though this probably said more about media expectations than Russia´s actual strategy. But the increasingly sporadic nature of Russia´s infrastructure attacks is notable.Western officials believe this indicates a shortage of the kind of precision-guided weaponry - especially missiles - needed to carry out such attacks with any measure of effectiveness. ""It takes them that long to get a number of precision weapons together before they can mount a packaged event strike,"" was how one official put it earlier this week. Ukraine´s military has also become quite adept at intercepting incoming missiles and drones.Preliminary data suggests that a significant proportion of the weapons used today were shot down, including more than 70% of the cruise missiles and half the drones. According to Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, another eight missiles were thwarted by what he described as ""organized countermeasures"".But clearly, judging by reports from all over the country, others found their mark. Image source, EPAImage caption, Locals gather around a shelling crater after a rocket hit the Pisochyn neighbourhood outside KharkivSome weapons, like the long range Kh-22 anti-ship missile, which dives steeply onto its target from an extremely high altitude, are hard to intercept. The same goes for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile, which was never designed to attack targets on the ground but which has been increasingly used in this role over the course of the past six months. Military analysts will pore over the latest data, looking for what Russia´s choice of weapons indicates about Moscow´s tactics and remaining stocks. Before today´s attacks, observers had begun to wonder whether Russia would persist with a strategy that doesn´t appear to be working.Ukraine in maps: Russia launches new missile attacksUkraine nuclear plant loses power after strikesDespite the enormous damage inflicted on Ukraine´s power grid over the past six months, the country has not been brought to its knees and most Ukrainians have long since become accustomed to power cuts, inconvenience and the occasional danger.  Ukraine´s engineers have successfully kept power flowing across the country, despite losing scores of transformers, switches and other key components of the country´s infrastructure.In Kyiv and other cities, street lights have recently been switched back on, offering relief to pedestrians used to making their way along darkened pavements with only their mobile phones to light the way.But the situation remains precarious and officials know that Russia is still able to cause immense damage.

"Beth Matthews: Blogger bought substance from Russia, inquest hears - BBC News","Image source, Family handoutImage caption, Beth Matthews, from Cornwall, was a well-known mental health bloggerBy Angus CrawfordBBC NewsMental health blogger Beth Matthews bought the poisonous substance she ingested from Russia, an inquest has heard.While on a secure ward she was able to frequently visit a website that discussed suicide methods, jurors were told.Ms Matthews, 26, from Cornwall, ordered the substance while at Priory Hospital Cheadle Royal near Stockport in March.She was being treated as an NHS patient at the hospital, run by Priory Group.The court heard from police coroners officer Claire Smith, who described how she had received a download of information from Ms Matthews´ phone which ran to 100,000 pages.Ms Smith found she had frequently accessed a website with thousands of threads discussing suicide and methods.One method involved swallowing a poisonous substance which Ms Matthews ""had attempted to purchase from a number of sources"". The officer found Ms Matthews, who had tens of thousands of followers and was described as ""bright and vivacious"", had bought the substance three weeks before her death from a supplier in Russia, which was shipped by airmail through Heathrow.Blogger ´restrained´ before swallowing substanceBlogger told staff about buying substance - inquestBlogger´s parcel should have been checked - inquestThe jury was told there was no means of controlling patient access to the internet via their mobile phones.Alerts had been issued by the Priory about the poisonous substance used by Ms Matthews in 2018 and again in 2020.If you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line.Assistant Coroner Andrew Bridgman said it was ""surprising that none of the staff knew anything about it"".A friend of Ms Matthews, Sarah Page, also gave evidence.She described receiving a message from Ms Matthews on the day she died which read ""I´ve taken poison, I´ll be dead in an hour"".She did not get the message until later that afternoon.Ms Page said she thought the Priory ""was a place of safety"" and said her friend´s death ""need not have taken place"".The inquest continues.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Bakhmut: Fighting in the street but Russia not in control - deputy mayor - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Bakhmut has lost 95% of its pre-war population since the start of the Russian invasionBy James Landale in Kyiv and Laura Gozzi in LondonBBC NewsRussian and Ukrainian forces are fighting in the streets of Bakhmut - but Russia does not control the eastern city, its deputy mayor has said.Oleksandr Marchenko also told the BBC the remaining 4,000 civilians are living in shelters without access to gas, electricity or water. Mr Marchenko said ""not a single building"" had remained untouched and that the city is ""almost destroyed"".Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take charge.""There is fighting near the city and there are also street fights,"" Mr Marchenko said. Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia. But despite that, the city´s strategic value has been questioned. Some experts say any Russian victory could be pyrrhic - that is, not worth the cost.Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000. Ukrainian commanders estimate that Russia has lost seven times as many soldiers as they have.On Saturday, UK military intelligence said Russian advances in the northern suburbs had left the Ukraine-held sections vulnerable to Russian attacks on three sides. Mr Marchenko accused the Russians of having ""no goal"" to save the city and that it wanted to commit ""genocide of the Ukrainian people"". ""Currently there is no communication in the city so the city is cut out, the bridges are destroyed and the tactics the Russians are using is the tactic of parched land,"" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.The fall of Bakhmut has long been predicted, but for more than six months it hasn´t happened. So any reports of potential Ukrainian withdrawal should be treated with caution. It is hard to know what is going on without independent sources. Both sides have a greater incentive to confuse their enemy than provide accurate information. But it may be that Ukrainian commanders are beginning to calculate that the cost of defending Bakhmut - in terms of blood and treasure - is now too great, despite the grievous losses being inflicted on Russian troops. And if so, then they might want what Western analysts call ""a controlled fighting withdrawal"" to protect the remaining Ukrainian forces so they can be redeployed. But any withdrawal may be hard fought and could take some time. Earlier this week, Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the situation in the area was becoming ""more and more difficult"" - although the Ukrainian military said it had repelled numerous attacks since Friday. ""I believe we shouldn´t give any inch of our land to the enemy,"" Mr Marchenko said. ""We should protect our land, we should protect our people and we should protect the businesses that are on this land.""The city was ""almost destroyed"", with bridges ruined and communication cut off, Mr Marchenko added.""They want to destroy Bakhmut, they want to destroy the city like they did with Mariupol and Popasna,"" he said, referring to two cities in the east of Ukraine now under Russian control.The Russian military laid siege to the south-eastern port city of Mariupol at the outset of the invasion and took control after three months of artillery bombardment that killed thousands.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A maternity and children´s hospital in Mariupol was hit by a Russian air strike in March 2022Russia claimed the Donbas town of Soledar, about 10km (6.2 miles) from Bakhmut, in January following a long battle with the Ukrainian forces.Soledar, too, was reportedly reduced to a wasteland of flattened buildings and rubble by the time the Ukrainian army retreated.On Friday, President Zelensky stressed that artillery and shells were needed to ""stop Russia"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the country´s latest package included high-precision Himars artillery rockets and howitzers ""which Ukraine is using so effectively"".

Ukraine war: Serbia uproar over Wagner mercenaries recruiting for Russia - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, The Wagner group´s death´s-head mural appeared on a wall in Belgrade signed by an extremist groupBy Guy DelauneyBBC News, Balkans correspondentA Russian news video claiming to show Serbian volunteers training to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine has prompted outrage in Serbia, exposing its complex relationship with Moscow.Russia´s Wagner mercenary group made the Serbian-language videos to encourage recruitment for the war.Serbia´s president, Aleksandar Vucic, reacted angrily on national TV.""Why do you, from Wagner, call anyone from Serbia when you know that it is against our rules?"" he said.Critics frequently accuse Serbia of prioritising its long-standing friendship with Russia over its ambition to join the EU. But what has emerged in recent days in Belgrade shows that the picture is not so black and white.Hinting at less-than-rosy relations with Moscow, President Vucic said that not only was Serbia ""neutral"" regarding the war in Ukraine, but that he had not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin for ""many months"".It is illegal for Serbs to take part in conflicts abroad. What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Tanzanian killed in Ukraine: We told him not to goRussia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarThe number of Serbian recruits involved does not appear be significant. Some did fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine in 2014, but not with any sort of official endorsement. In fact, Serbian courts convicted more than two dozen people for taking part in ""fighting on foreign battlefronts"".On Thursday, a Belgrade-based lawyer and anti-war groups filed criminal complaints against the Russian ambassador as well as the head of Serbia´s state security and information agency (BIA) for allegedly recruiting Serbs for the Wagner group.In Belgrade, where provocative murals are numbingly common, the Wagner death´s head emblem appeared on a city-centre wall last week. It was signed by the People´s Patrols, an extreme right-wing organisation which has previously staged sparsely attended pro-Russia rallies. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Serbia´s president Aleksandar Vucic made clear this week that his country´s trajectory was towards the WestNone of the mainstream political parties have even hinted at support for the invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, Serbia has consistently voted in favour of resolutions at the United Nations condemning Russia´s aggression. President Vucic this week made Belgrade´s position crystal clear: ""For us, Crimea is Ukraine, Donbas is Ukraine, and it will remain so."" The US expressed concerns to the Serbian leader last week about Wagner´s recruitment efforts, and US ambassador Christopher Hill said this week he was glad to hear that President Vucic could see ""the threat to peace and stability posed by Wagner potentially operating in Serbia"". But Mr Vucic´s stance has not been enough to impress the European Parliament, because Serbia has repeatedly refused to impose sanctions on Russia. For the second time, MEPs have passed a resolution calling for the suspension of membership negotiations until Serbia agrees to sanctions.For as long as the EU showed little enthusiasm for expanding the bloc to include the countries of the Western Balkans, it made sense for Serbia to maintain friendly ties with Moscow. It reminded Brussels that Belgrade had other options. Cheap gas supplies, Gazprom´s majority ownership of Serbia´s oil company NIS and Russia´s refusal to recognise Kosovo´s independence were practical reasons to stay on good terms.But the invasion of Ukraine has shifted perceptions. Belgrade was not impressed when President Putin referred to Kosovo´s unilateral declaration of independence as justification for recognising the independence of areas of occupied eastern Ukraine.Meanwhile, Brussels belatedly realised that its reticence towards the Western Balkans was leaving room for Moscow to meddle. Accession talks for Albania and North Macedonia were swiftly unblocked - and Bosnia received candidate status. So if Serbia´s president has been waiting for a moment to pivot decisively to the West, it might just have arrived. He has been warning of ""very difficult"" conversations with EU and US special envoys - and says he will address Serbs over the weekend to tell them ""what is required and expected from Serbia regarding Kosovo and sanctions against Russia"".Mr Vucic has made similar remarks before - without ever committing to a major policy change. But this week he once again reiterated that Serbia´s trajectory was towards the West.""I know that EU is our path,"" he told Bloomberg News. ""There are no other paths.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSerbiaRussiaBelgrade",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64329371,19,01,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: Auschwitz anniversary marked without Russia - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, The director of the museum Piotr Cywinski spoke out against the Ukraine war in his speech at the eventBy Adam Easton in Warsaw & Jasmine Andersson in LondonBBC NewsFor the first time a Russian delegation was not invited to a ceremony marking the liberation of the former Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp in modern-day Poland. Russia is usually represented at the event, as the camp in occupied Poland was liberated by the Soviet Army.But this year, following Moscow´s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum declined to invite Russian officials and its director likened the Ukraine war to the horrors of the Holocaust.In response, Russia accused the museum of attempting to ""rewrite history"". At the event on Friday, museum director Piotr Cywinski said Auschwitz was created by Nazi ""megalomania"" and a ""similar sick megalomania"" and ""similar lust for power"" had driven Russia´s destruction of Mariupol and Donetsk. Speaking to an audience including camp survivors, he warned that ""once again, innocent people are being killed en masse in Europe"".""Russia, unable to conquer Ukraine, has decided to destroy it. We see it every day, even as we stand here. And so it is difficult to stand here today.""Reacting to the decision, Russia said Soviet soldiers who freed Auschwitz would not be forgotten. ""No matter how our European ´non-partners´ contrived in their attempts to rewrite history in a new way, the memory of the Soviet heroes-liberators and horrors of Nazism cannot be erased,"" Russia´s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in a pointed social media post.Auschwitz survivors also expressed their fears over the fallout of the war in Ukraine at the event.Polish survivor Zdzislawa Wlodarczyk said she was ""scared to hear what is happening in the East"".She told the audience that she had arrived in Auschwitz as an 11-year-old following the Warsaw Uprising, a failed attempt by the Polish resistance in 1944 to liberate the city from the German occupiers.She and her 7-year-old brother remained in the camp until the Soviet army liberated it.""The Russian armies that liberated us are now waging war on Ukraine. Why? Why? That´s what politics is,"" she said.The Polish nation has stood firm in its support for Ukraine during the conflict, with Poles housing hundreds of thousands of refugees in their own homes and offering military support to its neighbour.Russian officials have taken part in their own commemorative events, with Vladimir Putin meeting Russia´s top rabbis on the eve of the remembrance day on Thursday.The Russian leader said he was ""pursuing a policy meaning nothing like this in the history of mankind will ever happen again"".Russia´s Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar has spoken about his regret that Russia has been excluded from the commemoration, warning that ""these political games have no place on Holocaust day"".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar attends a candle lighting ceremony at the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Centre in MoscowHe told AFP: ""For us, this is clearly a humiliation because we perfectly know and remember the role of the Red [Soviet] Army in the liberation of Auschwitz and in the victory over Nazism.""Friday´s event marks the 78th anniversary of the Soviet army liberating the concentration and extermination camp in German-occupied Poland, where more than one million people were murdered by the Nazis. Auschwitz-Birkenau was created as a part of the Holocaust, a process that started with discrimination against Jewish people, and ended with six million Jews being killed because of who they were.In total, 1.1 million people died in the camp, around one million Jews from across Europe as well as Poles, Soviet POWs, Roma and Sinti.

Ukraine war: What support is China giving Russia? - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Presidents Putin and Xi met in February and discussed boosting tiesBy Reality CheckBBC NewsChina has become an increasingly important trading partner for Russia as it seeks to soften the impact of economic sanctions imposed by some countries in response to its invasion of Ukraine.  The United States now says Beijing is considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, allegations which China strongly denies.Is China providing Russia with weapons?China has been expanding its military production capabilities and is now the world´s fourth largest arms exporter.""China´s weapons are getting more advanced now,"" says Siemon Wezeman from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. ""Its drones, for example, are one area that Russia would be very interested in.""The US says Chinese firms have already provided ""non-lethal support"" to Russia, and that it has new information suggesting Beijing could soon provide ""lethal support"".Maria Shagina, an expert in economic sanctions at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, says China has not overtly supplied Russia with weapons but may be secretly selling it hi-tech products which could be used for military purposes.""There is evidence that China is the biggest exporter of semiconductors - often through shell companies in Hong Kong and the UAE - to Russia,"" she says.""Some Chinese companies are also supplying civilian drones, exploiting the grey space between military and civilian purposes.""The US-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies says Chinese companies may be sending Russia electronic parts for anti-aircraft missile radars. The US has also imposed sanctions on a Chinese company which Washington says has provided satellite imagery in support of Russian mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine. US sanctions Chinese firm helping Russia´s WagnerWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Russia´s most important trading partnerAfter Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Western nations imposed strict sanctions on Russia - banning imports of oil and exports of hi-tech products.Many Western firms cut their connections with Russia entirely, and its trade with the US, UK, and EU countries slumped over the course of 2022.However, China´s overall trade with Russia hit a record high level of $190bn in 2022 - a 30% increase on the year before.Russian imports from China increased 13% to $76bn and its exports to China increased by 43% to $114bn.As Russia´s trade with Western countries plunged in 2022, China became, by far and away, its most important trading partner.How much oil and gas is China buying from Russia?  Almost half of all the Russian government´s annual revenues come from oil and gas, and its sales to EU countries has plummeted over the past year as sanctions bite.  A significant amount of this shortfall has been made up with increased sales to Asia.Who is buying Russian oil and gasRussia exported twice as much liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to China in 2022 than it did the year before. It also delivered 50% more natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline, and 10% more crude oil. The G7 group of economically developed countries, along with the European Union and Australia, has tried to impose a worldwide cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea, but China has refused to comply and buys Russian crude at market prices.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s terminal in Tianjin receives liquified natural gas from RussiaThere are also longer term plans to expand energy ties.

Russia and Ukraine extend grain deal despite disagreement - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, The UN says nearly 25 million tonnes of grain have left Ukraine under the dealBy Sarah FowlerBBC NewsA deal allowing Ukraine to export millions of tonnes of grain through the Black Sea despite the ongoing conflict with Russia has been extended.But it is unclear how long it will last, with Ukraine pushing for 120 days, and Russia calling for 60 days.Russia has warned it will not allow the deal to go on longer unless sanctions against Moscow are softened.The UN and Turkey helped broker the export agreement last July following fears of a global food crisis. Ukraine is one of the world´s top producers of grain, but its access to ports in the Black Sea was blocked by Russian warships following the invasion in February last year.Countries that suffer with food insecurity, such as Yemen, rely heavily on these supplies. What is the Ukraine grain deal and is it working?Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced an agreement on extending the deal on Saturday, with hours to go before it was due to expire.""This deal is of vital importance for the global food supply. I thank Russia and Ukraine, who didn´t spare their efforts for a new extension, as well as the United Nations secretary general,"" he said.But neither Mr Erdogan nor the UN clarified how long it would last. Ukraine wanted it to be extended for 120 days, but Russia said it was only willing to renew the pact for another 60 days.Vassily Nebenzia, Russia´s ambassador to the UN, said on Friday that the EU, UK and US had two months to remove any sanctions targeting Russia´s agricultural sector if they wanted the deal to continue.Moscow wants Russian producers to be able to export more food and fertiliser to the rest of the world, but says Western sanctions are preventing them.While food and fertiliser exports have not been targeted, Russia says restrictions on payments, insurers and shippers makes exports difficult.Russia briefly withdrew from the deal in November last year, accusing Ukraine of attacking its fleet in the Crimea - but it re-joined a few days later.According to the UN, the deal has already allowed nearly 25 million tonnes of foodstuffs from Ukraine´s Black Sea ports reach global markets.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warTurkeyFood",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65000324,18,03,2023,bbc,russia

Aliksandr Azarov, leader of Belarusian anti-government organisation BYPOL, claimed responsibility for the attack on Telegram.The Beriev A-50 early warning aircraft was struck by multiple blasts near the Machulishchy airbase.It comes amid increased cooperation between Minsk and Moscow. The strikes damaged front and central parts of the aircraft as well as its radar and antenna, BYPOL said on Telegram.""These were drones. The participants of the operation are Belarusian"", Mr Azarov said.Speaking to the BBC, Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader, said the attack was ""creative"" and ""sophisticated"".""It was very brave because Belarusians are in a situation of the total terror"", he told BBC News. He added that the opposition party was ""definitely helped by locals, helped by military"" to cause damage to the plane.However, it is not possible to confirm the opposition´s account of what happened. Belarus leader: We´ll join Russia in war if attackedBelarus country profile Both the Russian and Belarusian departments of defence are yet to publicly comment on the incident. Separately, a prominent pro-Kremlin channel, Tsargrad TV, confirmed a drone attack on the airbase, but blamed it on the Ukrainian military. It also reported damage to the A-50, but did not give specific details.A Russian air defence expert, Yuri Knutov, told the channel that for some reason the airbase had not been protected by Russian Pantsir anti-aircraft missiles. He described the A-50 as an airborne command centre used for directing Russian air strikes.BYPOL, the Belarusian group that has claimed responsibility for the strike on the aircraft, consists of former law enforcement officers now opposed to President Alexander Lukashenko´s office. It has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Mr Lukashenko´s government. While Belarus has not directly become involved in the war in Ukraine, Mr Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to launch into Ukraine through Belarus.The two countries have also been participating in joint military training exercises over recent months.

Ukraine war: Russia's Wagner casts doubt on brutal death of 'traitor' - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Grey Zone/TelegramImage caption, Yakushchenko was first shown in Ukrainian captivity before his apparent death at the hands of WagnerRussia´s Wagner mercenary group has cast doubt on a video appearing to show the brutal killing of a Wagner soldier for defecting to the Ukrainians.In a new video clip, released by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, the soldier says, ""I was forgiven.""And in a post on his Telegram channel, Mr Prigozhin calls the soldier, Dmitry Yakushchenko, ""a fine fellow"".Wagner may have faked the earlier video. It appeared to show Yakushchenko being hit fatally with a sledgehammer.Mr Prigozhin joked about that video in reply to an inquiry from Russian news outlet Ostorozhno Media about Yakushchenko´s true fate.""Ksenia, don´t treat everything so gloomily. The kids are having fun,"" the Wagner chief wrote enigmatically. He said the case was not a one-off drama, but more like the hit Soviet-era TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring, a thriller set in World War Two. ""You know, good always triumphs over evil,"" he added.Yakushchenko´s current circumstances are unclear - and there is no confirmation that he is still alive, despite Mr Prigozhin´s message on Telegram. Yakushchenko may have returned to Wagner via a prisoner exchange, but that has not been confirmed. In the first video on Monday, released on the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone, he admitted having fled to the Ukrainian side, before being kidnapped and ending up as a prisoner of Wagner.The apparent sledgehammer ""execution"", filmed in a cellar, was presented as the ""trial of a traitor"". It was similar to a brutal killing shown in a Wagner video three months ago, again involving a soldier accused of defecting to the Ukrainians.Wagner calls itself a ""private military company"" (PMC) and has thousands of troops involved in heavy fighting in Ukraine.It began operations in 2014 in Crimea and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of brutality and war crimes.In the second video on Monday, Yakushchenko said: ""In Wagner PMC, everyone has the right to correct their mistakes. ""When I was captured, I said all sorts of garbage and I´m still ashamed, but it was the only way to survive. Upon return from captivity, I brought lots of valuable information that saved the lives of many guys, so I was forgiven, for which I am very grateful.""Neither video indicated where or when the filming took place, nor was that clear from the accompanying text posts.Warning: you may find the description below upsettingGrey Zone named the alleged ""traitor"" as Crimea-born Dmitry Yakushchenko, 44, who defected to Ukraine four days after becoming a Wagner fighter.The first part of the video showed him in Ukrainian captivity - the BBC has established that the clip came from Ukrainian channel Espreso.TV. In it, Yakushchenko suggested that Crimea might return to Ukraine´s control in a couple of years.According to the text, he had been jailed earlier for murder, but had seized the chance to fight for Wagner in order to leave jail. Wagner is known to have recruited men from Russian prisons.The video then cuts to a shot of Yakushchenko sitting in a cellar with his head taped to construction debris set against a stone wall. Another man is standing behind him holding a sledgehammer. A caption calls the scene ""trial for treachery"".At the point where the first hammer blow is struck, the video goes blurred and Yakushchenko falls backwards. Further blows are struck, then a caption reads ""the court session is adjourned"".Image source, AFPImage caption, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin rose to prominence as head of a catering businessThe Grey Zone post makes a sarcastic comment about Yakushchenko´s apparent death, referring back to Wagner´s November ""execution"" of Yevgeny Nuzhin, who was also a former prison inmate. ""Like his colleague Yevgeny Nuzhin earlier, he caught the same disease that makes you lose consciousness in Ukrainian cities, earlier in Kyiv, now in Dnipro, and then wake up in a basement at your last court session,"" the post said.In depth: War in UkrainePowerful ´Putin´s chef´ cooks up murky dealsThe shadowy mercenary group has adopted a more public profile since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago - even opening a big headquarters in St Petersburg. Yevgeny Prigozhin, for years a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has been nicknamed ""Putin´s chef"" for providing catering services for the Russian elite and armed forces. But he has given Wagner credit for the offensive on Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, downplaying the Russian army´s role, and suggesting that his forces are more competent fighters.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64626783,13,02,2023,bbc,russia
Russia to cut oil production over price caps - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesRussia will reduce crude oil production by 500,000 barrels per day from March after major economies imposed a price cap on oil products. Oil prices rose after Russia´s deputy prime minister Alexander Novak announced the cut. The European Union, G7 nations and Australia have capped how much they will pay for oil and refined products.These are part of western sanctions designed to put pressure on Russia over its war in Ukraine.Russia is one of the largest oil producers in the world. Its planned cuts sent the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, up by 2.2% to $86 per barrel.Western countries have been introducing tougher oil sanctions on Russia as its invasion of Ukraine continues, as part of efforts to limit the Kremlin´s gain from sales and reduce its ability to finance the war.Most recently, an EU ban on seaborne imports from Russia of refined oil products, such as diesel, came into force this week. Traders who do not comply with these sanctions have access to tanker fleets and insurance markets restricted.In the case of the oil price cap, countries stopped the use of Western-supplied maritime insurance, finance and brokering for seaborne Russian oil priced above $60 per barrel from 5 December.In response, Russia has banned any deals involving the cap. Mr Novak said: ""As of today, we are fully selling the entire volume of oil produced, however, as stated earlier, we will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the principles of the ´price cap´.""In this regard, Russia will voluntarily reduce production by 500,000 barrels per day in March. This will contribute to the restoration of market relations.""So far, according to Mr Novak, Russia has been able to find buyers for all of its output, despite the sanctions.Industry sources told the BBC that hundreds of tankers have been acquired by companies in recent weeks, creating a so-called ""dark fleet"" prepared to carry Russian crude at higher prices. The last big fall in Russian oil output was in April last year, when it collapsed by nearly 9% following the introduction of Western sanctions over Ukraine.But since then, Russia has managed to set up logistics chains for its oil sales, mostly in Asia. Last year, Russian oil production rose by 2% to 10.7 million barrels per day.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaOilFuel",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64594715,10,02,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: UN accuses Russia of breaking child protection rules over refugees - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Filippo Grandi has been on a six-day visit to Ukraine to assess the situationBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsThe head of the United Nations´ refugee agency has accused Moscow of violating ""fundamental"" child protection principles by giving Russian passports to unaccompanied child refugees.Filippo Grandi added that Russia had then been putting these children up for adoption by Russian families. He said the UNHCR would try to get access to those affected and try to find solutions in their best interest.However, Mr Grandi admitted he did not know how many children were affected. ""In the situation of war, you cannot determine if children have families or guardianship. And therefore, until that is clarified, you cannot give them another nationality or having them adopted by another family,"" Mr Grandi said.According to the most recent UNHCR data, nearly three million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded in Russia - more than in any other European country. It is unclear how many of these are children. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said earlier this month almost 14,000 children had been ""deported"" to Russia from occupied parts of Ukraine, and accused it of kidnapping them. The Kremlin has denied the allegations.  Mr Grandi has said the UNHCR is seeking access to Russia ""all the time"" but that so far this has been ""rare, sporadic and not unfettered"".His comments come after the United Nations´ top rights official expressed concern in July that Ukrainian children had been taken from orphanages in the eastern Donbas region and ""forcibly deported"" to Russia. There was also concern Moscow was ""modifying existing legislation"" to fast-track this process. Michelle Bachelet said at the time that she could not confirm the allegations or the number of children potentially affected. Then in September, the assistant UN secretary-general for human rights said there were ""credible allegations"" of ""forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian occupied territory, or to the Russian Federation itself"".Mr Grandi was speaking at the end of a six-day visit to Ukraine and told local residents that ""the whole world admires you because you are strong people.""He said it was possible more refugees could return to Ukraine in the summer, as happened last year, but warned that more fighting could lead to greater displacement, especially internally.Mr Grandi also painted a bleak global outlook when it came to refugees - predicting the number of displaced people would ""almost inevitably"" grow from the current figure of around 103 million in the coming years.Related TopicsRussiaRefugees and asylum seekersUkraineUkrainian refugees",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64429377,27,01,2023,bbc,russia
Putin promotes Russian escalation in annual speech - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ShuttershockImage caption, Vladimir Putin has said Russia is ready to resume nuclear weapons testing during his annual state of the nation addressBy Steve RosenbergRussia editor, MoscowEscalation. It´s become President Putin´s watchword.And we saw more of it today.""Russia suspends its participation in the New Start treaty,"" announced the Kremlin leader in his state of the nation address. As usual he blamed the West.New Start is the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America. It limits the nuclear arsenals of the two countries. But there was more. The Russian president announced that he had signed a decree on ""putting new ground-based strategic complexes on combat standby duty"". He warned that Russia was ready to resume nuclear weapons testing.""Of course, we will not do it first,"" President Putin added. ""But if the US conducts tests, we will do it as well.""New Start had been in trouble. Last month Washington had accused Moscow of violating the agreement by refusing to allow inspection activities on its territory. Moscow´s suspension of its participation in the treaty raises the stakes.""This is more about nuclear blackmail, but it is extremely dangerous,"" believes Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""because we cannot predict how Putin will behave in the future and what is in his mind.""In order to avoid nuclear war, it´s better to have a framework,"" he added.""By losing this framework we are witnessing the real threat of a nuclear war.""What is the New Start treaty?Image source, AFPImage caption, A Russian RS-24 Yars strategic nuclear missileSigned in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.Each side´s limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world´s nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.We´re also witnessing a Kremlin leader who expresses no remorse or regret for his decision to invade Ukraine. His ""special military operation"" has not gone at all according to plan, bringing misery to Ukraine, heavy military casualties for Russia and forcing President Putin to draft hundreds of thousands of Russians into the army. So, was the invasion a huge mistake? A giant miscalculation? You won´t hear Putin admit to one of those. He continues to push the false narrative that the West is to blame for the war.""I want to repeat,"" he said. ""They [the West] started the war. And we used force and are using force to stop it.""""The Western elites do not conceal their goals to bring Russia a strategic defeat. What does it mean? It means to end us, once and for all. It means they plan to turn a local conflict into a global confrontation. We understand it exactly like that. We will react to it accordingly. This is because in this case it is about the very existence of our country."" President Putin exuded confidence that Russia could survive international sanctions and - despite Western support for Ukraine - emerge victorious. No hint of compromise. No sign he´s looking for an off-ramp.""He thinks he has reserves for continuing the war and confrontation. It´s a bad sign,"" Mr Kolesnikov concludes."" He has disrupted any connection with Western countries. He is not ready to finish this disaster right now. He will continue.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaVladimir PutinUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64720695,21,02,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: Russia's Wagner Group commander requests Norway asylum - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Gulagu.netImage caption, Andrey Medvedev in uniform before defecting from WagnerBy Matt MurphyBBC NewsA former commander with the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group has claimed asylum in Norway after deserting from the mercenary outfit. Andrey Medvedev, 26, crossed the border into Norway last Friday, where he was detained by border guards. He is currently being held in the Oslo area where he faces charges of illegal entry to Norway, his lawyer Brynjulf Risnes told the BBC.Mr Risnes said his client left Wagner after witnessing war crimes in Ukraine. The Norwegian Border Guard confirmed to the BBC that a Russian man had been detained after crossing the country´s 198km (123 mile) long border with Russia, but said it could not comment further for ""reasons of security and privacy"". Tarjei Sirma-Tellefsen, police chief of staff in the Norwegian region of Finnmark, said a man had been detained by a border patrol and said he had applied for asylum. But the Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, who helped Mr Medvedev leave Russia, confirmed his identity. His escape is believed to be the first known instance of one of the group´s soldiers defecting to the West. Gulagu.net´s founder Vladimir Osechkin told the BBC that Mr Medvedev had joined the paramilitary group in July 2022 on a four-month contract, but had deserted after witnessing a host of human rights abuses and war crimes while serving in Ukraine. He said that Mr Medvedev is a former soldier in the Russian army and that he later served time in prison between 2017 and 2018 before joining the Wagner Group. He was placed in charge of a Wagner division in Ukraine, where the mercenary group supplied him with around 30-40 troops every week, Mr Osechkin said. In a video posted by Gulagu.net to its social media channels, Mr Medvedev said he fled Ukraine in November after being informed that the group intended to extend his contract indefinitely.What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Ukraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forcesAfter spending two months underground in Russia, he crossed the border into Norway last week. Mr Risnes said his client had also witnessed a host of war crimes while fighting in Ukraine, including seeing ""deserters being executed"" by the Wagner Group´s internal security service. ""In short he felt betrayed and wanted to leave as soon as possible,"" Mr Risnes said. He added that he believed Mr Medvedev had taken some evidence of war crimes with him to Norway and that he intends to share his information with groups investigating war crimes in the coming weeks. In response, the founder of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, appeared to laugh off the allegations.In a press release from one of his companies, Prigozhin issued a sarcastic statement, linking Mr Medvedev to a non-existent Nordic mercenary unit and said he was a Norwegian citizen, in an apparent attempt to mock the man´s testimony.Prigozhin also accused him of ""mistreatment of prisoners"" and said that his former employee was ""very dangerous"". Mr Risnes told the BBC that the Wagner leader´s claims were not true. UK officials believe the Wagner Group makes up about 10% of Russia´s forces in Ukraine, and played a significant part in helping Moscow´s forces take the town of Soledar in eastern Donbas region last week. Thousands of its troops have been recruited from Russian prisons. Mr Prigozhin - a former convict himself - has promised recruits their freedom in exchange for six months service in Ukraine. Before the invasion of Ukraine, it had only a few thousand mercenaries. Most were believed to be experienced former soldiers, including some from Russia´s elite regiments and special forces.Since 2015, it is believed to have deployed troops to Syria, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic.

Russia's economy shrinks by less than expected - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesBy Beth Timmins & Ben KingBusiness reporters, BBC NewsRussia´s economy shrank last year by less than had been expected given its invasion of Ukraine, figures suggest.The economy contracted by 2.1%, according to the country´s statistics agency, but this was less than an earlier prediction of a 12% fall.While questions have been raised about the reliability of the data, many commentators have been surprised at the Russian economy´s resilience.High oil prices and military spending have helped to support the economy.After the invasion, hundreds of Western firms withdrew from Russia. The initial shock forced the stock market in Russia to close temporarily and saw the rouble tumble as people queued up at cash machines. The Institute for International Finance had predicted the Russian economy would shrink by 15% in 2022 and last March, US President Joe Biden said it was ""on track to be cut in half"". What support is China giving Russia? However, for most of 2022, Russia was able to continue exporting energy.Western limits to energy exports were only applied gradually during the year, and while imports to Europe fell sharply during the year, a steady stream of buyers in China, India and elsewhere stepped in to buy up the oil which Europe would not. Rising global prices for oil, gas, petroleum products and other Russian exports, including food and fertilizers, helped to boost Russia´s export revenues.While hundreds of Western companies withdrew from Russia, local entrepreneurs picked up the slack. After McDonald´s sold its restaurants there, for instance, the new owner reopened them in June under a new name ""Vkusno i Tochka"", meaning ""Tasty and That´s It.""Although manufacturing and retail trade were some of the sectors which saw a decline in 2022, agriculture, construction and hospitality all grew, according to Russia´s federal statistics service.Producing equipment for Russia´s armed forces has also kept the country´s factories busy, boosting the economy by making weapons instead of cars. Military security and public administration expanded by 4.1% last year.The sanctions imposed have also been far from watertight. Despite attempts to isolate Russia from the Western financial system, traders have found ways to get money into and out of Russia, through barter, routing transactions through countries which are not taking part in sanctions, or even using cryptocurrencies.  That is not to say that sanctions have not made a significant dent - and some of the impact will be long term. Difficulty getting high-tech imports such as microchips will hold back manufacturing. Experts expect output from oil and gas fields to decline over time without investment, know-how and equipment from the West. The Russian government is predicting that the economy will shrink by 0.8%, but the International Monetary Fund reckons it will grow by 0.3%, partly because of the strength of its exports.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaGDPEconomic growthJoe Biden",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64708832,20,02,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: Russia fires hypersonic missiles in new barrage - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across UkraineBy Henri AstierBBC NewsAt least nine people have died in a new wave of strikes across Ukraine in which Russia used powerful weapons, including rare hypersonic missiles.Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe´s biggest - although it was later restored.On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: ""High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine´s military infrastructure.""It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.""This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,"" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. ""It was like never before.""President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia´s investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.How risky is stand-off over Ukraine´s nuclear plant?Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaNuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.Electricity is needed for cooling radioactive material present at the plant. ""Today´s loss of all external power once again demonstrated how fragile and dangerous the situation is for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,"" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Earlier on Thursday he had called for an international commitment to protect the plant, following a series of strikes since the invasion began.""Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,"" Mr Grossi said.In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts.A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.Elsewhere, Ukraine´s military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.""The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,"" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. ""Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.""Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivRussiaZaporizhzhia nuclear power plantUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64903202,09,03,2023,bbc,russia
Russia sanctions: What impact have they had on its oil and gas exports? - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesBy Jake Horton & Daniele PalumboBBC Reality CheckSince Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow´s revenues and hinder its war effort.The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult.What sanctions are in place?EU nations have ended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined products with effect from 5 December. Image source, ReutersImage caption, European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gasAn oil price cap approved by Western allies in December also aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (£48) for a barrel of crude oil.Russia´s gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it would cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether.Have the sanctions been effective?Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia´s north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations.The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea.The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world´s major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere.""Moscow is losing out on about $175m (£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from RussiaMajor Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift.Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies.Who is buying Russian oil?India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea.And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India´s oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier.China´s imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year.In 2021, more than half of all Russia´s crude oil exports went to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary.European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere.The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year.But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful.Opec and other major oil producers cut production in late 2022 to sustain prices.Europe still relies on Russian gasReducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia.In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022, according to EU figures.In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none.EU states are increasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar.

The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia.However, ""there aren´t enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity.Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: ´The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries´.

Ukraine war: How Russia took the south - and then got stuck - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Ukrainian Border Guards ServiceImage caption, Security cameras captured the moment Russian forces crossed into southern Ukraine from occupied CrimeaBy Abdujalil Abdurasulov BBC News, MykolaivWhen Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, one of the biggest successes they achieved initially was in southern Ukraine. Within a few days Russian troops attacking from Crimea had seized an area of Ukrainian territory bigger than Switzerland. Ukrainian authorities are yet to explain what went wrong in the south in those early days. To help uncover what happened, the BBC has spoken to military officers, politicians and activists.On 22 February 2022 at 19:15, the secretary of Ukraine´s security council Oleksiy Danilov received a red folder with secret documents. They warned that the president´s life was under imminent threat. Immediately, Mr Danilov contacted the head of the security services, the interior minister, prime minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.But Ukraine´s leadership stopped short of declaring martial law, for now. There was no mobilisation of troops. Just a few weeks before, Ukrainian authorities had described Western warnings of Russian invasion as ""manipulation"" and called on everyone to remain calm.Mr Danilov says the government had detailed information about the planned invasion, including its dates. ""We expected it on 22 February,"" he explains, rolling out a secret map of the Kyiv region. Taken from a Russian commander, he says it confirms intelligence reports that Russia´s initial plan was to invade two days earlier than they actually did. ""Our goal was to avoid any panic inside the country. So, it was crucial to keep it all secret.""Image caption, This secret map dating back to 1989 was seized from a Russian commander and shows the attack plan around KyivIf the Ukrainian authorities knew so much about Moscow´s plans, why were Russian troops able to sweep across the Kherson region in the south so quickly?A strait and a narrow strip of land separate the Crimean peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland, and they were natural obstacles for Russian troops. So too was the extensive network of irrigation channels in the Kherson region.Ukrainian forces just needed to destroy all bridges there to slow down the Russian advance. But that did not happen.Mr Danilov says the authorities are currently investigating this, and until that process is over they cannot give an answer: ""But we are not hiding this fact, we are not putting it away in a drawer.""The Chonhar bridge which crosses the strait between Crimea and Kherson had been mined, Ukraine´s general staff confirmed after the invasion. But it rejected suggestions that the explosives had been defused, saying Russia´s invasion force was 15 times the size of Ukraine´s defence.Critics have argued it was precisely because of that Russian dominance that the bridge should have been destroyed.It is clear Ukrainian forces were not prepared for a scenario in which Russian troops easily crossed into the southern Kherson region. As a result, they had to retreat from the region right from the start. As they withdrew, it took two hours for columns of military vehicles and troops to cross the Antonivskiy bridge near Kherson city, according to Senior Lt Yevhen Palchenko, who defended the bridge over the Dnipro river.Image caption, Ukrainian intelligence expected the full-scale invasion two days before it happened, says Oleksiy DanilovThat indicates Ukraine had concentrated a large number of troops near Crimea. But with the bridges still standing, they were quickly outnumbered and outgunned.""How can you contain their offensive when we had no air defence?"" Lt Palchenko explains. ""Their fighter jets flew in and dropped a whole bunch of bombs, blowing up everything. We lost a lot of men and equipment there.""Speed was crucial for Russian success. Their tactic was to bypass large cities, encircle them and move on. They planned to take Mykolaiv in two days and Odesa in three days, says Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko, who was sent to organise Mykolaiv´s defence. But the Russian plan ended in failure. BBCWe stopped Russia´s forces because the people rose upMaj Gen Dmytro MarchenkoUkrainian militaryWhen Gen Marchenko arrived, there was still no plan to defend the city. ""When I asked where it was, I was told that they still hadn´t put together a map,"" he said.  He took a road map, divided it into four parts and appointed units and commanders responsible for each section. They announced mobilisation and quickly signed up thousands of people. Many of the newcomers had previously served in the army.  They set up anti-tank groups armed with grenade launchers and organised signal posts to warn when Russian tanks approached. In contrast to Kherson, bridges across irrigation channels in the region were destroyed by hastily set up special forces led by MP Roman Kostenko.Ukrainian troops fought fiercely to slow down the Russian advancement near the Antonivskiy bridge. At midnight on 25 February, Russian forces went on the offensive. Lt Palchenko and his tank battalion were there to stop them. ""My tank took a few hits, and the system was down. So, we had to do everything manually, like in T-34 tanks during World War Two.""  Image source, Maj Gen MarchenkoImage caption, Hastily organised Ukrainian defenders blew up bridges around Mykolaiv, halting the Russian invadersThe Russian forces were overwhelming, so Lt Palchenko and his battalion had to retreat from the bridge. But he went back there several times that night. His tanks covered Ukrainian paratroopers and their task was to prevent Russian troops from crossing the bridge.The then-23 year-old was later awarded the country´s top military honour, Hero of Ukraine.Their resistance gave Mykolaiv a few more days to prepare its defences. Co-ordination and communication between military and civilian teams meant that the time was used well.""[Mykolaiv Governor] Vitaliy Kim was amazing at communicating with people to organise help,"" Maj Gen Marchenko remembers. ""We needed excavators - they quickly went and dug [trenches and ditches]. We needed concrete blocks and anti-tank ´hedgehogs´ - in half a day, it was all done.""Local citizens constantly monitored the movement of Russian troops and passed co-ordinates to Ukrainian gunners. Ordinary people destroyed armoured vehicles and took prisoners, says Maj Gen Marchenko.""We stopped Russia´s forces because the people rose up,"" he adds.Additional reporting by Anna Tsyba.Related TopicsUkrainian governmentRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaCrimeaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64718740,27,02,2023,bbc,russia

"Ukraine war: Russia has committed crimes against humanity, US says - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: US Vice-President Kamala Harris says those involved in atrocities ""will be held to account""By George WrightBBC NewsThe US has ""formally determined"" that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine, US Vice-President Kamala Harris has said. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of ""gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation"" since its invasion.Moscow´s ambassador to the US rejected the claims and accused Ms Harris of trying to ""demonise Russia"".World leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine. UK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to ""double down"" on military support.The prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine, as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now. The conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches on 24 February. Sunak: Ukraine´s future must be ensured nowMs Harris told delegates that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held to account. ""Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity,"" she said. The UN defines crimes against humanity as a ""widespread or systemic attack"" on a particular civilian population.Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion. Anatoly Antonov, Russia´s ambassador to the US, said the vice-president´s claims were a cynical attempt to ""demonise Russia in the course of a hybrid war"".They were a way of ""justifying Washington´s own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis"", he added, referring to the US supply of arms to Kyiv.But Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, was adamant that ""in the case of Russia´s actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity"".She cited ""barbaric and inhumane"" atrocities committed during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found in Bucha shortly after the invasion and the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol.""Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,"" Ms Harris said.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Evidence grows of civilian killings in BuchaCrimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.Ukraine´s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had ""waged a genocidal war"" because it did not think Ukrainians ""deserve to exist as a sovereign nation"".Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin´s invasion.This conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders. It´s a chance for them to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and demonstrate their resolve. Rishi Sunak called for a new Nato charter to guarantee Ukraine´s long-term security. Kamala Harris formally accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity. But in the margins, there have been voices of doubt. Take the prime minister of Namibia, Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila. She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains. It´s opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds. There is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia´s invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.Russia was also on the agenda during a meeting on Saturday between the Antony Blinken and Wang Yi, the US and China´s top foreign policy officials.During talks at the conference in Munich, Mr Blinken warned of consequences if China were to provide material support to Russia´s invasion.Mr Blinken is expected to suggest China is ""at least contemplating providing"" lethal assistance to Russia in an interview to be aired on Sunday morning on NBC News.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaInternational Criminal CourtUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64691001,19,02,2023,bbc,russia
Ukraine war: Russian air strikes cut power at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Drone footage posted by Ukrainian official shows Lviv debris after Russian strikeBy Marita Moloney & Emily McGarveyBBC NewsAt least nine people have been killed and power at Europe´s largest nuclear plant has been lost after Russia launched missiles across Ukraine.The attacks hit cities from Kharkiv in the north to Odesa in the south and Zhytomyr in the west. Buildings and infrastructure were hit in Kharkiv and Odesa, with power blackouts in several areas. Attacks on the capital Kyiv are also reported.Ukraine said Russia fired 81 missiles, in what is the biggest strike in weeks.The military claimed it successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the eight Iranian-made Shahed drones which were fired.The attacks mark the biggest day of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine since the end of January, when 11 people died after dozens of buildings were struck in several regions. In Thursday´s attacks, at least five people were killed in Lviv in western Ukraine, after a rocket hit their home, the region´s governor Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram.Russian shelling killed three people in the southern city of Kherson, where a public transport stop was hit, Ukraine´s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said.While one person died and two others were injured following drone and missile strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to governor Serhii Lysak.How risky is stand-off over Ukraine´s nuclear plant?Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said a strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant meant the ""last link"" between the facility and the Ukrainian power system was cut off. For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility is now operating on diesel generators, which have enough supplies to last at least 10 days.The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was ""astonished by the complacency"" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.""Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,"" Rafael Grossi said.Russia-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine´s Zaporizhzhia region said the halt in electricity supplies to the power station from Ukrainian-held territory was ""a provocation"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was ""a difficult night"", after Russia resumed its ""wretched tactics"".He said energy systems were being restored and all services were working after the ""massive"" rocket attack struck critical infrastructure and residential buildings.In Kyiv, emergency services are at the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.Mr Klitschko said cars were burning in the courtyard of one residential building and he urged people to stay in shelters. Much of the city has been left without electricity, with four in 10 people without power, he added.Image source, ReutersImage caption, People gathered outside a residential building in Kyiv following the strikesA mass missile attack struck an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported, he added.""About 15"" strikes hit Kharkiv city and region, with ""critical infrastructure facilities"" and a residential building targeted, regional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said.Other regions hit include Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west, and Dnipro and Poltava in the centre of the country.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion just over a year ago. Since then tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured and millions of Ukrainians became refugees.The US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, suggested on Wednesday that President Putin might be planning to drag out the war for years but that Russia was not strong enough to launch major new offensives this year.She said the war in Ukraine had become a ""grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage"".""We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and that prolonging the war including with potential pauses in the fighting may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia´s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,"" she said.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Emergency workers attended burning cars damaged by the Russian missile strikes in KyivMs Haines said Russia might turn to defending the territories it now occupies, adding that it would need additional ""mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources"" to sustain even its level of operations in Ukraine.Ukraine´s military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.Why Bakhmut matters for Russia and Ukraine ""The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,"" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. ""Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.""Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say.

Ukraine war: Why Bakhmut matters for Russia and Ukraine - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Russia has virtually destroyed Bakhmut in its attempts to seize the cityBy James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent in KyivBakhmut lies in ruins.For more than seven long months, this small industrial city in eastern Ukraine has been pounded by Russian forces. According to its deputy mayor, Oleksandr Marchenko, there are just a few thousand civilians left living in underground shelters with no water, gas or power. ""The city is almost destroyed,"" he told the BBC. ""There is not a single building that has remained untouched in this war.""So why are Russia and Ukraine fighting so hard over this pile of rubble? Why are both sides laying down the lives of so many of soldiers to attack and defend this city in a battle that has lasted longer than any other in this war? Military analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value. It is not a garrison town or a transport hub or a major centre of population. Before the invasion, there were about 70,000 people living there. The city was best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery. It holds no particular geographic importance. As one Western official put it, Bakhmut is ""one small tactical event on a 1,200-kilometre front line"". And yet Russia is deploying huge military resources into taking the city. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ukraine has suffered many casualties - such as this soldier being buried in Lviv - in its defence of BakhmutThe Kremlin needs a victory, however symbolic. It has been a long time since the summer when Russian forces seized cities like Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Since then what territorial gains they have made have been incremental and slow. So Russia needs a success to sell to pro-Kremlin propagandists back home. Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre, told the BBC: ""They are fighting a political mission, not a purely military one. Russians will continue to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve their political goals.""Russian commanders also want to take Bakhmut for military reasons. They hope it might give them a springboard for further territorial gains. As the UK Ministry of Defence noted in December, capturing the city ""would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk"". And then there is question of the Wagner mercenary group that is at the heart of the assault. Its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. He hoped to show his fighters could do better than the regular Russian army. He has recruited thousands of convicts and is throwing waves of them at Ukrainian defences, many to their deaths. If he cannot succeed here, then his political influence in Moscow will diminish. Mr Prigozhin is at odds with Russia´s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, criticising his tactics and now complaining about not getting enough ammunition. There is, Mr Kuzan said, a political struggle between both men for influence in the Kremlin ""and the place for this struggle is in Bakhmut and its surroundings"". Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Few civilians remain in Bakhmut, which was once home to about 70,000 peopleSo why has Ukraine been defending Bakhmut so doggedly, losing thousands of troops in the process? The main strategic purpose is to use the battle to weaken Russia´s army. One Western official put it bluntly: ""Bakhmut, because of the Russian tactics, is giving Ukraine a unique opportunity to kill a lot of Russians."" Nato sources estimate five Russians are dying for every one Ukrainian in Bakhmut. Ukraine´s national security secretary, Oleksiy Danilov, says the ratio is even higher at seven to one. These numbers are impossible to verify. Serhii Kuzan told the BBC: ""As long as Bakhmut fulfils its function, allowing us to grind down the enemy´s forces, to destroy much more of them proportionately than the enemy inflicts losses on us, until then we will of course keep on holding Bakhmut."" By defending the city, Ukraine also ties up Russian forces that could be deployed elsewhere on the front line. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made the city an emblem of resistance. When he visited Washington in December, he called it ""the fortress of our morale"" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress. ""The fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and for freedom,"" he said. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The battle for Bakhmut has raged for monthsSo what if Bakhmut falls? Russia would claim a victory, a rare piece of good news to bolster morale. Ukraine would suffer a political, symbolic loss. No longer would Ukrainians be able to cry ""Bakhmut holds!"" on social media. But few believe there would be a huge military impact. The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""The fall of Bakhmut won´t necessarily mean that the Russians have changed the tide of this fight."" Mick Ryan, a strategist and former Australian general, believes there would be no fast Russian advance: ""The Ukrainians… will be withdrawing into defensive zones in the Kramatorsk areas that they have had eight years to prepare. And the city sits on higher, more defensible ground than Bakhmut. Any advance on the Kramatorsk region is likely to be every bit as bloody for the Russians as its campaign for Bakhmut."" So perhaps what matters most in the battle for Bakhmut are how many losses each side has incurred and what that might mean for the next phase in this war. Will Russia have suffered so many casualties that its capacity to mount further offensives will have been weakened? Or will Ukraine have lost so many soldiers that its army would be less able to launch a counter-offensive later in the spring?

Bakhmut: Russian casualties mount but tactics evolve - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: The battle for Bakhmut, a city in Ukraine´s eastern Donbas region, rages onBy Quentin SommervilleBBC NewsUkraine has drawn a line in the dirt, and that line is Bakhmut. It is a city that few say matters strategically, but that tens of thousands have died fighting over. It began more than seven months ago, and is the longest battle of the war so far. Two Ukrainian army brigades defending the city´s southern flank gave the BBC access to their positions last week as fierce fighting continued in and around Bakhmut. The men have spent months facing both regular Russian army forces, and prisoners recruited by the Wagner private military group who have swarmed their trenches in droves. Troops say Russian casualties far outweigh theirs, but the enemy is deploying new techniques to try to seize the city and surrounding countryside.Ukraine´s forces are outgunned and outnumbered, but on a chalk hillside to the south, there is the anti-tank group from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. 3Storm - as they are known - are unyielding. They´ve dug trenches deep into the earth. Timber props supporting the roof shudder as Russian artillery lands in the near distance, and field mice scurry along duck boards. An antiquated field telephone sits in a wooden nook; these are conditions their grandfathers would recognise. ""They cannot get to us, we can see for a kilometre in all directions,"" says a bearded 26-year-old soldier who goes by the call sign ""Dwarf"", pointing out Russian positions. ""We can hit the enemy with everything we have,"" he says.Image source, Quentin Sommerville / BBCImage caption, The 26-year-old goes by the call sign ""Dwarf"" as he´s a big Lord of the Rings fan - although the name on the body armour actually translates as ""Gnome""Neither the Russian nor Ukrainian armies release official casualty figures for Bakhmut, or elsewhere, but the mostly abandoned city has become a slaughter house.In a week fighting for the city, Dwarf´s company faced conscripted prisoners from Russia´s Wagner group. ""We had battles every two hours,"" he says. ""I guess a single company eliminated 50 people per day."" In case of any doubt, he points out these numbers were confirmed by aerial reconnaissance. ""The [Russian vehicle] arrives, 50 bodies come out, a day passes, 50 bodies come out again,"" he says. His company lost a fraction of that number, he says. Officially, Ukraine estimates that for every one of its soldiers killed, Russia loses seven. Earlier this week, Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members in a 24-hour period in the battle for Bakhmut. None of these numbers can be independently verified. In a newspaper interview, two captured Wagner conscripts told the Wall Street Journal that before they are sent forward, they receive little training beyond learning to crawl through forests in the dark. After six months serving at the front they are freed - assuming they survive.Conditions all along the 600-mile-long eastern front have begun to change. 3Storm´s chalky hilltop hideout feels like dry land compared with the surrounding territory. An early spring has turned the hard ground of winter to mud porridge - which may favour the defenders. To get there, we had to follow the Ukrainian soldiers on foot - within a few paces my boots become lumpen and heavy with thick dirt. A battlefield ambulance speeds by unsteadily, its caterpillar tracks ploughing up the ground, and spraying pools of sludge as it struggles for grip. The villages around here - the location can´t be revealed - are in ruin. Handwritten signs on gates, mostly in Russian, announce ""People Live Here"", a plea as much as it is a statement. But the streets are entirely empty, apart from abandoned dogs who roam the ruins of destroyed farms and homes. Image source, Stu Holland/ BBCImage caption, Soldiers move through the tall grassFor the past two months, Russian forces have steadily advanced, trying to encircle Bakhmut. The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, says his forces will continue to resist. ""Every day of steadfast resistance wins us valuable time to reduce the enemy´s offensive capabilities,"" he says, sending more reinforcements to the area. But it isn´t only Russians who have fallen into the Bakhmut trap. Ukrainians are dying there, too, in ever increasing numbers. On the hillside, a group of soldiers have gathered around a gun position, and I ask Dwarf - given that Ukraine is losing soldiers to untrained Russian convicts - if the defence of dead city, surrounded by the enemy, makes sense. He says, ""I was wondering, myself, if we should keep defending Bakhmut. On the one hand what´s happening here now is awful. There are no words to describe it. But the alternative is we give up Bakhmut and move to another settlement. What´s the difference between defending Bakhmut or any other village?""Image source, Darren Conway / BBCImage caption, ""Dwarf"" with his comrade ""Holm""His comrade, a strongly built man with a full dark beard who goes by the call sign Holm, agrees. ""It´s not a strategic question for us here. We are ordinary soldiers. But this is our land. We may then retreat to Chasiv Yar, from Chasiv Yar to Slovyansk, and so we retreat up to Kyiv. Let it take a year or two, four, five - but we have to fight for every piece of our land.""The men have been fighting for more than a year now, and they say the Russians are evolving. ""They are learning, they are getting cleverer, and it really freaks me out,"" says Dwarf. ""They send out a group - five morons taken from prison. They are shot, but the enemy sees where you are, walks around, and you are surrounded from behind.""Holm chimes in that Russia is now using drones armed with grenades more effectively. ""We used to drop them and freak them out,"" he says. ""Now they´re dropping drone grenades on our positions.""Before the war, Dwarf was an outdoor youth worker and would take youngsters hiking in the Carpathian Mountains on the country´s western edge. Here on Ukraine´s eastern front, that is a far-off memory. He´s been in many battles since then, but the horror of Bakhmut is what lives with him now. When I ask about Wagner´s convict army, he pauses to think and says, ""I´ll be honest. It´s genius. Cruel, immoral, but effective tactics. It worked out. And it´s still working in Bakhmut.""Image source, Quentin Sommerville / BBCImage caption, Soviet-era UAZ jeep makes it way through the mudDays later, I´m back in the same area, crammed with four others into a Soviet-era UAZ jeep. Its steering wheel has the BMW logo - a joke says the driver, Oleg. He says little else as he grips the wheel and concentrates hard as the car whines and struggles over hills and through the shoals of muck. The automatic gunfire ahead signals we are nearing the 28th Mechanised Brigade, who are directly facing the Russians. The landscape of war shifts in an instant - the men are holed up in a small wood, its trees shattered and split by Russian fire. In a month, the wood will offer them cover. For now, its bare branches expose them to surveillance drones. Nearby there´s an exchange of gunfire, and Russian shells strike around 500m away. But Borys, a 48-year-old former architect who is serving now as a captain, seems untroubled. ""Today´s war is a drone war,"" he says, ""but we can walk around freely, because there´s wind and rain today and drones are blown away. If it was quiet today, both our drones and our enemy´s would be hovering over us."" On the way back, Oleg brings the jeep to a sudden halt. Lying in the dirt in front of us is a drone that has been blown off course. Its battery is quickly removed and it is brought inside - it turns out to be Ukrainian.But today´s war isn´t so very different from the past. Image source, Quentin Sommerville / BBCImage caption, Maxim machine gunTwo nights before, the 28th Brigade was attacked by Russian infantry and tanks. In a timbered gun position below ground, the cold rain drips through the roof onto the dirt floor, and there, peering out into the bare landscape, is a Maxim belt-fed machine gun with stout iron wheels.""It only works when there is a massive attack going on…then it really works,"" says Borys. ""So we use it every week"". And this is how the battle for Bakhmut is being fought, as winter turns to spring in 21st Century Europe.

US-China trade hits record high despite rising tensions - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Monica MillerBBC NewsTrade between the US and China hit a record high last year even as their diplomatic relations deteriorated.Imports and exports between the two countries totalled $690.6bn (£572.6bn) in 2022, official figures show.Relations between the countries have hit new lows in recent days after a Chinese balloon travelled across the US. Beijing denies US claims it was used for spying.The world´s two biggest economies have also been in a trade war since 2018.The new figures show that US imports from China increased to $536.8bn last year as American shoppers spent more on Chinese-made goods, including toys and mobile phones. In the same period, US exports to China increased to $153.8bn.While some of the increase in trade between the two countries is a result of the rising cost of living, the figures also point to how reliant the US and China still are on each other even after years of trade conflict between them.""I think it´s an important indication of the difficulties of actually decoupling,"" Deborah Elms, the founder of Asian Trade Centre, told the BBC.   ""Even if governments, firms and consumers wanted to separate, the economics make it difficult to deliver products in a decoupled world at a price that firms and consumers are willing to pay,"" she added.High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesBiden moves to halt US exports to Huawei - reportsIn 2018, the Trump administration started to ramp up trade measures against Beijing.After decades of rising Chinese imports, Mr Trump began imposing tariffs on a total of more than $300bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by placing import levies on about $100bn of American goods.Most of those measures remain in place more than two years after Joe Biden became president.This month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been due to visit China in what was seen as a thawing of relations between the two country´s.America´s top diplomat was set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.However, the trip was abruptly postponed after the discovery of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that drifted across America. Chinese officials have repeatedly said that the ""airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident"".In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden made no direct mention of the Chinese balloon but said that his administration will always protect its sovereignty.""I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.

Xi Jinping begins historic third term as China's president - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Stephen McDonell & Joel Guintoin Beijing and SingaporeChina´s leader Xi Jinping has secured a historic third term as president from the country´s rubber-stamp parliament.It follows a consolidation of power that has made Mr Xi, 69, China´s most dominant leader in generations.In the Chinese system of governance, the functions of the president are largely ceremonial.Mr Xi´s power comes from him being General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).He was handed both posts at a party congress last October. Confirmation of his third term as president had been widely expected. The naming of a new premier and various ministers in the coming days is considered more important.The new appointees are mostly expected to be Xi Jinping loyalists. This includes Li Qiang, who is tipped to serve as Mr Xi´s number two.On Friday, Mr Xi has also gained another term as the chairman of the CMC of the People´s Republic of China. There are two CMCs in the country - one is a party organisation while another is a state institution - but their make-up is usually the same. Mr Xi has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests. The country is also facing a falling birth rate that threatens its economic growth engine.Ties between Beijing and Washington remain testy, recently highlighted by allegations China had been spying on the US with balloons.""Whether a strengthened Xi and increasing centralisation is sufficient to overcome these problems - or perhaps make them worse - is unknown and perhaps not knowable at present,"" Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University Singapore, told the BBC.""In a sense, Xi is betting that centralisation under the party with him at the helm is a solution to these disparate issues,"" he said.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: Why China´s president gets two teacups...in 59 secondsThe so-called Two Sessions of the National People´s Congress and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into China´s direction in the coming years.Since Mao Zedong, leaders in China had been limited to two terms in office. When Mr Xi had this restriction changed in 2018, it transformed him into a figure with a reach not seen since Chairman Mao.Also on Friday, the national legislature appointed Han Zheng, a 68-year-old former Politburo Standing Committee member, as vice president.The importance of the position varies since its functions are not fully defined. However, the last vice president, Wang Qishan, fronted Mr Xi´s anti-corruption campaign, Chong said.Chances are that Mr Han will follow Mr Xi´s direction closely and enforce the president´s policies as necessary, he added.Related TopicsXi JinpingAsiaChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64911512,10,03,2023,bbc,china
Canada's Trudeau launches China election meddling probes - BBC News,"Image source, CPACBy Max MatzaBBC NewsCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that an independent special rapporteur will probe alleged Chinese interference in their recent elections. The appointed investigator will review classified reports about the 2019 and 2021 federal elections and will make recommendations for future contests.Rival political party leaders have called for a public inquiry. China has denied any election interference, calling the claims ""purely baseless and defamatory"".Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Monday, Mr Trudeau said the reports challenging Canada´s ""sovereignty"" are alarming, and ""strike us to our very core as Canadians"". ""I will be appointing an independent special rapporteur, who will have a wide mandate and make expert recommendations on combating interference and strengthening our democracy,"" Mr Trudeau said.The rapporteur has not yet been chosen, he said, adding that the appointment will be made in the coming days.Mr Trudeau also said he would ask members of parliament and senators in the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (Nsicop) to begin a review of foreign interference and to report its findings to parliament.He added that Canada has long been aware of meddling attempts by China, as well as Iran and Russia. The countries, as well as several other non-state actors, ""have attempted to interfere not only in our democracy, but our country in general"". ""This is not a new problem,"" he said.Why Trudeau is facing calls for a public inquiryA series of reports in the Globe and Mail newspaper and broadcaster Global News in recent weeks, based on leaks from Canadian intelligence sources, detailed alleged attempts by China´s Communist Party to interfere in the last two federal elections.Chinese officials have dismissed the reports as ""purely baseless and defamatory"" and as ""hype"".Conservative politicians have said publicly they were aware of interference in 2021 race, and believe it had cost them several seats - though not enough to change the election result, which Mr Trudeau´s Liberals won with a 41-seat lead.A federal public report last week found that efforts to meddle in the 2021 federal election did not affect the results. Federal opposition parties - the New Democrats and the Conservatives - have been pushing for an ""independent and public"" inquiry into the accounts.In response to Mr Trudeau´s announcement, the New Democrats criticised the Nsicop committee probe, arguing it was not an ""acceptable substitute for a public inquiry"". ""The way to stop foreign actors from acting in secret is to refuse to keep their secrets,"" said New Democrat MP Peter Julian.The leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre, called Mr Trudeau´s announcement a ""cover up"" by Liberals ""to avoid accountability"".The rapporteur will have the authority to recommend a public inquiry, Mr Trudeau said in response to critics.""We will abide by their recommendation,"" he said, calling the decision one of the official´s first tasks after being appointed. ""I know there are people out there who don´t believe this is enough,"" Mr Trudeau continued. ""I get that. This is why we´re entrusting further work to someone impartial.""Also on Monday, the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they had opened an investigation into how information about the alleged meddling was leaked to Canadian news outlets.A poll released last week by the Angus Reid Institute found that around 65% of Canadians say they believe that Beijing attempted to meddle in both recent federal elections. Two-thirds of Canadians also said that the federal government should do more to combat election meddling.Related TopicsChinaJustin TrudeauCanada",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64870472,07,03,2023,bbc,china

They will be the first Marvel films to play in Chinese theatres since Spider-Man: Far from Home in July 2019.Chinese officials have never explained why Marvel movies were blocked from screening in the country.But the apparent ban began at a time when tensions between the US and China reached a high amid a trade war.There was also no reason given by Marvel for the turnaround, in its brief announcement on Chinese social media network Weibo on Wednesday about the film release dates.But it still drew jubilant reactions from movie lovers. ""I feel like I´m dreaming,"" said one user, while another exclaimed, ""I have missed you so much"".""Can you also re-release Spider-Man and Doctor Strange?"" pleaded one fan, referencing movies that had been released during the hiatus and never hit the big screen in China.Meet Shang-Chi - the MCU´s first Asian superheroThe loss of the Chinese market in recent years has possibly cost Disney hundreds of millions of dollars. The first Black Panther movie in 2018 took in US$105m (£86m) at Chinese theatres, while the second Ant-Man movie that same year generated $121m, according to Box Office Mojo.The screening of foreign films is tightly controlled in China, which imposes a yearly quota. A division of the Chinese Communist Party´s propaganda department, the China Film Administration, decides if a foreign movie can be released in the country. Disney has previously refused requests from some countries, including China, to edit movies such as Eternals and Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness to remove references to same-sex relationships.Related TopicsMarvel ComicsChinaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

China Covid: Celebrity deaths spark fears over death toll - BBC News,"Image source, State TVImage caption, Opera singer Chu Lanlan died in December aged 40By Fan WangBBC News The growing number of Chinese public figures whose deaths are being made public is prompting people to question the official Covid death toll.The death of Chu Lanlan, a 40-year-old opera singer, last month came as a shock to many, given how young she was.Her family said they were saddened by her ""abrupt departure"", but did not give details of the cause of her death. China scrapped its strict zero-Covid policy in December and has seen a rapid surge of infections and deaths. There are reports of hospitals and crematoria becoming overwhelmed.But the country has stopped publishing daily cases data, and has announced only 22 Covid deaths since December, using its own strict criteria.Now only those who die from respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia are counted.On Wednesday the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that China was under-representing the true impact of Covid in the country - in particular deaths.How is China trying to beat its latest Covid surge?China under-representing Covid deaths, WHO warnsBut the deaths of Chu Lanlan and others is sparking speculation about greater losses than those reported on official accounts.According to the specialist news website Operawire, Chu Lanlan was a soprano who specialised in Peking Opera - a theatrical art in which performers use speech, song, dance and combat movements to tell stories - and was also involved in charitable causes. On New Year´s Day news of the death of actor Gong Jintang devastated many Chinese internet users. Image source, Guangdong TVImage caption, Gong Jintang was known for his performance in the country´s longest-running TV series, In-Laws, Out-laws.Gong, 83, was known to many households for his performance in the country´s longest-running TV series, In-Laws, Out-laws. His portrait of Father Kang had captivated fans for more than two decades since the show first aired in 2000.The cause of his death is unclear, but many social media users linked it to the recent deaths of other older people.""Please god, please treat the elderly better,"" his co-star Hu Yanfen wrote on Chinese social media platform Weibo.""R.I.P Father Kang. This wave have really claimed many elders´ lives, let´s make sure we protect the elderly in our families,"" one user wrote on Weibo.Acclaimed scriptwriter Ni Zhen was also among recent deaths. The 84-year-old was famous for his work on the 1991 film Raise the Red Lantern, which is widely considered to be one of the best Chinese films by critics.Meanwhile Hu Fuming, a former journalist and retired professor of Nanjing University, died on 2 January at the age of 87. He was the main author of a famous commentary published in 1978 that marked the start of the China´s ""Boluan Fanzheng"" period - a time of eliminating chaos and returning to normal after the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution under the country´s first Communist leader Mao Zedong.Image source, Phoenix TV Image caption, Hu Fuming was a well known scholar and authorAccording to a tally by Chinese media, 16 scientists from the country´s top science and engineering academies died between 21 and 26 December.None of these deaths were linked to Covid in their obituaries, but that hasn´t prevented speculation online.""Did he also die of ´bad flu´?"" one of the top-rated comments under news of Mr Ni´s death said.""Even if you trawl through the whole internet you can´t find any reference to his cause of death,"" said another internet user.But there was also criticism of demonstrators who took to the streets in November in rare political protests calling for the end of leader Xi Jinping´s zero-Covid policy.""Are those people happy now, seeing old people... now paving the way for their freedom?"" asked one social media user.The new generation powering China´s protestsMr Xi appeared to refer obliquely to the protests in his New Year´s address, saying it was natural in such a big country for people to have different opinions.But he urged people to come together and show unity as China entered a ""new phase"" in its approach to Covid.The Chinese authorities are aware of the widespread scepticism although they continue to play down the severity of this wave of Covid sweeping the country. In an interview with state TV, the director of Beijing´s Institute of Respiratory Diseases admitted the number of deaths of elderly people so far this winter was ""definitely more"" than in past years, while also stressing that critical cases remained a minority of the overall number of Covid cases.This week the People´s Daily, the Communist Party´s official newspaper, urged citizens to work towards a ""final victory"" over Covid and dismissed criticism of the previous zero-Covid policy.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: Ros Atkins on...

Ukraine war: Blinken says China might give weapons to Russia - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesBy Samuel Horti in London and James Landale in MunichBBC NewsThe US says China is considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia for the Ukraine war - a claim strongly denied by Beijing.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Chinese firms were already providing ""non-lethal support"" to Russia and new information suggested Beijing could provide ""lethal support"".Such an escalation would mean ""serious consequences"" for China, he warned.Beijing said the claims were false and accused Washington of spreading lies.""We do not accept the United States´ finger-pointing on China-Russia relations, let alone coercion and pressure,"" China´s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference on Monday, when asked about the allegations.China has also denied reports that Moscow has requested military equipment.Chinese President Xi Jinping is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and is yet to condemn Russia´s invasion of Ukraine - but he has sought to remain neutral in the conflict and has called for peace.Mr Blinken was speaking to CBS News after he met China´s top diplomat, Wang Yi, on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.He said that during the meeting he expressed ""deep concerns""  about the ""possibility that China will provide lethal material support to Russia"".""To date, we have seen Chinese companies... provide non-lethal support to Russia for use in Ukraine. The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they´re considering providing lethal support,"" he said. He did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China´s potential plans. When pressed on what the US believed China might give to Russia, he said it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition.The US has sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly providing satellite imagery of Ukraine to the mercenary Wagner Group, which supplies Russia with thousands of fighters. Mr Blinken told CBS that ""of course, in China, there´s really no distinction between private companies and the state"".What support is China offering Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?If China provided Russia with weapons, that would cause a ""serious problem for us and in our relationship"", he added.Relations between Washington and Beijing were already poor after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in early February. Both sides exchanged angry words, but equally both sides appeared embarrassed by the incident and seemed ready to move on.But if China were to deliver weapons to help Russian forces in Ukraine, then US-Chinese relations would deteriorate much more severely.It would be the most ""catastrophic"" thing that could happen to the relationship between the two giants, said top Republican senator Lindsay Graham.""It would be like buying a ticket on the Titanic after you saw the movie,"" he told ABC News. ""Don´t do this.""Mr Blinken´s warning seems to be clearly designed to deter China from doing that.Mr Blinken also said the US was worried about China helping Russia evade Western sanctions designed to cripple Russia´s economy. China´s trade with Russia has been growing, and it is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas, and coal.Nato members, including the US, are sending a variety of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, including tanks. They have stopped short of sending fighter jets, and Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether the US would help other countries supply jets.""We´ve been very clear that we shouldn´t fixate or focus on any particular weapons system,"" he said. He did, however, say that the West must ensure Ukraine had what it needed for a potential counter offensive against Russia ""in the months ahead"". Russia is currently trying to advance in eastern regions of Ukraine, where some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place.The top US diplomat´s remarks come ahead of a scheduled visit by Mr Wang to Moscow, as part of the Chinese foreign policy chief´s tour of Europe.Mr Wang said in Munich on Saturday that China had ""neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire"" for the Ukraine war, Reuters reported.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chinese foreign affairs Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech in Munich on SaturdayChina would publish a document that laid out its position on settling the conflict, Mr Wang said. The document would state that the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, he said.""I suggest that everybody starts to think calmly, especially friends in Europe, about what kind of efforts we can make to stop this war,"" Mr Wang said.He added that there were ""some forces that seemingly don´t want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon"", but did not say who he meant. The Chinese President, Mr Xi, is scheduled to deliver a ""peace speech"" on the anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, 24 February, according to Italy´s foreign minister Antonio Tajani.Mr Tajani told Italian radio that Mr Xi´s speech would call for peace without condemning Russia, Reuters reported.During their meeting, Mr Blinken and Mr Wang also exchanged strong words on the deepening row over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the US. Mr Blinken said during the meeting that the US would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Blinken told CBS that other nations were concerned about what he called China´s ""surveillance balloon program"" across five continents.Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"". China has denied sending a spy balloon.And on Sunday morning, Beijing warned that the US would ""bear all the consequences"" if it escalated the argument over the balloon. China would ""follow through to the end"" in the event ""the US insists on taking advantage of the issue"", it said in a foreign ministry statement reported by Reuters.The full interview with CBS - the BBC´s US broadcasting partner - is due to air on Sunday.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64695042,20,02,2023,bbc,china
Lavrov visit to South Africa: Pandor defends joint Russia-China military exercise - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Both parties described the other as a friend, with Naledi Pandor describing their talks as ""wonderful""By Cecilia Macaulay & Pumza FihlaniBBC News, London & PretoriaSouth Africa has defended its decision to hold a joint military exercise with Russia and China next month.Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor condemned the ""double-standard"" which says some countries can perform such exercises but others are not.""All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,"" Dr Pandor added.The comments came at a press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Pretoria.The event attracted a small group of protesters outside the venue, waiving Ukrainian flags.Dr Pandor went on to slam the suggestion that South Africa cannot conduct the military exercises it wants to as an ""abuse of international practice"".""This is just a natural set of exercises that occur between countries,"" she said.Africa Live: More on this and other stories from the continentHow Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaRussia and the West fight for Africa´s heartLast week South Africa´s military announced it would hold joint naval drills with Russia and China off its coast next month.But there has been some criticism that the exercise is not appropriate, given that it coincides with the first anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.Not much information has been given about the exercises, but the state-owned Tass news agency reports that a Russian warship armed with hypersonic cruise weapons will take part.The Ministry of Defence has also defended the planned drills, saying that South Africa has in the past hosted similar exercises with France, the US and countries from the Western Nato military alliance.The drills will run for 10 days from 17 February to 27 February in the port city of Durban, and Richards Bay.The aim is to share operational skills and knowledge, the South African National Defence Force said.Despite pressure from Western countries to condemn the Russian invasion, South Africa has remained neutral - to the disappointment of Ukraine. Speaking at the conference, Mr Lavrov said he appreciated the ""well balanced"" and ""considerate"" approach of South Africa to the Ukraine war, which South Africa´s Dr Pandor said must be resolved diplomatically and through negotiation.Officials in South Africa have repeatedly said they do not condone the invasion but will not be forced into choosing sides and are continuing to engage with both countries in a business-as-usual manner.Critics of South Africa´s stance have accused the country of playing coy.South Africa´s leaders have a connection to Russian dating back to the fight against white-minority rule, or apartheid, when some members of the country´s liberation movement received military training in Russia.In recent years that relationship has grown into business ties through the Brics bloc of emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Mr Lavrov was also in Africa in July 2022, when he visited Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville, and South Africa is not alone in refusing to take sides in the war in Ukraine.Many African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West and East Africa respectively - voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March last year, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine.However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa, including South Africa.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSergei LavrovRussiaSouth Africa",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64373448,23,01,2023,bbc,china
"China spy balloon: Three unidentified objects possibly benign, says US - BBC News","Image source, ReutersImage caption, The FBI is examining wreckage from the first balloon shot downBy Max MatzaBBC NewsThe White House has said there is no indication three flying objects blasted out of the sky over the weekend by the US military are linked to alleged Chinese spying.The objects may be ""tied to commercial or research entities and therefore benign"", spokesman John Kirby said. US and Canadian officials have not yet located or recovered any wreckage from the three downed aircraft. Beijing earlier accused the US of ""a trigger-happy overreaction"".China has denied one of its balloons, which was destroyed by a US fighter jet earlier this month off South Carolina, was being used for espionage, saying it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown off course.How has China reacted to the balloon saga?At Tuesday´s daily news conference, Mr Kirby said it will be difficult to determine the purpose or origin of the three other objects that were destroyed over Alaska, Canada and Michigan until the debris is found and analysed.""We haven´t seen any indication or anything that points specifically to the idea that these three objects were part of the PRC´s [People´s Republic of China] spying programme,"" the White House National Security Council told reporters, ""or that they were definitively involved in external intelligence collection efforts"".A ""leading explanation"" being considered by US intelligence, he added, was that ""these could be balloons that were simply tied to commercial or research entities and therefore benign"".But he noted that no company, organisation or government had yet laid claim to the objects.In the most recent strike - over Lake Huron - the first Sidewinder missile fired by a US F-16 warplane missed its target, the top US general has confirmed.""First shot missed. Second shot hit,"" said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley during a visit to Brussels on Tuesday.""We go to great lengths to make sure that the airspace is clear and the backdrop is clear up to the max effective range of the missile. And in this case, the missiles land, or the missile landed, harmlessly in the water of Lake Huron.""A spokesman for China´s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meanwhile, criticised the American response.""Many in the US have been asking, ´what good can such costly action possibly bring to the US and its taxpayers?´"" said Wang Wenbin on Tuesday.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsSensors from the alleged Chinese spy balloon shot down over the US on 4 February were recovered from the Atlantic Ocean on Monday, and are being analysed by the FBI.Search crews found ""significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified"" off the coast of South Carolina, said US Northern Command.The Chinese balloon was being tracked by US intelligence since its lift-off from a base on Hainan Island on the south coast of China earlier this month, US media report. Shortly after take-off the balloon drifted towards the US islands of Guam and Hawaii before moving north towards Alaska, American officials told CBS News, the BBC´s partner.The unnamed officials say that its path indicates that it could have been blown off course by weather, but that it was back under the Chinese control again by the time it reached the continental US.

China hits out at US over TikTok ban on federal devices - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Matt MurphyBBC NewsChina has accused the US of overreacting after federal employees were ordered to remove the video app TikTok from government-issued phones.On Monday, the White House gave government agencies 30 days to ensure that employees did not have the Chinese-owned app on federal devices. The order follows similar moves by the EU and Canada in recent weeks. A spokesperson for China´s foreign ministry accused the US of abusing state power to suppress foreign firms.""We firmly oppose those wrong actions,"" spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday. ""The US government should respect the principles of market economy and fair competition, stop suppressing the companies and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies in the US.""""How unsure of itself can the world´s top superpower like the US be to fear young people´s favourite app like that?"" she added. Western officials have become increasingly concerned about the popular video sharing app - which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance - in recent months. However, Australia said it had not received any advice from its intelligence services recommending that it follow the examples of the US, the EU and Canada. TikTok has faced allegations that it harvests users´ data and hands it to the Chinese government, with some intelligence agencies worried that sensitive information could be exposed when the app is downloaded to government devices.The company insists it operates no differently to other social media companies and says it would never comply with an order to transfer data. On Monday, US Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young told agencies they had to scrub the app from all state-issued phones to protect confidential data. The agency said the guidance marked a ""critical step forward in addressing the risks presented by the app to sensitive government data"". Some federal offices - including the White House and the Departments of Defence, Homeland Security and State - have already banned TikTok from their devices. The US Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said the move emphasised the Biden administration´s ""ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people´s security and privacy"". Tuesday´s announcement follows the passage of legislation by the US House of Representatives in December which banned the use of TikTok on state-issued phones and gave the White House 60 days to issue agency directives. And congressional Republicans are expected to pass further legislation in the coming weeks which would give President Joe Biden the power to ban the app nationally. ""We hope that when it comes to addressing national security concerns about TikTok beyond government devices, Congress will explore solutions that won´t have the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans,"" a TikTok spokesperson told the BBC. TikTok answers three cybersecurity fears about appTikTok under investigation by Canadian privacy authoritiesIndia bans TikTok and dozens more Chinese appsCanada has also imposed a new ban on the app on government devices starting from Tuesday. The decision followed a review conducted by the country´s chief information officer, who ruled the app presented ""an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security"".Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change.""This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,"" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto.And the European Parliament also approved a ban on the app on staff phones, following the European Commission´s move last week. A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that the bans had been adopted ""without any deliberation"" and amounted to ""little more than political theatre"".

Joe Biden says he makes no apologies for downing China balloon - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: A quick history of aerial espionage. From birds to balloons, and everything in between.By George BowdenBBC News, Washington DCPresident Joe Biden has said he makes no apologies for shooting down an alleged Chinese spy balloon off the coast of the US.He said the balloon was used for surveillance, but three other objects shot down over North America were unlikely to be foreign spy craft.The US would now improve its detection of similar aerial objects, he said.Mr Biden also said he would speak with China´s President Xi Jinping soon about this month´s incident.""I hope we are going to get to the bottom of this, but I make no apologies for taking down that balloon,"" Mr Biden said at the White House on Thursday.China has denied the balloon was used for surveillance, instead saying it blew off course while collecting weather data.But Mr Biden reiterated the view of US officials that the balloon, which traversed the country at an altitude of about 40,000ft (12,000m) before being blown out of the sky by a US fighter jet over the Atlantic, was in fact used for spying.He said the US was continuing to speak with China on the issue. ""We are not looking for a new cold war,"" Mr Biden said.Brief remarks leave questions unanswered Joe Biden has been under increasing pressure to talk directly to the public about the alleged Chinese surveillance balloon, as well as the three unidentified objects American fighter jets have scrambled to destroy over the past week.On Thursday afternoon he did that - but his brief appearance will do very little to silence critics or those asking for more information and explanations.He shed no light on the nature of those objects and provided no further information about the first Chinese balloon. He didn´t discuss when the Chinese balloon was first detected, its intended purpose or recent reports that it had been directed toward the US island of Guam but then changed course. Nor did he say why, after a flurry of incidents last week, no new objects have been targeted.As an explanatory endeavour, it was weak sauce. And as a public-relations effort, it will probably come up short.It may calm the waters for now, but the next time a balloon floats across the American sky, or fighters scramble and missiles fly, the questions will return with renewed urgency.Speaking about three other objects subsequently shot down over Alaska, north-west Canada and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border, Mr Biden said the intelligence community believed they were ""most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions"".The president said enhanced radar introduced in response to the Chinese balloon might explain the discovery of the three objects.""That´s why I´ve directed my team to come back to me with sharper rules for how we will deal with these unidentified objects moving forward, distinguishing between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not.""This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsMr Biden´s comments came after the White House felt the need to dispel suggestions the three objects were of extra-terrestrial origin.Officials said the slow-moving unidentified objects did not pose ""any direct threat to people on the ground"" and were destroyed ""to protect our security, our interests and flight safety"".The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which was co-ordinating searches for the objects in Canada, said on Thursday it would suspend the search of Lake Huron, in part due to the low probability of recovery.Americast: Aliens or air balloons?On whether he would take similar action again, Mr Biden said: ""Make no mistake, if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people I will take it down.""He declined to say when he planned to speak with China´s President Xi as he was asked during an interview with NBC News.""I think the last thing that Xi wants is to fundamentally rip the relationship with the United States and with me,"" Biden told the broadcaster.China has repeated its explanation for the balloon shot down on 4 February, with a spokesman telling reporters the US should try to avoid ""misunderstandings and misjudgements"".Amid the heightened tensions over US skies, military officials said on Thursday that American warplanes had intercepted Russian jets flying near Alaska for a second time this week. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad), which is jointly run by the US and Canada, said in a statement that it was a ""routine"" contact with the Russians.Related TopicsChinaUnited StatesJoe Biden",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64668143,16,02,2023,bbc,china
China removes giant rabbit lantern criticised as too ugly - BBC News,"Related TopicsChinese New YearImage source, Social mediaImage caption, A rabbit lantern, now torn down, stirred a controversyA giant rabbit lantern was torn down in south-west China after internet users complained it was too ugly. The lantern was placed at Sanxia Square in Chongqing, a city of 30 million, to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year. ""The rabbit has thick eyebrows and looks like a man with a serious expression. Is this a festive rabbit?"" said a user of messaging app WeChat.In the Chinese zodiac, 2023 is the Year of the Rabbit. ""Internet users say that the rabbit lantern at the square is too embarrassing. After the complaint, we got someone to demolish it,"" the Sangxia Square Commercial District Management Committee told local media outlet Hongxin News. Another WeChat user wrote: ""It looks like a rabbit goblin.""But some people said it wasn´t necessary to remove the lantern saying that it just looked like traditional ones. The rabbit is considered an adorable and gentle animal in Chinese culture. There was also backlash against one of the special stamps for the Year of the Rabbit, released by China Post earlier this month.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Some people say this year´s zodiac stamp looks horrifyingThe stamp features a blue rabbit with red eyes which has a pen and a piece of paper - but internet users have called it ""evil"", ""scary"" and ""monstrous"".

Solomon Islands: US reopens embassy in push to counter China - BBC News,"Image source, US EMBASSYImage caption, Washington has re-established a diplomatic presence on the Solomon Island after a 30-year absenceBy Frances MaoBBC NewsThe US has reopened its Solomon Islands embassy in a move widely seen as shoring up influence in the Pacific to counter China´s push into the region.Last year Washington and its allies were blindsided when the tiny nation signed a security deal with Beijing.It came after the US had already said it would reopen its Honiara post - closed in 1993 - amid concerns over China´s growing military ambitions.The Solomons PM did not attend the embassy´s opening on Wednesday.However a foreign ministry spokesman said the re-established US embassy was welcomed by the government.The region is strategically crucial for the US as a gateway to Asia for Pacific allies like Australia. Washington´s diplomatic presence has until now largely been centred in its Papua New Guinea post.But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the Honiara embassy would help advance the US-Pacific partnership goals - signed last year - of keeping the region a place where ""democracy can flourish"".US secures Philippines deal to complete arc around ChinaIsland trip lays bare US-China tussle in the PacificThe embassy opening comes at ""an important moment for the region we share"", he said in a video statement.""Because more than any other part of the world - the Indo-Pacific region including the Pacific islands - will shape the world´s trajectory in the 21st Century.""Skip twitter post by USEmbassyPOMThe United States of America is pleased to announce the opening of its Embassy in Honiara.

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.End of twitter post by USEmbassyPOMConcerns about Beijing´s increasing influence and military expansion in the Pacific has prompted the US and Australia to step up their focus there in recent years.Last September, US President Joe Biden invited 14 Pacific island nations to the White House for the first-ever in-person summit. Washington signed a sweeping partnership and development agreement with the island nations.Solomon Islands PM Manasseh Sogavare also signed up to the deal despite reports in the lead-up that he might abstain.Beijing last year had also accelerated efforts to gain influence in the region - to mixed effect. While it inked a security deal with the Solomons in March, it failed to secure a trade and security deal with 10 regional countries a few months later despite a lobbying tour from China´s then Foreign Minister Wang Yi.""China has no intention of competing with anyone, let alone engaging in geopolitical competition, and has never established a so-called sphere of influence,"" said Mr Wang during the tour. In recent times, Fiji, one of the biggest and most influential Pacific islands, has also announced it will cancel a police training exchange with China - formerly a close partner.Fiji´s new government - elected in December - has indicated it prefers stronger ties with its traditional Pacific partners Australia and New Zealand over China.Australia and NZ are also both members of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) - the region´s main bloc. Several Pacific countries have advocated for regional unity in the face of superpower tensions and on Monday, many welcomed the announcement that Kiribati would return as a member.Kiribati had withdrawn from the PIF last year in a move the country´s opposition said had been influenced by Beijing. The country´s leader had then said the forum wasn´t adequately addressing the concerns of Micronesian countries.Dr Meg Keen from the Australia-based Lowy Institute said the US re-engagement was welcomed but it would remain to be seen ""if the announcements are backed up by actions"".She said the region could see a ""diverse range of partnerships"" as Pacific islands pursue development goals and funding.The new US embassy also comes as Washington has been re-negotiating agreements with three island nations in the North Pacific - Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands - who give exclusive military use rights to the US.Related TopicsChinaSolomon IslandsUnited StatesAustralia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64494244,02,02,2023,bbc,china
Second balloon over Latin America is ours - China - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, The first balloon, which was spotted over the United States, before it was shot down off the South Carolina coastThe Chinese government has admitted a balloon spotted over Latin America on Friday is from China - but claimed it is intended for civilian use.Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the aircraft had deviated from its route, having been blown off course.A similar balloon was shot down in US airspace by military jets on Saturday amid allegations that it was being used for surveillance. China has denied accusations of spying, saying it was monitoring the weather.The incident has led to a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.On Friday - before fighter jets brought down the balloon at the weekend - US military officials said a second Chinese balloon had been spotted over Latin America. On Monday, China admitted an aircraft had ""accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace"".Ms Mao told reporters the second balloon had ""deviated greatly"" from its intended route, citing the aircraft´s ""limited manoeuvrability"" and the weather conditions.""The unmanned airship in question that came from China is of a civilian nature and used for flight tests,"" she added.""China is a responsible country and has always strictly abided by international law in order to inform and properly deal with all parties concerned, without posing any threat to any country.""At the weekend, Colombia´s air force said an object with ""characteristics similar to those of a balloon"" had been detected on 3 February in the country´s airspace at above 55,000ft.Colombia said it had followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?Meanwhile, work by US Navy divers continues to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday.US President Joe Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until it was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk. The US believes the balloon was being used to monitor sensitive military sites.Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China´s suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because ""it has propellers on it"".""This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,"" he added.Relations between China and the US have been strained by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an ""unacceptable violation"" of its sovereignty. A planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China was cancelled as a result of the row.China has lodged a formal complaint with the US embassy in Beijing over the incident.Related TopicsSpyingChinaSurveillanceUnited StatesColombia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64537098,06,02,2023,bbc,china
South China Sea: Philippines says China used 'military-grade' laser against boat - BBC News,"Image source, Philippine Coast GuardImage caption, The Philippines has accused China of shining lasers on one of its boatsBy Joel GuintoBBC NewsThe Philippines has accused China of shining a ""military grade"" laser light to scuttle a resupply mission to a disputed shoal in the South China Sea.The laser glare temporarily blinded the crew of the Filipino coast guard boat, forcing it to retreat.The vessel was headed to a marooned navy vessel that Manila has used for years to claim the Second Thomas Shoal.China has in the past used water cannon and sirens to enforce its claim to much of the South China Sea.The incident, on 6 February, was only reported publicly on Monday. It was a ""clear violation of Philippine sovereign rights"" in waters that Manila refers to as the West Philippine Sea, the Filipino coastguard said in a statement.Aside from flashing laser light twice, the Chinese ship also made ""dangerous manoeuvres"" about 150 yards (137m) from the Filipino ship´s starboard side, authorities said.A spokesperson for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declined to comment to the BBC. There was no immediate comment from Beijing.In 2016, the UN´s Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that Beijing´s sweeping claims in the South China Sea have no historical basis.Tensions over the shoal - known as Ayungin in the Philippines - was one of the catalysts for the case, which was brought by the Philippines.However, the tribunal has no powers to enforce its ruling and China has continued to build giant structures over reefs in the waters - which are also disputed in part by Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte also refused to flaunt the arbitration ruling and instead sought to repair political and economic ties between Manila and Beijing as he pivoted the country away from its long-standing ally, the US.Mr Marcos, however, reversed the pivot.

Covid cases in China touch 900 million - study - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, MARK R CRISTINO/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockImage caption, Covid cases are expected to spike in China over the Lunar New YearBy Nicholas YongBBC NewsSome 900 million people in China have been infected with the coronavirus as of 11 January, according to a study by Peking University. The report estimates that 64% of the country´s population has the virus. It ranks Gansu province, where 91% of the people are reported to be infected, at the top, followed by Yunnan (84%) and Qinghai (80%).A top Chinese epidemiologist has also warned that cases will surge in rural China over the lunar new year.The peak of China´s Covid wave is expected to last two to three months, added Zeng Guang, ex-head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control.Hundreds of millions of Chinese are travelling to their hometowns - many for the first time since the pandemic began - ahead of the lunar new year on 23 January.China has stopped providing daily Covid statistics since abandoning zero-Covid. But hospitals in big cities - where healthcare facilities are better and more easily accessible - have become crowded with Covid patients as the virus has spread through the country.Speaking at an event earlier this month, Mr Zeng said it was ""time to focus on the rural areas"", in remarks reported in the Caixin news outlet.Many elderly, sick and disabled in the countryside were already being left behind in terms of Covid treatment, he added.China´s central Henan province is the only province to have given details of infection rates - earlier this month a health official there said nearly 90% of the population had had Covid, with similar rates seen in urban and rural areas.However government officials say many provinces and cities have passed the peak of infections.The Lunar New Year holidays in China, which officially start from 21 January, involves the world´s largest annual migration of people.Some two billion trips are expected to be made in total and tens of millions of people have already travelled.Chinese hope lunar new year consigns Covid to pastYoung Chinese self-infect amid Covid fears for elderlyLast month, China abruptly abandoned its zero Covid policies. It also reopened its borders on Sunday.Official data shows five or fewer deaths a day over the past month, numbers which are inconsistent with the long queues seen at funeral homes and reports of deaths on social media.In December Chinese officials said they planned to issue monthly rather than daily updates on the Covid situation in the country.The World Health Organisation (WHO) said China, which stopped reporting Covid fatalities from Tuesday, was heavily under-reporting Covid deaths. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin stressed again at a regular press briefing on Thursday that Beijing has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law"", having held technical exchanges with the WHO over the past month.International health experts have predicted at least a million Covid-related deaths in China this year. Beijing has officially reported just over 5,000 deaths since the pandemic began, one of the lowest death rates in the world.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64258799,13,01,2023,bbc,china
China balloon: Could it have been blown off course as Beijing claims? - BBC News,"Related TopicsReality CheckImage source, ReutersImage caption, Surveillance balloons follow the prevailing windsBy Daniele Palumbo, Jeremy Howell & Erwan RivaultBBC Reality CheckThe Chinese authorities say a surveillance balloon sighted over sensitive US territory is theirs, but insist its purpose is for weather research and that it was blown off course by unexpected winds.  We´ve looked at the prevailing wind patterns and data modelling to track its possible path.Where has the balloon been seen? It was monitored travelling across Canadian territory before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, where it was spotted in the sky by city residents.US authorities say they´ve been tracking the balloon across US airspace using manned aircraft, and that it´s been flying over sensitive military areas.Blown off course, says ChinaChina says strong ""westerlies"" blew the device ""with limited self-steering capability"" off its planned course.BBC Weather´s Simon King says that in the north Pacific between China and North America, the prevailing winds are westerlies (that is, from west towards the east).""In recent days, the wind speeds above an altitude of 30,000 to 40,000ft (9,000 to 12,000m) were 150mph (240km/h) or above in this area of the Pacific,"" he says. ""There is nothing unusual about wind speeds this high in this area."" The wind patterns in the north Pacific in the past few days would have blown the balloon north-east to Alaska and then south-east through Canada to Montana, he says. ""Most weather balloons rise to about 100,000ft and then blow apart after a few hours, with the equipment falling to Earth by parachute. It is unusual for a weather balloon to last days like this.""  Dr Marina Miron, researcher in defence studies at Kings College London says the balloon might have been more sophisticated than China claims.""The balloon could be controlled remotely by an operator on the ground,"" she says. ""They´d be able to raise or lower the altitude of the balloon so that it could pick up different wind currents which are going in different directions. ""You would want to be able to make it linger over a spot to collect data. This is something you can do with balloon which you cannot do with a satellite.""   Can we track its route?  Not with any certainty. We don´t have flight tracking data that we would for commercial airliner, for example, so we need to look to other sources of information.One technique used to estimate the path of high-altitude particles or objects is to use a model based on wind speeds and direction.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric US department (NOAA) has developed such a model (known as HYSPLIT) based on winds at altitudes over 14,000m (46,000ft).  ""Its primary use,"" says Simon King from BBC Weather, ""is for working out the transport and dispersion of things such as pollutants and hazardous material in the atmosphere.  ""The model also works backwards - called back trajectory - where we can see where anything carried in the air such as pollutants, ash or other material has come from.""In the case of the balloon over the US, this back trajectory can show where the air carrying the balloon originated from and by analysing wind direction and speed, where it´ll go in the future.""US meteorologist Dan Satterfield has used this model to calculate a possible route the surveillance balloon has taken, and has shared his findings online.  Starting from the position sighted in Montana on 1 February, he has estimated a possible back trajectory for the balloon, based on wind data, originating in central China.It must be stressed that this is not the actual path the surveillance balloon has taken, but an analysis based on the model developed by NOAA, a US government agency.Related TopicsSpyingChinaReality CheckUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64514120,03,02,2023,bbc,china
Covid: England to require negative test for arrivals from China - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, ReutersPassengers arriving in England from China will have to provide a negative Covid test before they board a flight, ministers have confirmed.It comes as several nations announced they would be screening travellers from China after cases surged following Beijing´s decision to relax its zero-Covid policy. China has said it will fully reopen its borders on 8 January.Several countries, including the US, France and India, have imposed testing.The Department of Health and Social Care said people travelling from China on direct flights from 5 January will be asked to take a pre-departure Covid test.From 8 January, the UK Health Security Agency will also launch surveillance, which will see a sample of passengers arriving from China tested for the virus as they arrive.Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the government was taking a ""balanced and precautionary approach"", adding the measures were ""temporary"" as officials assess the latest Covid data.The testing requirement only applies to people flying to English airports, with the government saying that while there are no direct flights from China to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, it is working with the devolved administrations to ensure the policy is applied UK-wide.China must share Covid data, says WHOSpain, South Korea and Israel tighten Covid testing rulesReality Check: Do restrictions on travel work against Covid? The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on Beijing to share ""real-time"" information on Covid - including on deaths, hospitalisations and vaccinations.The UN body said it was willing to offer support on data-sharing, adding that it was ""understandable"" that some countries were now imposing fresh restrictions. China´s foreign ministry said earlier this week that its ""epidemic situation"" overall was ""predictable and under control"". The Chinese government is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.The true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths.The UK government said its decision was due to a ""lack of comprehensive health information shared by China"".Spain, Israel and South Korea also announced on Friday that they will introduce testing requirements in response to the increasing number of infections in China.Some scientists have questioned the approach of the UK and US - saying it is better to screen people once they have arrived. Italy and Spain have introduced post-arrival testing. But not all countries have announced additional controls. Germany has joined Australia and Portugal in saying there will be no new rules yet.Concerns over impact of testing Prof Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the restrictions are unlikely to prevent new Covid variants reaching the UK and it was difficult to know what impact such a move would have here. He told BBC News: ""Trying to ban a virus by adjusting what we do with travel has already been shown not to work very well.""We´ve seen that with the bans on travel from various countries during the pandemic, that hasn´t stopped those viruses travelling around the world eventually.""But there is concern that more infections can provide more opportunities for the virus to mutate. Countries that plan to test travellers say the policy will help spot worrying new variants early and prevent an influx of cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said testing visitors from China, Hong Kong and Macau was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"".The government had also come under pressure from Conservative MPs who want a more robust response.The new requirement for travellers from China to provide negative tests was welcomed by Tory MP Steve Brine, chairman of the Commons health and social care committee.He told BBC Radio 4´s Today programme that the move would reduce the number of passengers with infections, and help to identify new variants of the disease.But he said the policy was not about trying to ""ban a virus"" - adding that ministers were not trying to repeat the ""Beijing folly of an unattainable zero-Covid policy"".Related TopicsTravelUK governmentChinaCoronavirus testingCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64130655,31,12,2022,bbc,china
China Covid: Young people self-infect as fears for elderly grow - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Life is slowly inching back to normal in ChinaWhen Mr Chen´s 85-year-old father fell ill with Covid in December, it was impossible to get an ambulance or see a doctor.They went to Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, where they were told to either try other hospitals or sit in the corridor with an IV drip.""There was no bed, no respiratory machine, no medical equipment"" available, Mr Chen tells the BBC.His father managed to find a bed at another hospital, but only through a special contact, and had by then developed a severe lung infection.The elder Mr Chen has now recovered, but his son worries that a second infection in the future could kill him.Three years of Covid prevention measures were a complete waste and failure, he says, because the government eased controls too quickly, with no preparation, and so many have caught the virus.""The outbreak will come back again. For elderly people, they can only count on their own fate,"" Mr Chen says. The final step in China´s swift reversal of its contentious zero-Covid policy comes on Sunday when it reopens borders for international travel. With mass testing, stringent quarantines and sudden, sweeping lockdowns gone, families like Mr Chen´s are wary of what lies ahead. But younger Chinese, all of whom did not wish to be named, feel differently - and some told the BBC they were voluntarily exposing themselves to infection.   A 27-year-old coder in Shanghai, who did not receive any of the Chinese vaccines, says he voluntarily exposed himself to the virus.""Because I don´t want to change my holiday plan,"" he explains, ""and I could make sure I recovered and won´t be infected again during the holiday if I intentionally control the time I get infected."" He admits he did not expect the muscle aches that came with the infection, but says the symptoms have been largely as expected.Another Shanghai resident, a 26-year-old woman, tells the BBC she visited her friend who had tested positive ""so I could get Covid as well"". But she says her recovery has been hard: ""I thought it would be like getting a cold but it was much more painful.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There is concern about how elders will fare under loosened pandemic rulesA 29-year-old who works for a state-run business based in Jiaxing, in the northern Zhejiang province, says she was thrilled when she heard the country´s borders were reopening. She is excited to travel to other parts of China again to see concerts. ""Life was ridiculous when I had to ask my manager´s permission to travel. I just want life to get back to normal,"" she says. ""But I do worry about the elderly.""When her grandfather fell sick with Covid, he refused to go to hospital, even when his condition took a turn for the worse, she says. And reports of overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums have only added to the worry - she says she has heard stories of corpses piled high in funeral parlours.She herself has not tested positive for the virus yet, but concedes that - when her husband did - she wore a mask 24/7 at home, even when she was sleeping.""I did not want us to be sick at the same time,"" she says. ""But I´m not scared of the virus, as the severe symptoms are rare.""Celebrity deaths spark fears over China Covid tollChina under-representing Covid deaths, WHO warnsAt least in the big cities, people have been returning to malls, restaurants and parks, and even queuing up for visas and tourist permits. The state-run Global Times newspaper declared ""normal times are back"", attributing the line to interviews with Chinese.   If normal days are indeed back, it is an uncomfortable return to normalcy for many.Mrs Liu´s husband never got vaccinated because he suffers from advanced diabetes. Since the re-opening, she has stayed indoors and has disinfected every home delivery that has arrived, but the couple still caught the virus.Their daughter, also sick with Covid, scoured various locations in the midst of a cold Beijing winter for Paxlovid, Pfizer´s anti-viral Covid medication, before finally purchasing a single box off the black market at 7500 CNY (£918).""My husband has recovered smoothly. It´s a big relief for me,"" Mrs Liu says. ""But when the second wave comes, what will happen to him?""Ms Wang, another Beijing resident, and her family have pre-purchased Paxlovid before it becomes too expensive, as well as an oxygenator and pulse oximeter, for her grandfather-in-law. He has not gotten the virus but is in his 90s.""Anyways, the open-up is good for the economy. Business has recovered quickly,"" she remarks, adding that hotels, restaurants and shopping malls are all filling up with people again.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Despite the fear over the Covid surge, people are going back to restaurants and mallsBut beyond the major cities, it is difficult to know how people - particularly in China´s rural regions - are responding to an about-face in government messaging.For three years, state-run media presented the virus as a dangerous menace to society, vowing that it would achieve ""dynamic zero-Covid"" to keep the population safe.But that rhetoric has been turned on its head in recent weeks, with doctors regularly trotted out to call for calm over confusion.Mrs Li, a 52-year-old in Beijing, argues the government ""did the right thing"" for the first two years but should have ended its zero-Covid policy in early 2022.""Now we finally have all controls eased, but it´s too sudden. The government could have done it phase by phase, region by region. Also winter is the worst season to do it. Why not wait until next spring? And why didn´t the government prepare enough resources before opening up?"" she asks.""2022 was the worst year for us. I can only pray 2023 won´t be any worse.""Related TopicsAsiaChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64183281,06,01,2023,bbc,china
China Covid: New year optimism sees hopes of moving beyond virus - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, EPAImage caption, The Chinese new year migration is under way with two billion trips expectedBy Stephen McDonell in BeijingBBC NewsWhen you arrive in China now the officials in head-to-toe protective clothing are gone. There are no buses with special plastic dividers waiting to take you to centralised quarantine. The main reminder that Covid is still around is that people are wearing masks.It feels weird.You still need a PCR test before flying and arriving passengers fill in a health declaration form, accessible via phone apps. This then generates a temporary QR code. You scan the code when you come through the airport and then, after clearing immigration, simply walk out and into China.As a journalist, I had to wait for an hour for special clearance to enter. During that time I and another waiting reporter had a long chat with one of the immigration police.It was the first day they didn´t have to wear the ""da bai"" (big white) protective gear over their uniforms or face shields or shoe covers. Was it a relief?""Yeah, it actually wasn´t that bad,"" he said.Chinese New Year is fast approaching but this officer said he would not be heading back to his hometown to ring in the Year of the Rabbit. There would be too much work for the immigration police over the coming weeks making sure that the new travel systems were in place and operating, he said.Getting rid of most zero-Covid travel restrictions before the Spring Festival has meant that many who have not been able to visit friends and relatives in China are rushing to buy plane and train tickets in time. Then there are the Chinese citizens who haven´t been able to go overseas for years - they too are making plans again. Most observers expect international tourists will soon be allowed back in.The speed of the change in China´s Covid approach has been breathtaking.What seems to have triggered this dramatic about-face were the protests against China´s zero-Covid policy late last year. Discontent had been building for a long time, but once demonstrators started chanting publicly that leader Xi Jinping should resign and the Communist Party give up power, that was more than even this country´s all-powerful government could bear.Image source, ReutersImage caption, There are long queues at offices issuing passports and permits to travel to Hong KongThe end of mass-testing, city-wide lockdowns and centralised quarantine sent Covid flying through the Chinese population.Big city hospitals were soon being swamped. Social media is full of images of hospital corridors packed with elderly patients on oxygen support.The real death toll is unknown. China´s health officials announced that they would not be counting deaths from other causes among the Covid statistics, even if coronavirus indirectly caused a patient to die by triggering other health problems. As a result, the official death toll is being ridiculed by Chinese people.One woman told the BBC about the death of her mother-in-law. Her story paints a picture of a funeral system under huge strain, suggesting the Covid death toll is considerable.First it was impossible to get an ambulance to rush her mother-in-law to hospital, she said. Then after she died her body was at one point stored on the floor in a room full of corpses.She said she had been told that Beijing had temporarily transformed a cold storage site so that it could accommodate bodies. It took more than a week for her family to get a slot at the crematorium for a funeral service and when we spoke to her they were still waiting for the cemetery to give them a location to place the urn containing her mother-in-law´s remains.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Hospitals like this one in Shanghai have struggled for space to put patients inIt is hard to convey the paradoxical mood in China right now. There are those who have lost loved ones or have had a bad dose of Covid - but there is also considerable joy because the country is re-opening. Government officials say many provinces and cities have passed the peak of infections.The new year mass migration has already started. You see people wheeling their luggage in the direction of the train stations, carrying gifts for their families. Tens of millions of people have already travelled with an estimated two billion trips expected.In Beijing´s Jianguomen district, a 53-year-old woman working in a little shop selling nuts told us she had not been home for the new year since the Covid crisis began. ""I can´t wait to go home. I´ve been working hard all year,"" she said. ""I want to see my parents who are getting old. My kids are there too. They´re all looking forward to my return. We can have a family reunion and ring in the new year together!""She says she feels guilty for being away from home for so long. Her 84-year-old father and 77-year-old mother have both caught the virus and recovered, as has she. So she said they could get on with normal life now.Young Chinese self-infect amid Covid fears for elderlyCelebrity deaths spark fears over China Covid tollA few doors down is a noodle restaurant and a couple in their 50s who work there are on their break. Their boss still hasn´t told them whether they can have time off to travel back to their hometown in the eastern Anhui province.They hadn´t been home in three years ether. ""We´ve lost a lot of money during the Covid crisis yet rent remains the same. So we just keep working.""Don´t they want to go home this year?""Of course, we´d love to but we don´t have the money,"" they say together. The woman explains that their restaurant being forced to close for dine-in services for months on end hit them hard financially.Image source, EPAImage caption, People are saying things will be better in the Year of the RabbitHave their parents, aged in their 80s and 90s, caught Covid?""They must have got it,"" the man says. ""There were no test kits in our hometown but they felt unwell, got a fever and coughed a lot. Took some medicine and recovered.""Outside the restaurant a mother with her six-year-old son tells us they won´t be leaving Beijing any time soon. Though they´ve had Covid they say they´re worried about catching it again in a second wave of infections.Further along the road there is a man with his son who have a completely different attitude. They´re in Beijing on holiday. Neither of them have caught Covid yet but they say they´re not worried. The father says his grandparents have already recovered from the virus back in their hometown in Zhengzhou, in central Henan province, and that they will be heading there soon for the Spring Festival.Images of rabbits are going up everywhere. They look cute and happy and seem to embody the optimism which is now spreading.It has been a tough few years in China but you´ll hear people saying that during the Year of the Rabbit things are going to be so much better.And who can blame them for looking forward to better times?Listen to Stephen McDonell´s report from Beijing on the BBC´s From Our Own CorrespondentRelated TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemicTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

How US Marines are being reshaped for China threat - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Iwo Jima Memorial in Washington DCThe US military commitment to the Pacific was underlined in a White House meeting between the leaders of the US and Japan. But behind the scenes, this renewed focus on Asia has sparked a fierce debate within one of its most fabled military forces, writes defence analyst Jonathan Marcus.A bitter family row has erupted in one of the US military´s most hallowed institutions, the US Marine Corps.A host of its former senior commanders are lining up to attack the current leadership over plans for its reinvention.At issue is a plan to adapt the service for a potential conflict against China - a plan dubbed Force Design 2030. Almost from its inception this plan has been under attack with a cohort of retired generals taking the unusual approach of going to the press to air their frustrations.Retired senior officers have been meeting regularly; speaking at seminars and think tanks; and devising their own alternative to a plan which they see as a disaster for the Marine Corps´ future. One prominent critic is the former US Navy Secretary and former Senator for Virginia, Jim Webb, who served as a Marine officer in the Vietnam War and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2015. Space Force opens first overseas base in S KoreaUS unveils new nuclear stealth bomberWriting in the Wall Street Journal, he described Force Design 2030 as ""insufficiently tested"" and ""intrinsically flawed"". He warned that the plan ""raised serious questions about the wisdom and long-term risk of dramatic reductions in force structure, weapons systems and manpower levels in units that would take steady casualties in most combat scenarios"".So what has got them all so upset? Launched in 2020 by the Marine Corps Commandant General David H Berger, the plan is intended to equip the Marines for a potential conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific region rather than counter-insurgency wars like Iraq and Afghanistan.The new plan sees the Marines as fighting dispersed operations across chains of islands. Units will be smaller, more spread out, but packing a much bigger punch through a variety of new weapons systems. Huge amphibious landings like in World War Two or massive deployments on land - like in Iraq - will probably be things of the past.Most unpopular is the plan to cut back on foot soldiers and give up all its tanks. Such proposals have led some critics to feel the Corps is turning its back on its past. While it has close ties with the US Navy it is a separate service which grew dramatically in World War Two and has taken a prominent role in recent campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Public perceptions of the Marine Corps are powerfully influenced by the World War Two experience. Anyone who has seen John Wayne in the 1949 feature film The Sands of Iwo Jima or the more recent mini-series The Pacific produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks will remember the large-scale amphibious operations; men storming ashore from landing craft and so on. Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Scene from The Pacific mini-seriesThis is not the way the new plan sees the Marines as fighting.Its traditional role as America´s military first responder, capable of taking on disparate challenges around the globe, is what critics believe could be compromised by the new plan with its clear focus upon China and the Indo-Pacific.So what exactly is in the plan?some infantry battalions - the foot soldiers - to be cut around three-quarters of its towed artillery batteries replaced by long-range rocket systemsseveral helicopter squadrons are being cutgiving up all of its tanksMoney for the new weapons systems, totalling $15.8 billion,  are to be funded by the cuts which amount to some  $18.2 billion.In addition to the new rocket artillery systems, there are to be new anti-shipping missiles that can be fired from land and new unmanned aerial systems. The goal is to equip and train the Marine Corps for a new kind of warfare that the fighting in Ukraine has already prefigured.  The primary guiding factor of Force Design 2030 is what the Marines´ Commandant refers to as distributed operations, breaking up large forces into widely distributed smaller units but ensuring that they have sufficient military punch to make a real difference. These principles are already being put into practice on Japan´s Okinawa islands near Taiwan, where the Marines stationed there will undergo a shake-up, according to US officials.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida meets US President Joe BidenMilitary specialist Mike O´Hanlon, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, rejects the central criticism that the new focus on China might impair Marine operations elsewhere. The Marines will go where they are ordered, he says, and the new strategy probably won´t impact on operations as much as some think. ""What really has mattered in this regard is the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years - THAT is the big change, irrespective of (and mostly before) General Berger´s vision was even developed.""Many commentators insist that change is essential if the Marines are to face up to the challenges of the modern battlefield. Dr Frank Hoffman - himself a former Marine officer - is now a Distinguished Research Fellow at the US National Defense University. ""I think the critics are looking backwards to a gloried past, and fail to see the strategic picture vis a vis China and technology in a really disappointing way,"" he says. Orphaned choirboy ended up a US naval hero´My father kept me a secret for 60 years´While the withdrawal of the Marines´ tanks has drawn particular criticism, Dr Hoffman believes it is the right course. There will still be plenty of armoured vehicles, he argues, just not ""the heavy tanks and their supporting cast of refuellers"". ""It´s an adaptation to cover a deeper area with a more accurate mix of firepower such as we are seeing in Ukraine. The Corps has used its aviation element to have this range in the past, and now it will have a mix of traditional artillery and a family of missiles that will increase the lethality and range of its fire support."" These are all steps that many would say are justified by the lessons from Ukraine.The utility and importance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); rocket artillery; and the ability to strike at great range with great accuracy have all been underlined in the Russia-Ukraine war and are very much part of the Marines´ new plans. But their envisaged battlefield is very different - not the forests and steppe lands of Ukraine but island chains reaching across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.Force Design 2030 is very much an evolving programme. There have already been changes and there will be more. And while the direction of travel has been established there are still huge problems to resolve, not least the logistical challenges posed by a force likely to be distributed over a vast area.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, US Marine Osprey lands in joint exercise with Japan in GotembaAmphibious shipping will play a key role here. And as Nick Childs, the Senior Fellow for Naval Forces and Maritime Security at the IISS in London explains, new kinds of ships are going to be needed. ""Just relying on their traditional large amphibious ships would leave them too vulnerable to the kinds of modern weaponry that they are likely to face"", he says. ""So new kinds of smaller ships in greater numbers will be vital, so that the Marine Corps can operate in a more agile and dispersed way.""But getting more ships is not going to be easy. Smaller ones can be built quickly and in a wide range of shipyards but not necessarily at the pace needed. The US Navy also needs significant numbers of new warships and it is far from clear that there are the funds or the ship-yard capacity needed.

China Covid: Beijing criticises 'political' rules for its tourists - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Spain is one of a number of countries to ask for a negative Covid test from Chinese arrivalsBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsThe Chinese government has suggested that travel restrictions imposed by several countries on Chinese arrivals are politically motivated - and has warned that it may retaliate. The US, India and the UK are among the nations that have introduced mandatory testing for arrivals from China. The country has recently seen a surge in Covid cases following the easing of its strict controls. And there are fears that cases and deaths are being vastly underreported. China´s last daily Covid update, on 24 December, reported fewer than 5,000 cases - but some analysts claim the daily caseload is already over two million, and could peak at almost four million this month.A lack of data - and China´s announcement that it was easing curbs on travel from 8 January - led to more than a dozen countries announcing Covid testing on arrivals from China.The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged China to share more real-time information and a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry on Tuesday said that Beijing was willing to ""improve communication with the world"".However, spokeswoman Mao Ning said the government was ""firmly opposed to attempts to manipulate the epidemic prevention and control measures for political purposes, and will take corresponding measures...according to the principle of reciprocity.""China´s borders have been largely closed since March 2020 - meaning few foreigners were able to enter and those that did had to undergo rigorous testing and quarantine. The European Union´s disease prevention agency and Australia´s Chief Medical Officer have both argued that high levels of vaccination and immunity reduce the threat that Covid poses. But despite that, countries - including some in the EU - have imposed testing for Chinese arrivals.""I think we´re performing our duty in protecting French people by asking for tests,"" France´s Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Tuesday.""We´re doing it while respecting the rules of the World Health Organization and we will continue to do it.""The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, has said an overwhelming number of member states favour introducing travel restrictions. France, Italy and Spain have already introduced their own measures but a decision on whether that will be extended to all EU countries is expected on Wednesday. The US has also defended its testing requirements, saying that its approach is based ""solely and exclusively on science"". It´s not the first time that Beijing has been at odds with the international community over the virus. It was first detected in Wuhan in central China in late 2019 and the government resisted attempts to investigate the origins.Meanwhile, China has on Tuesday rejected an offer from the European Union to supply an unspecified number of Covid-19 vaccines to help deal with the surge in cases, saying it has an ""adequate supply"".Official data shows China has given more than 3.4 billion doses - the vast majority of which are CoronaVac. The government has so far insisted in using only Chinese-made vaccines, which have been proven to be less effective than other Western-developed mRNA vaccines against the Omicron variant.

Industrial espionage: How China sneaks out America's technology secrets - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, GE turbine blades in FranceBy Nicholas YongBBC NewsIt was an innocuous-looking photograph that turned out to be the downfall of Zheng Xiaoqing, a former employee with energy conglomerate General Electric Power.According to a Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment, the US citizen hid confidential files stolen from his employers in the binary code of a digital photograph of a sunset, which Mr Zheng then mailed to himself. It was a technique called steganography, a means of hiding a data file within the code of another data file. Mr Zheng utilised it on multiple occasions to take sensitive files from GE.GE is a multinational conglomerate known for its work in the healthcare, energy and aerospace sectors, making everything from refrigerators to aircraft engines.The information Zheng stole was related to the design and manufacture of gas and steam turbines, including turbine blades and turbine seals. Considered to be worth millions, it was sent to his accomplice in China. It would ultimately benefit the Chinese government, as well as China-based companies and universities. Zheng was sentenced to two years in prison earlier this month. It is the latest in a series of similar cases prosecuted by US authorities. In November Chinese national Xu Yanjun, said to be a career spy, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for plotting to steal trade secrets from several US aviation and aerospace companies - including GE.It is part of a broader struggle as China strives to gain technological knowhow to power its economy and its challenge to the geopolitical order, while the US does its best to prevent a serious competitor to American power from emerging.The theft of trade secrets is attractive because it allows countries to ""leapfrog up global value chains relatively quickly - and without the costs, both in terms of time and money, of relying completely on indigenous capabilities"", Nick Marro of the Economist Intelligence Unit told the BBC.Last July FBI director Christopher Wray told a gathering of business leaders and academics in London that China aimed to ""ransack"" the intellectual property of Western companies so it can speed up its own industrial development and eventually dominate key industries. He warned that it was snooping on companies everywhere ""from big cities to small towns - from Fortune 100s to start-ups, folks that focus on everything from aviation, to AI, to pharma"".At the time, China´s then foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Mr Wray was ""smearing China"" and had a ""Cold War mentality"".´China seeks to topple our status´In the DOJ statement on Zheng, the FBI´s Alan Kohler Jr said China was targeting ""American ingenuity"" and seeking to ""topple our status"" as global leader.Zheng was an engineer specialising in turbine sealing technology and worked on various leakage containment technologies in steam turbine engineering. Such seals optimise turbine performance ""whether by increasing power or efficiency or extending the usable life of the engine"", the DOJ said.Gas turbines that power aircraft are central to the development of China´s aviation industry.  Aerospace and aviation equipment are among 10 sectors that the Chinese authorities are targeting for rapid development to reduce the country´s dependence on foreign technology and eventually surpass it. But Chinese industrial espionage is targeting a wide range of other sectors too.According to Ray Wang, founder and CEO of Silicon Valley-based consultancy Constellation Research, they include pharmaceutical development and nanotechnology - engineering and technology conducted at the nanoscale for use in areas such as medicine, textiles and fabrics and automobiles. A nanometre is a billionth of a meter. It also includes pharmaceuticals, bioengineering - mimicking biological processes for purposes such as the development of biocompatible prostheses and regenerative tissue growth.Mr Wang cited an anecdote by a former head of research and development for a Fortune 100 company, who told him that ""the person he entrusted the most"" - someone so close that their children grew up together - was eventually found to be on the payroll of the Chinese Communist Party.""He kindly explained to me that the spies are everywhere,"" he said. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China needs technological knowhow to power its economy and its challenge to the geopolitical orderIn the past industrial espionage from countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore was a concern, Mr Marro said. However once indigenous firms emerge as innovative market leaders in their own right - and so start to want to protect their own intellectual property - then their governments start passing legislation to take the issue more seriously. ""As Chinese firms have become more innovative over the past decade, we´ve seen a marked strengthening of domestic intellectual property rights protection in tandem,"" Mr Marro said.China has also gained expertise by making foreign companies hand over technology under joint venture agreements in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Despite complaints the Chinese government has always denied accusations of coercion. Hacking deal a ´joke´There have been attempts to rein in hacking specifically.In 2015 the US and China struck a deal in which both sides pledged not to carry out ""cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage"".By the following year, the US National Security Agency had accused the Chinese of violating the agreement, although it did acknowledge that the quantity of attempts to hack government and corporate data had dropped ""dramatically"". But observers say the deal´s overall impact has been minimal. Mr Wang said it was a ""joke"" due to a lack of enforcement. Chinese cyber-espionage in the US has been ""pervasive"" and extends to academic labs. ""It has been going on in every aspect of Western businesses,"" he told the BBC. However Lim Tai Wei from the National University of Singapore noted that there were no ""definitive uncontested studies"" on the extent of the phenomenon.""Some believe that there was a short dip in Chinese cyber espionage against the US, but resumed its former level thereafter. Others believe it failed due to the overall breakdown in US-China relations,"" he said.Meanwhile the US is now directly trying to block China´s progress in the key semiconductor industry - vital for everything from smartphones to weapons of war - saying China´s use of the technology poses a national security threat.In October, Washington announced some of the broadest export controls yet, requiring licences for companies exporting chips to China using US tools or software, no matter where they are made in the world. Washington´s measures also prevent US citizens and green card holders from working for certain Chinese chip companies. Green card holders are US permanent residents who have the right to work in the country.The US is beating China in the battle for chipsMr Marro says that while these measures will slow China´s technological advance, they will also accelerate China´s efforts to remove US and other foreign products from its tech supply chains. ""China has been trying to do this for years, with muted success, but these policy goals now command greater urgency as a result of the recent US controls,"" he said.  With China also invoking its own national security, the scramble for a technological edge between the world´s two biggest economies is only likely to intensify further.But Mr Wang reckons that the US still holds the advantage. ""My cyber-security friends tell me when they hack Chinese sites, the only worthwhile tech [they can find there] is US intellectual property,"" he said.Related TopicsSpyingChinaUnited StatesChina-US relationsTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Ukraine war: Zelensky wants Xi Jinping meeting following China's peace plan - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Zelensky said victory ""will inevitably await us""By George Wright & Jaroslav LukivBBC NewsUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he plans to meet China´s leader Xi Jinping to discuss Beijing´s proposals on ending the war in Ukraine.Speaking on the first anniversary of Russia´s full-scale invasion, he said the proposal signalled that China was involved in the search for peace.""I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,"" he said.China´s plan calls for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty.However, the 12-point document does not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and it also condemns the usage of ""unilateral sanctions"", in what is seen as a veiled criticism of Ukraine´s allies in the West. The Chinese authorities have so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky´s call for a summit with Mr Xi.Meanwhile, Russia hailed the Chinese peace proposals. ""We share Beijing´s views,"" the foreign ministry in Moscow said in a statement.Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Beijing was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia - a claim strongly denied by Beijing. On Friday, American media again reported that the Chinese government was considering sending drones and artillery shells to Moscow.Asked about the Chinese plan, US President Joe Biden told ABC News on Friday: ""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin´s applauding it, so how could it be any good?""I´ve seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,"" he added.China appears to be siding with Russia, though it would like to find a way of rescuing President Putin by arranging some kind of face-saving peace deal, says the BBC´s World Affairs Editor John Simpson. The Chinese proposals follow a visit by the country´s top diplomat Wang Yi to Moscow, where he met President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday.After the talks, Mr Wang was quoted by China´s state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that Beijing was willing to ""deepen political trust"" and ""strengthen strategic coordination"" with Moscow.Why China launched a charm offensive over UkraineWestern officials gave the latest proposals a lukewarm reception. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing ""doesn´t have much credibility"" because it had ""not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine"".President Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Russian troops made significant advances during the first few days in Ukraine´s north, east and south.But the attack on the capital Kyiv was soon repulsed and the Ukrainian military was later able to retake large areas.The conflict - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - has since become a grinding war of attrition.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsAt a lengthy news conference in Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky also said victory ""will inevitably await us"" if allies ""respect their promises and deadlines"".Poland said it had already delivered four German-made Leopard II tanks to Ukraine and was ready to deliver more. Germany has said it will provide 14 Leopard tanks, with Spain and Canada also sending tanks. The US - by far the biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine - has pledged to send 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks and the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks.The Ukrainian leader added that his country had failed to engage sufficiently with countries in Africa and Latin America after many nations in those continents abstained during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion. ""We didn´t work well for many years, we didn´t pay attention, I think it´s a big mistake,"" he said.Asked if he could name his worst moment of the war so far, Mr Zelensky said Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops are accused of having killed civilians in the early part of the war. The small town had been under Russian control until Ukrainian troops fought back last April to reclaim it.""What I saw. It was horrible,"" Mr Zelensky said, visibly moved.How Putin´s fate is tied to his war in UkraineChina´s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visit The US marked a year since Russia invaded Ukraine by announcing a new range of sanctions against Russia and new aid for Ukraine.The latest restrictions target more than 100 entities both within Russia and worldwide, including banks and suppliers of defence equipment. The US said it wanted to stop those helping Russia exploit loopholes to get sanctioned materials.The White House´s fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $12bn (£10bn), comprising $2bn from the Department of Defense including ammunition and drones and $10bn from the State Department including budgetary support to the Ukrainian government. A further $550m will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.Moldova is Europe´s poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.It comes days after US President Joe Biden flew to Kyiv for a surprise visit and held talks with Mr Zelensky.On Friday, the EU also approved its 10th round of sanctions against Russia, imposing restrictions on technology that has a civilian and military dual use.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingVolodymyr ZelenskyChinaMoldovaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64762219,25,02,2023,bbc,china
China: Northern city of Mohe reports coldest temperature - BBC News,"Related TopicsClimate changeImage source, Future Publishing/Getty ImagesImage caption, As Mohe is China´s northernmost city, it is often nicknamed ´China´s North Pole´By Kerry AllenBBC MonitoringChina´s northernmost city, Mohe, has recorded its lowest temperature since records began.  Mohe - known as ""China´s North Pole"" - is in the province of Heilongjiang, close to the Russian border.On Sunday, its local meteorological station recorded a record-low temperature of -53C (-63F) at 7am. The previous coldest temperature on record in the city was -52.3C, in 1969. However, the temperature is probably still shy of China´s national record.The coldest temperature ever recorded in China is -58C, in the city of Genhe, Inner Mongolia in December 2009, according to media reports of a visit by government meteorologists.Other records, however, have the 1969 cold snap in Mohe as the lowest - meaning Sunday´s -53C temperature could be China´s lowest ever.By contrast, the lowest temperature recorded in the UK is -27.2C, set in different parts of Scotland in 1895, 1982 and 1995.Mohe is no stranger to cold weather: China Daily says the city is regarded as the coldest  in China, and that its winter period ""usually lasts eight months"". As a result, it attracts tourists throughout the year with its ""North Pole"", ice and snow parks, and skiing venues. In previous years, it has also hosted winter marathons.  This time of year, it is common for the city to see average temperatures of -15C.  In the past week, China´s meteorological authority issued alerts for plunging temperatures and cold winds in the region. The Xinhua News Agency said a number of areas in the Greater Khingan mountain range, which spans Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang, saw new record low temperatures over the weekend.  Since Friday, temperatures dipped below -50C in Mohe for three consecutive days, which outlets have said is unprecedented.  Beijing News reported on Friday that coal consumption has increased by a third in the city, as the cold weather bites.  Car companies also told the paper they had taken advantage of the cold to test the braking performance of vehicles.  One resident told Kanji Video that his hands had been numb within 10 seconds of stepping outdoors, but that he had seen very few other people around.  ""It becomes hazy about 100m in front of you, you can´t see anyone,"" he said.A tourist, surnamed Li, told Beijing News that he had made a special trip from China´s southernmost province, Guangdong, to experience the extreme weather. ""I didn´t expect it to get below -50C this year, it was quite a surprise,"" he told the paper. Meanwhile, the official broadcaster, CCTV, showed a journalist breaking an egg on an outdoor surface - causing the egg to freeze within seconds.  More generally, the media are paying tribute to essential workers - including police officers, firefighters, soldiers and street cleaners - who are continuing to work outdoors during the cold. China has seen record temperatures over the past year, for heat as well as cold. Earlier this month, the Xinhua news agency said that the country had recorded the hottest summer and autumn in 60 years, with multiple cities breaking records. Climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather generally - and while scientists agree global temperatures are rising, that doesn´t mean we will stop having periods of very cold weather.Follow Kerry on Twitter: @kerrya11enImage source, CCTVImage caption, Chinese audiences have watched a cracked egg freeze within seconds on state TVRelated TopicsAsiaChinaBBC MonitoringClimate changeSevere weather",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64378176,23,01,2023,bbc,china
China Covid: Five deaths under country's new counting method - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: Ros Atkins on... China’s Covid surgeBy Thomas MackintoshBBC News, LondonChina has outlined the way it counts Covid-19 deaths amid scepticism about the real impact of the disease.It says the figure includes only those who die from respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia.Officially, there were only five Covid deaths on Tuesday, two on Monday - and none in the previous two weeks.The counting method goes against World Health Organization (WHO) guidance - resulting in a figure that is way below the death toll in many other countries.The WHO says countries use different processes to test and report Covid-19 deaths making comparisons between nations difficult.It is why many countries record Covid-19 deaths as excess mortality - how many more people died than would normally be expected based on death figures before the pandemic hit.These calculations also take into account deaths which were not directly because of Covid but were caused by its knock-on effects - including people being unable to access hospitals for the care they require.By contrast, China has strict criteria for confirming Covid-19 cases, which include evidence in patients of lung damage caused by the virus. This must be confirmed in a scan.But, the country is currently experiencing a surge in cases since the lifting of its most severe restrictions earlier this month. What is China´s policy and how many cases are there?Official figures show a relatively low number of new daily cases and deaths. This has led to fears the numbers are an underestimate due to a recent reduction in Covid testing.In a bid to address the concerns the State Council held a news conference on Tuesday.Infectious disease expert Prof Wang Gui-qiang clarified that only pneumonia and respiratory failure caused by the coronavirus were counted as Covid deaths. Deaths caused by underlying diseases are not included in the official count, state-owned China News Service reported.Strict lockdowns are said to account for China´s official death toll staying so low since the start of the pandemic - the official figure is just over 5,200.This is equal to only three Covid deaths in every million in China, compared with 3,000 per million in the US and 2,400 per million in the UK.China has faced challenges with vaccines being used and particularly getting them to the most vulnerable people.Overall, China says more than 90% of its population has been fully vaccinated. However, less than half of people aged 80 and over have received three doses of vaccine. Elderly people are more likely to suffer severe Covid symptoms.China has developed and produced its own vaccines, which have been shown to be less effective at protecting people against serious Covid illness and death than the mRNA vaccines used in much of the rest of the world.Prof Wang´s comments come as hospitals in the capital Beijing and in other cities struggle to cope with the latest Covid surge.The latest wave has also hit postal and catering services hard.Meanwhile, China´s largest city, Shanghai, has ordered most of its schools to take classes online as cases soar.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64044204,20,12,2022,bbc,china
The protesters who've gone missing as China deepens crackdown - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Many who took part in the November protests held up blank pieces of paper as a symbol of their frustrationBy Tessa Wong & Grace TsoiBBC News, SingaporeAs China declares victory over the pandemic, the landmark protests in November which spelled the end for zero-Covid rules have begun fading from memory.But as the country moved on, many of those who took part in the demonstrations went missing, taken by authorities in a quietly deepening crackdown on dissenters.Thousands rallied against restrictive Covid policies in the so-called White Paper protests, holding up blank white sheets in the dark. It was a rare show of criticism of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping.Police made few arrests at the time. Now, months on, scores of those protesters are in police custody, say Chinese activists, with one group estimating there have been more than 100 arrests.International rights groups and foreign universities have called for their release. And activist groups have published lists naming the alleged detainees. This includes those who protested in Beijing as well as other cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing. Chinese authorities have not responded to queries on the detentions. But through interviews with friends and lawyers, the BBC was able to verify the names of 12 people arrested in Beijing. At least five of them have been released on bail. Among those still in custody, four women - Cao Zhixin, Li Siqi, Li Yuanjing and Zhai Dengrui - have been formally arrested for ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"". This is a notoriously vague charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years, and one which critics say is often used to stifle dissent. ´They are not activists´Many of those arrested are well-educated - some attended universities in the UK and the US - and they include writers, journalists, a musician, a teacher and a financial industry professional. Most of the Beijing detainees were part of a loose network of friends who shared a love for the arts and often met at book clubs, movie screenings and discussions.Many of them are women, and according to reports, police have questioned them about whether they were feminists or involved in ""feminist activities"". Chinese authorities have increasingly cracked down on or censored women´s rights activists in recent years.Though the group was socially conscious, and some members had shown support for #MeToo figure Xianzi, they were not activists, their friends insisted.""They are just a group of young people concerned about society… my friend is interested not just in women´s rights, but also human rights and the rights of the vulnerable. This has nothing to do with feminist-related activities,"" said one of the detainees´ friends. On 27 November, several women from the group had joined a public vigil at Liangma River in Beijing. The event was one of many spontaneously held across China that night to mourn the victims of an apartment fire in Urumqi which had shocked China - many believed the victims could not escape because of Covid restrictions, though authorities disputed this.The vigil turned into a peaceful protest, with people holding blank pieces of paper that became a symbol of their frustration.""The environment has been so oppressive for so long. They didn´t think they were participating in a movement when they went. They thought it was just a way to vent their emotions,"" another friend said.""They didn´t clash with police or express radical opinions. So they didn´t think it was serious."" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The protest in Beijing began as a vigil to mourn the victims of an apartment fire in UrumqiSo much so that their friends say they did little to protect their identities, given how swiftly China is known to silence protests. It´s unclear what led police to this particular group of friends, but they have reportedly tracked down protesters using surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, and searched the phones of those arrested.One of the detainees created a Telegram group which expanded from several members to more than 60. And many of them used phone numbers registered under their real names. Two days later, some of them were questioned by police. ""We were talking on the phone when she was being taken away,"" said the boyfriend of one detainee. ""She told me some of her friends were being taken away and lost contact. She was trying to delete stuff from her mobile phone. She was taken away before she finished deleting things.""The US rape accusation that transfixed ChinaFury and questions over China´s treatment of womenThe arrests appeared to accelerate through December and January as, one by one, more friends were detained, according to activists.Cao Zhixin, in anticipation of her arrest, sent her friends a video of herself speaking to the camera. It came with the instructions to publish it online in the event of her disappearance.""What we did was express our feelings in a reasonable way,"" Ms Cao said in the clip, which has now gone viral. ""We don´t want to disappear… if attending a mourning event is a crime, how much room is left for sharing our feelings?Concern and condemnationSeveral human rights groups and educational institutions are now calling for their release in a sign of growing international concern. British university Goldsmiths confirmed to the BBC that Li Siqi was a former student, and said it was ""deeply concerned"" for her welfare.""We condemn in the strongest terms the suppression of free speech and urge the Chinese authorities to immediately release all those who are being detained in relation to the vigil,"" a Goldsmiths spokeswoman said.She added that the university´s warden had written to the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Zheng Zeguang. The Chinese embassy is yet to respond to queries from the BBC.The University of Chicago and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) also confirmed that their former students had been arrested. A UNSW statement to the BBC called for the matter to be resolved with ""due respect for legal principles and for universal human rights"". Reporters Without Borders noted that four of the detainees including Li Siqi were journalists, and called their arrests ""one more chilling message to those who believe that factual information should be reported even when it contradicts the official narrative"".Human Rights Watch said the incident showed that ""young people in China are paying a heavy price for daring to speak out for freedom and human rights"", adding that Chinese authorities have threatened lawyers and friends who have tried to support the detainees.Killing the chickenObservers believe authorities want to send a signal with the arrests, or what rights activist Teng Biao calls ""killing the chicken to scare the monkeys"".""They want to get who they believe are the leaders and organisers, and those who play a leading role will be severely punished,"" he said, adding that the Chinese authorities´ instinct will be to find out if ""Western hostile forces"" were behind the protests.The fact that a significant number of the detainees are women, and have been reportedly questioned about supporting feminist causes, also underscores the officials´ distrust of the women´s rights movement.China in recent years has been roiled by several high-profile cases involving female victims of violence and sexual assault. These have triggered unusually harsh criticism of the authorities and have marshalled support for women´s rights. But as the movement grows, the government´s response has hardened. In 2015, it cracked down on a group of women known as the Feminist Five, and since then activists say they have been increasingly censored and attacked online. An arm of the Chinese Communist Party recently condemned ""extreme feminism"" as an ""malignant tumour"".""Maintaining ´social harmony´ has always been the government´s top priority, and feminist movements have always been considered a threat to the stability of the entire political system,"" said Altman Peng, an assistant professor at the University of Warwick who studies Chinese gender power relations.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Activists hope growing international condemnation will lead to the release of detained protestersIt is unclear what lies ahead for the protesters. Those out on bail are still liable to be charged. Those who remain in custody could be detained for several weeks as prosecutors decide whether to charge them - but that could stretch to months, if not years, in political cases, according to Mr Teng.Their families have so far remained silent, and some have cut off contact with the detainees´ friends. The BBC has learnt that one family also dropped a lawyer they had hired to fight their daughter´s case, although it is not clear why.The detainees´ families are likely to stay silent given the immense pressure they are under, says veteran rights activist Yang Zhanqing.""The police has a carrot and stick approach. Authorities would tell the families that those arrested would be released early if they kept silent. If they didn´t comply, they would lose their jobs and pension."" But increasing international scrutiny of the detentions may also aid those in custody. In such politically sensitive cases, detainees can be released early or receive better treatment in jail because of external pressure, Mr Yang says. Meanwhile, friends of the detainees, anxious and worried for their own personal safety, continue to keep tabs on the situation and share information. Many of them live overseas and did not attend the November protests, but they fear they may be targeted anyway because of their association with the detainees - and their attempts to raise international awareness of their friends´ plight.

India targets China's dominance in mobile phones - BBC News,"Image source, Deepa AswaniImage caption, Finding the right phone at the right price was a mission for Deepa AswaniBy Priti Gupta in Mumbai & Ben Morris in LondonReportingBuying a new smartphone was a bit of a mission for Deepa Aswani, who works in marketing in Mumbai.""I am very particular about what phone I buy. I did not want to invest too much,"" she says.After two months of deliberation, she chose the OnePlus 10R, which in a sale cost her $400 (£329), a reasonable price for a smartphone, but still a significant sum in any country, and particularly in a developing one like India.""The idea was to buy a phone which did not make a hole in my pocket and had good features. I am happy with the phone I have purchased,"" she says.Ms Aswani´s new smartphone was made by a Chinese firm in India - a common arrangement these days.But as recently as 2014, the majority of phones sold in India would have been imported. That has all changed in recent years. In 2022 almost all phones sold in India were made there as well, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA).Many of those phones would have been made by overseas firms with operations in India, like Taiwan´s Foxconn or South Korea´s Samsung.But the number of home-grown firms is increasing rapidly.Image source, MicromaxImage caption, Micromax has become one of India´s biggest makers of mobile phonesMicromax Informatics is one of those challengers. It entered the mobile handset business in 2008. In just two years it grew to become one of India´s biggest makers of cheaper phones, known as feature phones. Despite that growth, Micromax co-founder Rajesh Agarwal says it is hard to compete with Chinese smartphone makers.When his firm launches a new phone, he can hope to sell about a million units in India. But a Chinese phone maker can sell 10 million phones, or more, which gives them a big cost advantage.""They have huge strength in terms of production,"" he says.On top of that, Chinese firms can source almost all of their components locally.India does make some parts, including chargers, cables and batteries, but the more sophisticated parts, like screens and computer chips are almost always made abroad.Image source, MicromaxImage caption, Micromax co-founder Rajesh Agarwal says India needs to make all the components that go into a phone""As far as the manufacturing is concerned - it is the beginning. We have to become our own kitchen where we are able to produce all our components locally,"" says Mr Agarwal.""The final goal would be to transition from being a producer for domestic consumption to serving global demand, not just for phones but laptops, tablets and other devices,"" he adds.The Indian government is hoping to accelerate that move. In April 2021 it launched the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Telecom and Networking Equipment.It is the latest part of a government policy, which goes back years, aiming to increase all types of manufacturing in India.The PLI scheme subsidises mobile phone components that are made in India. It is hoped that will make them more competitive and boost production.According to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), at the moment between 15% and 20% of the parts that make up an Indian phone are made in India. The aim of the PLI scheme is to raise that to between 35% and 40%.Image source, MicromaxImage caption, At the moment only about 20% of components in Indian phones are made in India""The production-linked incentive scheme is a game changer for electronics manufacturing,"" says ICEA chairman Pankaj Mohindroo.""India is currently one of the fastest growing mobile phone manufacturers in the world and has emerged as the second largest manufacturer of mobile handsets in the world,"" he says.Mobile phones are the biggest single component of India´s electronic exports and next year are expected to make up 50% of electronics exports, according to the ICEA.""India will become the next global hub for cell phone manufacturers,"" predicts Hari Om Rai, the chairman of Indian phone maker Lava International.  He points out that China, as it has become richer and seen wages rising, has lost some of the cost advantage that it had over other nations.More technology of business:Tech trends 2023: Flying taxis and satellite phonesThe cargo hauling aircraft with no pilots on boardSkilled tech workers snapped up despite downturnTropical vineyards put India on the wine mapSecond-hand tech booms as shoppers look for bargainsAlso, Mr Om Rai says firms all over the world are worried about becoming overly reliant on products from China. And the disruption at Apple´s key supplier in the city of Zhengzhou is unlikely to have lessened those worries.If firms want to locate manufacturing elsewhere then, according to Mr Om Rai, India is an attractive option.""India has 18% of the world´s population, with a mere 3.1% of the GDP. As the country´s GDP grows, it will become one of the world´s largest markets. Looking at the long-term potential, every company is trying to establish itself and outcompete its competitors in India,"" he says.Back in Mumbai, all this industrial policy is of little interest to Deepa Aswani.""It does not bother me where my smartphone is manufactured. I think as a consumer all that matters is budget and features,"" she says. ""As a smartphone buyer I would look at the country which has advanced technology and is pocket friendly.""Related TopicsMobile phonesIndiaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

China balloon: US shoots down airship over Atlantic - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Video appears to show China balloon shot downThe US has shot down a giant Chinese balloon that it says has been spying on key military sites across America.The Department of Defence confirmed its fighter jets brought down the balloon over US territorial waters.China´s foreign ministry later expressed ""strong dissatisfaction and protest against the US´s use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft"".Footage on US TV networks showed the balloon falling to the sea after a small explosion.An F-22 jet fighter engaged the high-altitude balloon with one missile - an AIM-9X Sidewinder - and it went down about six nautical miles off the US coast at 14:39 EST (19:39 GMT), a defence official told reporters.Defence officials told US media the debris landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.The military is now trying to recover debris which is spread over seven miles (11km). Two naval ships, including one with a heavy crane for recovery, are in the area.In a Pentagon statement a senior US defence official said that ""while we took all necessary steps to protect against the PRC [China] surveillance balloon´s collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloon´s overflight of US territory was of intelligence value to us. ""We were able to study and scrutinise the balloon and its equipment, which has been valuable,"" the official added.US President Joe Biden had been under pressure to shoot it down since defence officials first announced they were tracking it on Thursday.Afterwards, Mr Biden said: ""They successfully took it down, and I want to compliment our aviators who did it.""In a statement a few hours later, the Chinese foreign ministry said: ""The Chinese side has repeatedly informed the US side after verification that the airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident."" The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off this weekend´s trip to China over the ""irresponsible act"". The Chinese authorities have denied it is a spying aircraft, and instead said it was a weather ship blown astray. Balloon saga deflates efforts to mend US-China relationsWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?Reacting to the incident, Taiwan´s foreign ministry said in a statement: ""The Chinese Communist Party government´s actions that violate international law and violate the airspace and sovereignty of other countries should not be tolerated in a civilised international community.""China considers self-ruled Taiwan a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing´s control. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve this.But Taiwan sees itself as independent, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.President Biden first approved the plan to down the balloon on Wednesday, but the Pentagon said it had decided to wait until the object was over water so as not to put people on the ground at undue risk.Groundwork for the operation was laid when the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast on Saturday afternoon because of a ""national security effort"". The coast guard also advised mariners to leave the area due to military operations ""that present a significant hazard"". An eyewitness on the coast, Hayley Walsh, told BBC News she saw three fighter jets circling before the missile was fired, then ""we heard a huge boom, the house shook"".This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China rowOne senior military official told CNN the recovery of debris should be ""fairly easy"" and could take ""relatively short time"". The official added that ""capable Navy divers"" could be deployed to assist in the operation.Defence officials also revealed on Saturday the balloon had first entered US airspace on 28 January near the Aleutian Islands, before moving to Canadian airspace three days later, and re-entering the US on 31 January. The object was spotted in the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.Relations between China and the US have been exacerbated by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an ""unacceptable violation"" of US sovereignty.Mr Blinken - America´s top diplomat - told Beijing it was ""an irresponsible act"" ahead of his now-cancelled trip on 5-6 February - it would have been the first such high level US-China meeting there in years.But China sought to play down the cancellation of his visit, saying in a statement on Saturday that neither side had formally announced a plan for a trip. China´s foreign ministry said Beijing ""would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype"" and accused ""some politicians and media in the United States"" of using the incident ""as a pretext to attack and smear China.""On Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.Colombia´s Air Force says an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country´s airspace at above 55,000ft.It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.China has not yet commented publicly on the reported second balloon.Related TopicsSpyingAntony BlinkenChinaUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64524105,05,02,2023,bbc,china
Taiwan charges ex-MP and former admiral with spying for China - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Taiwan has charged two former officials for violating anti-espionage lawBy Joel GuintoBBC NewsTaiwan has charged two former state officials with violating the national security law by organising meetings between former senior military officers and Chinese intelligence personnel.Those encounters allegedly allowed the Chinese to ""contact and even recruit"" ex-military officers to their network.Prosecutors say the pair arranged 13 free trips to mainland China for 48 former officers from 2013 to 2018.The men earlier denied they were recruiting spies for China. The meetings also promoted China´s unification with Taiwan, prosecutors say.Retired rear admiral Hsia Fu-hsiang and ex-MP Lo Chih-ming face up to five years in jail if convicted.China considers self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province and has vowed to place it under its control, by force if necessary.Taiwan´s strongest ally, the US, warned in October that China is pursuing unification at a much faster timeline. At around the same time, China´s leader Xi Jinping embarked on a historic third term as head of both the Communist Party and the military.Beijing and Taipei have spied on each other since the end of a civil war in 1949 that saw the Communist Party take control of the mainland while nationalists settled on Taiwan island.Prosecutors say Mr Hsia and Mr Lo have been involved with Chinese organisations that advocate for unification since 2013. The two men have been detained since January.But there is no evidence showing the retired officers who joined these trips collected confidential information for China, so they are listed as witnesses, prosecutors say. Their names surfaced as prosecutors investigated an air force colonel who allegedly recruited at least six current members of the Taiwanese navy and air force on behalf of China for over eight years. ""We urge retired military officers to exercise caution regarding unreasonable benefits when they go to events in China to avoid falling into the traps"" of Beijing, prosecutors say.A number of former high-ranking Taiwan military officials have been accused of aiding Chinese intelligence in recent years.In January, a retired air force major general was found guilty of accepting meals and trips from a Hong Kong businessman who was acting on behalf of Beijing. However, his sentence was suspended since he showed remorse and had no previous criminal record.Related TopicsAsiaChinaTaiwanMilitary",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64985532,17,03,2023,bbc,china
TikTok users shrug at China fears: 'It's hard to care' - BBC News,"Image source, Liz BarrImage caption, Liz Barr says she was annoyed when her university blocked TikTok, but it hasn´t stopped her using itBy Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New YorkTikTok has been banned on government networks and devices in the US, Canada and the European Union. But are the moves having any effect?When TikTok would not load on her university´s wi-fi network earlier this year student Liz Barr was stymied - but not for long. She soon figured ways around the block using personal mobile data or a virtual private network (VPN). The block had been introduced after state officials in Maryland banned the video app on government networks, citing national security concerns. ""I was annoyed, because I live here and I get bored,"" says the 18-year-old, who is studying computer science and creative writing at St Mary´s College of Maryland. ""But now it works, so it´s not that big of a problem."" The workaround shows the quandary facing the US and other countries as they threaten to crack down on TikTok, which has exploded in global popularity in recent years offering an endless feed of user-generated makeup tutorials, life hacks, silly dances, and other confessionals curated by algorithm.Rumbling against the social media platform, which is owned by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance and has more than one billion users globally, has reached new pitch in recent months. Concerns have been especially loud in the US, where politicians from across the ideological spectrum are urging steps to curtail its reach, arguing that the data TikTok collects could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans or influence political debates.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Ros Atkins on... The creeping TikTok bansDozens of states, like Maryland, have banned TikTok on government networks and devices, moves that affect access in public libraries, universities and elsewhere.TikTok´s chief executive is due to appear this month in Congress, which is debating various proposals that could result in a wider national ban, while the company remains in a years-long negotiation with the White House about what changes it could make to satisfy the security concerns.But among the app´s prime users in the US - people aged under 25 - the general frenzy has done little to dent use, if they´re aware of it at all.At the University of Oklahoma, which announced it was blocking the app on the campus wi-fi in December, students were surprised and annoyed but ""people were pretty quick to figure it out and navigate it,"" says student body president Christopher Firch, noting that most people can simply switch from wi-fi to a personal mobile data plan to get around the ban. ""I don´t want to negate a national security issue... but I just think people are like, ´this sucks´ and then laugh about it,"" he says. ""They´re not taking it super, super seriously.""TikTok answers three cyber-security fears about appChina hits out as US bans TikTok on federal devicesTikTok sets daily screen time limit for under-18sAmong the American public broadly speaking, support for a ban on TikTok has been rising.In December, 53% of adults in the US favoured a national ban on Chinese-owned social media apps, according to decision intelligence company Morning Consult. That compares to just 29% who said they supported blocking TikTok in 2020 when US President Donald Trump took steps to ban TikTok and WeChat - moves that were later blocked in court. But Americans aged 18-25 are less likely than older adults to be concerned about competition with China and more likely to distrust the US government, says Jordan Marlatt, tech industry analyst at Morning Consult. They also have more positive views of social media.Less than a third favoured banning Chinese social media apps, Morning Consult´s survey found.Image caption, Iniko Thornell says it is hard for her to see the risks of TikTok as being greater than other appsLiz, the student in Maryland, says she is already giving up personal data to many other apps and is sceptical that her information would be useful, even if it were accessed. ""To me, I can understand banning it at government places because those are more sensitive,"" she says. ""But I´m not important enough as a college student with eight cents to my name.""""It´s hard to care about one [social media company] and not care about all of them,"" says Iniko Thornell, 25, who works in New York City and has been on the app for about two years. ""I don´t think anything on my TikTok is that important,"" she adds. Even those like 21-year-old Kate Nazzaro, who have quit TikTok, say their concerns were unrelated to national security. Rather, she says, ""I thought it was bad for my brain.""Image caption, Kate Nazzaro says she quit TikTok, worried about its impact on her mental health, not national securityTikTok has said it strictly limits who can access American user information and would not provide data to the Chinese government if asked. It says a ban would have ""the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans"" and the US should instead approve a deal under negotiation in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which would store data of American users in the US and create other oversight. But at a time of heightened anti-China sentiment in Washington, the firm´s assurances have failed to persuade lawmakers, who have put forward a number of proposals aimed at curbing the app and are expected to give chief executive Shou Zi Chou a tough grilling on 23 March. The popularity of TikTok, a tech giant from outside of Silicon Valley, has brought home to the US questions that other countries have long faced about what governments should do to protect their citizens´ data, says Timothy Edgar, a professor of computer science at Brown University who advised former President Barack Obama on cyber security issues. He says lawmakers are rightfully sceptical of TikTok´s claims, but a ban would do little to address the worries, noting that many social media apps collect and sell data on users and are vulnerable to efforts by foreign countries to influence political debate. A ban is also unworkable without far bigger changes to the way the internet is run in the US, says Bruce Schneier, a security technologist and author.""It´s easy to say your employees can´t use it on government computers but those teenagers... we cannot stop them - it´s not going to work,"" he says, noting that the internet as it stands was designed to be open. ""We just don´t have that ability.""He adds: ""We´ve built an internet where spying is the business model and at this point, we can´t pick and choose who gets to spy.""Image source, Colin ReaImage caption, Colin Rea has 2.7 million followers on TikTokFor now, the general shrug from Generation Z seems to be in part a bet that the threats will not result in action anytime soon.TikTok personality Colin Rea, who has built a following of 2.7 million for his posts about rebuilding his life after prison, recently posted a video urging fans to join him on alternate platforms, worried about losing his livelihood if a ban moves forward.He´s not the only one to do so, but he told the BBC for now concerns about a ban seem far more muted than in 2020, when furore erupted in response to Mr Trump´s orders.""I think there would be more discussion if we hadn´t already been in this position so many times,"" he says.Related TopicsTikTokUS governmentCyber-security",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64827885,13,03,2023,bbc,china
India Covid: Experts say people don't need to panic over China coronavirus surge - BBC News,"Related TopicsIndia coronavirus lockdownImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus casesBy Meryl SebastianBBC News, KochiExperts have told the BBC that the current Covid surge in China is ""unlikely"" to impact India, but they urged people to stay cautious and wear masks.India has stepped up surveillance after a spike in cases in neighbouring China.People travelling from China and four other Asian countries now have to produce a Covid-19 negative test report before entering India.On Tuesday, drills were held to check if hospitals could handle a surge.According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases. But reports of the surge in China and the memories of two deadly Covid waves in 2020 and 2021 in India have made many people fearful.But experts say there is no reason to worry right now.""The infection surge in China is on expected lines. If you have a susceptible population that is not exposed to the virus, cases will rise. Nothing has changed for the rest of the world, including India,"" says Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist. China has been struggling with a rush of Covid cases after it started moving away from its so-called zero-Covid approach which mandated strict lockdowns, quarantining and closed borders. The country is now trying to ramp up vaccinations for its vulnerable elderly population as the case surge strains healthcare systems.The surge has also led some experts raising doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - can provide long-term immunity.""People are getting infected because BF.7 [the Omicron subvariant that reports say is driving the surge in China] is highly infectious and escapes all previous immunity. If you don´t have immunity, you get more diseases which will affect the elderly and immunosuppressed populations,"" says virologist Dr Jacob John.Over the past few months, India reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7 - all the patients have recovered, health officials say.""Covid is still around, people are still getting infected and getting admitted to hospitals. So it´s not that we´re free of Covid, but it´s become like another upper respiratory tract infection, like influenza,"" says epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant.The low caseload in India can be largely attributed to the immunity Indians have already gained over the past three years.Dr A Fathahudeen, a prominent critical care expert who has treated thousands of Covid patients, says that India´s ""hybrid immunity wall"" against Covid-19 is ""satisfactory"" as a majority of people have either taken two doses of the vaccine or gained natural immunity from contracting the disease earlier.He also points out that the vaccines used in India are ""more efficacious than the ones used in China"".India has administered more than 2.2 billion doses of the Covid vaccine so far, including for both doses and the booster shot, which India calls a ""precaution dose"".He says people should take the booster dose if they haven´t already - only around 27% of the population have got it so far. It´s an appeal that other experts broadly agree with.""With time, the level of antibodies go down. So a third shot is always beneficial and will increase the level of antibodies,"" Dr Lahariya says, adding that it´s good for people above 60 years of age.""Among the 18-59 year age group, those who are high-risk can get boosters. For others, it´s a personal call,"" he adds.Experts also agree with the government´s decision to step up genome sequencing which allows scientists to identify new strains.""The current testing strategy of random genome sequencing of 2% of international travellers is enough to pick up any new variant,"" says Dr Fathahudeen.Dr John says that the best mantra for the government and ordinary people to follow is ""expect the best and prepare for the worst"".""Make it a habit to wear masks in crowded places - watching a football or cricket match, or on a crowded bus or train,"" he says, adding that he recommends creating ""long-term, sustainable behavioural changes"".India had relaxed its mask-wearing rules earlier this year after a drop in infection levels, and it´s now common to see people in crowded areas without any precautions.The bottom-line is ""be cautious, wear a mask and watch the news"", Dr John says. Dr Fathahudeen agrees, saying unnecessary crowding should be discouraged and people should wear masks if large gatherings can´t be avoided.

China discusses military budget while warning of escalating threats - BBC News,"Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesBy George WrightBBC NewsChina says it will increase military spending by more than 7% this year, while warning of ""escalating"" threats.It was announced at the National People´s Congress (NPC), a rubber-stamp parliament, which is due to confirm President Xi Jinping´s third term.Beijing´s stated military budget - around $225bn (£186bn) - is dwarfed by that of the United States, which is four times greater. But analysts believe China downplays how much it spends on defence. In the past decade, China´s defence budget has risen by about 10% each year, with 2014 seeing the highest increase of 12.2%. The ""external attempts to suppress and contain China are escalating"", according to Outgoing Premier Li Keqiang´s government work report. ""The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board,"" the report said. It was also announced at the meeting that China would pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year.The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.But this year´s sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions.This week´s NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi´s leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party re-elected him as their leader for a third term.The increase in military spending comes as Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.US officials have also repeatedly warned that China may invade Taiwan in the coming years. China has held ever-growing displays of military force in the air and seas around Taiwan, including the firing of ballistic missiles.China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing´s control. The NPC will also unveil the new premier, China´s equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi´s most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. China´s Two Sessions: The basicsThe Two Sessions in Beijing are the annual meetings of China´s legislature and top political advisory body which attract thousands of representatives from across the countryThe National People´s Congress is the country´s equivalent of a parliament that is, in theory, the most powerful state organ. In reality it acts as a rubber-stamp body for the ruling Chinese Communist Party, passing key laws on decisions that have already been made The Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which has no real legislative power, draws its members from various sectors of society.

Two Sessions: China looks at reforms to deepen Xi Jinping control - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Xi will be elected president of China and head of the armed forcesBy Tessa WongBBC News, Asia Digital ReporterXi Jinping is set to deepen his control of China´s government and economy, as lawmakers meet in Beijing to pass far-reaching reforms.The National People´s Congress (NPC), a rubber-stamp parliament, will confirm Mr Xi´s third term as president, and the appointments of his top team. They will also name a new premier, the second-in-command after Mr Xi, as the incumbent Li Keqiang departs.The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.But this year´s sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions. They will also tighten control over bodies overseeing the finance sector and scientific and technology work, while ""strengthening party-building work"" in private businesses, according to state media.The moves will likely further blur the lines between the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and consolidate the party´s control of the private sector.This comes amid an ongoing corruption crackdown which has seen a string of high-profile businessmen disappear in recent years. The latest person to go missing was one of China´s top dealmakers in the tech sector.China´s Two Sessions: The basicsThe Two Sessions in Beijing are the annual meetings of China´s legislature and top political advisory body which attract thousands of representatives from across the countryThe National People´s Congress is the country´s equivalent of a parliament that is, in theory, the most powerful state organ. In reality it acts as a rubber-stamp body for the ruling Chinese Communist Party, passing key laws on decisions that have already been made The Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which has no real legislative power, draws its members from various sectors of society. Their debates are worth noting for emerging social and economic issuesThis week´s NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi´s leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party re-elected him as their leader for a third term. It was a break from decades-long tradition, as no other party leader besides Communist China´s first leader, Mao Zedong, will have served for this long. In the 2018 NPC meeting, lawmakers had approved the removal of term limits on the presidency, effectively allowing Mr Xi to remain leader for life.Mr Xi´s appointment comes as he faces domestic pressure to turn around an economy battered by his zero-Covid strategy and crackdowns in various business sectors.At the start of the meeting, it was announced that China will pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year, while defence spending is to rise by more than 7%.Abroad, Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.Xi Jinping´s power grab - and why it mattersXi´s path to a historic third term, explainedXi Jinping´s party is just getting startedThe NPC will also unveil the new Premier, China´s equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi´s most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. As the Shanghai party secretary, he oversaw a prolonged and painful Covid lockdown that angered locals and made international headlines. Outgoing premier Li Keqiang, who was ousted in the leadership reshuffle at October´s party congress, will deliver his last work report speech. The political appointments for the rest of the Politburo Standing Committee, the equivalent of Mr Xi´s cabinet, will also be announced.Many will be watching to see who fills several key positions, such as the commerce minister, head of the national development and reform commission, propaganda chief, and head of state security.Observers say the team was picked more for their loyalty to Mr Xi and the party, rather than for their expertise.Who are the men who rule China now?Related TopicsXi JinpingAsiaChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64819857,05,03,2023,bbc,china
China country profile - BBC News,"China is the world´s most populous country. It has a continuous culture stretching back nearly 4,000 years and originated many of the foundations of the modern world.   The People´s Republic of China was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang, who retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the People´s Republic on the mainland and the Republic of China on Taiwan.After stagnating for decades under the rigid totalitarian socialism of founder Mao Zedong, China reformed its economy along partly-capitalist lines to make it one of the world´s fastest-growing, as well a leading exporter. China is now a major overseas investor, and is pursuing an increasingly assertive foreign and defence policy far beyond East Asia.But economic change has not been matched by political reform, and the Communist Party retains a tight grip on political life and much of wider society.See more country profiles - Profiles compiled by BBC MonitoringPEOPLE´S REPUBLIC OF CHINA: FACTSCapital: BeijingArea: 9,596,961 sq kmPopulation: 1.41 billionLanguages:  Mandarin Chinese, also Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Zhuang and othersLife expectancy: 74 years (men) 79 years (women)LEADERSPresident: Xi JinpingImage source, Getty ImagesXi Jinping came to power in 2012-3 as the hand-picked heir of predecessor Hu Jintao, and is expected to lead China into the next decade.Since taking over he has concentrated power in his hands, rather than sticking with the traditional post-Mao system of collective leadership.His position as the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong was cemented in 2017, when his name and political philosophy was written into the Communist Party constitution.In early 2018 the party allowed him to remain in office indefinitely by abolishing the conventional two-term presidential limit. President Xi rejects constitutional democracy and human rights as models for China, has imposed strict limits on freedom of expression, especially on social media, and tightened control over Hong Kong.He has also subjected the whole country to strict lockdowns as part of a controversial Zero Covid policy, while incarcerating thousands of Muslim Uighurs in brutal ""re-education camps"".MEDIAImage source, AFPImage caption, China has the world´s biggest internet audience, but content is tightly controlledChina is the largest media market in the world.Outlets operate under tight Communist Party control.

China refuses to condemn Russia's Ukraine invasion during G20 deadlock - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersBy Oliver SlowBBC NewsFinance ministers of the world´s largest economies have failed to agree on a closing statement following a summit in India, after China refused to condemn Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.Beijing declined to accept parts of a G20 statement that deplored Russia´s aggression ""in the strongest terms"".Moscow said ""anti-Russian"" Western countries had ""destabilised"" the G20.It comes after China this week published a plan to end the conflict that was viewed by some as pro-Russian. India, which hosted this week´s G20 talks in the southern city of Bengaluru, issued a wide-ranging ""chair´s summary"" from the meeting, noting there were ""different assessments of the situation"" in Ukraine, and on sanctions imposed on Russia.A footnote said that two paragraphs summarising the war were ""agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China"". The paragraphs were adapted from the G20 Bali Leaders´ Declaration in November, and criticised ""in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine"".After taking a back seat since the invasion a year ago, Beijing has stepped up its diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in recent weeks. Its top diplomat Wang Yi toured Europe this week, culminating in a warm welcome by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.China also this week published a 12-point plan for ending the war in Ukraine, in which it called for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty. However, the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and did not condemn Russia´s invasion.The Chinese document was welcomed by Russia, prompting US President Joe Biden to comment: ""[President] Putin´s applauding it, so how could it be any good?""Zelensky wants to meet China´s Xi to discuss peace planWhy China launched a charm offensiveAfter the G20 meeting, Ajay Seth, a senior Indian official, said in a press conference that Russian and Chinese representatives did not agree to the wording on Ukraine because ""their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues"". ""On the other hand, all the other 18 countries felt that the war has got implications for the global economy"" and needed to be mentioned, he added. The 17-paragraph summary of the summit also referenced the recent earthquake in Turkey, debt in low- and middle-income countries, global tax policy, and food insecurity.Russia´s foreign ministry said it regretted the fact that ""the activities of the G20 continue to be destabilised by the Western collective and used in an anti-Russian... way"". It accused the United States, European Union and G7 nations of ""clear blackmail"", urging them to ""acknowledge the objective realities of a multipolar world"". But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: ""This is a war. And this war has a cause, has one cause, and that is Russia and Vladimir Putin. That must be expressed clearly at this G20 finance meeting."" Previous meetings of G20 members have also failed to produce a joint statement since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. On Thursday, the UN General Assembly in New York overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warChinaRussiaIndiaG20",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64773618,25,02,2023,bbc,china
Shanghai schools to go online as Covid spreads in China - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, AFPImage caption, Students pictured in a school classroom in Shanghai in 2020By Alys DaviesBBC NewsChina´s largest city, Shanghai, has ordered most of its schools to take classes online as Covid cases soar.Nurseries and childcare centres will also shut from Monday, according to Shanghai´s education bureau.Restrictions were eased by Chinese authorities earlier this month following a wave of protests targeting China´s zero-Covid strategy.But the easing of strict lockdown measures has led to growing concerns over the spread of Covid in China.How is China tackling Covid?A quick guide to China´s Covid rule changesSignificant changes in the country´s Covid testing and reporting systems have made it difficult to know just how widespread the virus has become, with data for the week ending 11 December showing a fall in the total number of new infections across the country after peaking the previous week.But prior to the change in data collection, the number of cases was higher than that of the last Covid wave in April.Hospitals and medical facilities have come under increasing strain, with temporary health centres and intensive care facilities being set up across the country.In Shanghai, it has been reported that an extra 230,000 hospital beds have been made available.Some schools in the city have also already stopped in-person classes because teachers and staff are ill.In a statement posted on Chinese social media site WeChat on Saturday, Shanghai´s education bureau announced that most year groups in primary and secondary schools would move to online learning from Monday.Students and children who do not have alternative childcare arrangements can apply to attend school.The statement said the measures were being put in place in order to protect the health of teachers and students in line with current coronavirus prevention measures.The decision means that schools in the country´s financial hub will be closed for in-person learning until the end of term on 17 January, when the Lunar New Year holiday starts.Some Chinese social media users praised the decision, agreeing that it was best that students stay at home. Others complained about the efficacy of online learning in relation to in-person teaching and the extra strains put on working parents.Following its abandonment of its zero-Covid strategy, there has been an explosion of self-reported cases across the country, with many cities eerily quiet as large numbers of people isolate at home, either sick with Covid or trying to avoid becoming infected, reports the BBC´s Celia Hatton.There are concerns that China´s health infrastructure is not prepared to cope with a rapid increase in patients - especially as Covid spreads among the elderly, many of whom are not fully vaccinated.Related TopicsChinaShanghaiCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64010209,17,12,2022,bbc,china
China suspends social media accounts of Covid policy critics - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The bans come as 2 billion in China are expected to travel for the Lunar New Year over the next 40 daysBy George WrightBBC NewsChina has taken down more than 1,000 social media accounts - some with millions of followers - that criticised the government´s Covid policies.Social media platform Weibo said it had suspended or banned accounts for what it described as personal attacks against Chinese Covid specialists.Weibo did not specify which posts had prompted the action.China scrapped its strict zero-Covid policy in December and has seen a rapid surge of infections and deaths.Online criticism has until recently largely focused on the strict enforcement of Covid regulations, including lockdowns that required people to stay at home in isolation for weeks. But recent posts have taken aim at experts who have defended the sudden decision to drop restrictions, despite supporting them just weeks ago. Weibo said it had spotted almost 13,000 violations, including attacks on experts, scholars and medical workers. Temporary or permanent bans have been handed to 1,120 accounts.""It is not acceptable to hurl insults at people who hold a different point of view, or publish personal attacks and views that incite conflicts,"" Weibo said in a statement. Any kind of move that is destructive to the [Weibo] community would be handled in a serious manner.""How is China trying to beat its latest Covid surge?Young Chinese self-infect amid Covid fears for elderlyChina criticises ´political´ Covid tourist rulesSince China abandoned key parts of zero-Covid following historic protests against the policy, there have been reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed.But China has stopped publishing daily cases data and has announced only 22 Covid deaths since December, using its own strict criteria.On Saturday, China marked the first day of the 40-day period of Lunar New Year, known as the world´s largest annual migration of people. The Ministry of Transport said it expects more than two billion passengers to travel over the next 40 days, an increase of 99.5% year-on-year and reaching 70% of trip numbers in 2019.This has led to widespread concerns that the festival may see another wave of infections, especially in rural areas that are less well-equipped with ICU beds and ventilators.From Sunday, China will drop a requirement for travellers coming from abroad to quarantine, meaning many Chinese will be able to travel abroad for the first time in almost three years.Related TopicsAsiaChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64198313,07,01,2023,bbc,china
China's new human gene-editing rules worry experts - BBC News,"Image source, TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARYImage caption, Gene editing has the potential to treat numerous inherited disordersBy Pallab GhoshScience correspondentNew rules in China to regulate gene editing in humans don´t go far enough, a leading expert has warned scientists.Dr Joy Zhang of Kent University, a global expert on the governance of gene editing in China, said authorities are susceptible to ""regulatory negligence"". The regulations were updated following an outcry five years ago when a Chinese scientist said he had created the world´s first gene-edited babies.China says the new laws are in line with international rules.They set requirements for ethical approval, supervision and inspection, but experts worry that they may not apply to the private sector.China jails ´gene-edited babies´ scientistGene editing technique could transform futureDr Zhang,  one of the main speakers at an international human genome-editing summit in London, told BBC News: ""My biggest concern is that the new measures fail to cover a chronic and increasing problem in trying to deal with private ventures that are taking place outside of conventional scientific institutes.""The new rules may struggle to keep up with the burgeoning innovation that is happening in China.´´Gene editing is a new technique that enables scientists to make precise changes to DNA. Scientists believe it could be used to correct many inherited diseases. It is controversial, though, because it raises the possibility of making permanent changes to a person´s genetic make-up that will be passed down to their offspring. A controversial experimentThe world´s leading scientists in the field were stunned when Dr He Jiankui, from Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, claimed five years ago that he had created the world´s first gene-edited babies - twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana.The girls´ DNA had been altered while they were at an early embryonic stage in a way that Dr He claimed would make them resistant to HIV infection. He was fined and sentenced to three years in prison in 2019. No-one, other than Dr He, has had access to the twins. But at a recent scientific meeting, he said they were in good health.Upon his release, it emerged last month that he was planning to set up a clinic in Hong Kong to research using gene editing to develop a treatment for children with a rare inherited muscular disorder, called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Immigration officials announced that they had rescinded his visa after they discovered he had a criminal record.The new rules close the loopholes that enabled Dr He to evade regulations, which previously only applied to experiments on human beings in hospitals, for example for drug trials. The updated regulations cover all research institutions and everything relating to humans, including work on tissues, organs and embryonic cells. Image source, He JiankuiLabImage caption, Dr He Jiankui served a three-year prison sentence following claims that he created the world´s first gene-edited children five years ago.The summit organiser, Prof Robin Llovell-Badge, from the Crick Institute, where the meeting is being held, said he was concerned that there was still too much secrecy in Chinese research.´´I understand why China wants to be leaders in technology, but there are some areas that require special attention and gene editing is one of them,"" he said. ´´It has to be done properly and with the appropriate governance and oversight, and I´m concerned that they are not there yet.´´Speaking at the summit, Dr Yangin Peng, of the Chinese Academy of Science, said the government has ""accelerated"" laws and regulations in gene editing.""China has considerably tightened its legislation and regulations,"" he said. ""Permanent, inherited changes are banned, governance has adopted a precautionary approach and our laws are in line with international rules.""Image source, SPLDr Francoise Baylis, a Canadian bioethicist from Dalhousie University, said she wanted more details of the updates to China´s rules.´´I saw [that in the updated rules] research should be in line with ethical principles. I would want to know which ethical principles, where they are set out and whether they are open to questioning,´´ she said.She added that China was not alone in grappling with how to regulate the private sector.´´We have similar issues in North America, so I think it is wrong to focus on China,´´ she said.Dr Piers Millett, of the International Biosafety and Biosecurity Initiative, based in Washington, acknowledged that: ´´China is probably leading the way in revising the rules in this area.´´Image source, SEBASTIAN KAULITZKI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARYImage caption, Gene editing enables precise genetic changes to be made at the embryonic stageMany scientists have wondered how Dr He could be allowed to return to clinical research after serving time in prison. ""I, like many people, had been wondering whether there had been an individual or institution in China that had been backing or protecting He Jiankui,"" said Dr Zhang.But she said she now thought that ""we are looking at a simple case of regulatory negligence"".That led her to believe that ""without getting clarifications on Dr He´s case, the recent talk of good governance is hypocritical"".""I worry less about what He Jiankui is up to, and more about the Chinese authorities are doing,"" she said.Follow Pallab on TwitterRelated TopicsGene editingMedicineChinaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Should China worry about its shrinking population? - BBC News,"Image source, EPAImage caption, China´s statistics bureau said this week that its population has fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the birth rate also hitting a record lowBy Kelly NgBBC NewsChina´s population has fallen for the first time in six decades, official statistics revealed earlier this week - but this trend may not spell doom for the country in the short term, experts say.Beyond 2030, however, demographic stress will be a drag on growth in what is currently the world´s second-largest economy.The number of Chinese people fell by 850,000 from the previous year to 1.4118 billion, the statistics showed. Its birth rate had been slowing for years, prompting a range of policies to try to slow this trend, including scrapping the country´s infamous one-child policy seven years ago.But there are no easy fixes to this conundrum, economists and demographers say, given the unique trajectory in which the Chinese population has aged in recent years.While ageing populations have posed a challenge to economies around the world, the greater concern for China is the rapid pace at which this has been unfolding in the midst of its middle-income transition.In short, China is getting old before it gets rich.Its statistics bureau said this week that its population had fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the birth rate also hitting a record low - to no surprise. Some researchers believe the population decline started in 2018 and census estimates have been inaccurate.China´s population falls for first time since 1961In any case, China´s working-age population has been on a slump since 2012. Its age-dependency ratio, which is the ratio of children and retired people to the working age population, has risen from 37.12% in 2010 to 44.14% in 2020.Based on UN estimates, the number of Chinese aged between 15 and 64 will fall by more than 60% this century.But Andrew Harris, deputy chief economist at Fathom Financial Consulting, said the country had a pool of cheap rural labour that could help fill manufacturing gaps in urban areas.There is still ""significant slack"" in the manufacturing and construction sectors, Mr Harris added, noting that Fathom estimates that roughly one third of workers in the construction sector are underemployed, which means they are producing less than they potentially could.""The broader demographic story won´t bite fully on China´s growth until both of these sources of slack have been exhausted,"" he said. According to Paul Cheung, Singapore´s former chief statistician, China has ""plenty of manpower"" and ""a lot of lead time"" to manage the demographic challenge.""They are not in a doomsday scenario right away,"" Prof Cheung said.He also pointed to how countries like Japan and Singapore had managed to provide a safety net for their ageing citizenry while maintaining relative economic stability. But not everyone is as sanguine. ""The major difference between China and countries like South Korea and Japan is that its demographic (stress is) biting at much lower levels of income,"" Mr Harris said.A 2019 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that the country´s main pension fund would be depleted by 2035, in part because of its shrinking workforce.Studies by US think-tank Pew Research showed that some seven in 10 people in China already felt its public health system was under strain in 2016. A greying population and the spiralling Covid crisis have placed additional stresses on it.China´s population decline could send ripple effects across the global economy. For one, a shrinking workforce means rising labour costs, which could increase consumption and production costs. Recent reports have already shown China - long dubbed the ""factory of the world"" - losing manufacturing operations to other developing countries in Asia and South America. ""China´s shrinking labour force and manufacturing recession will lead to high prices and high inflation in the US and EU,"" said Yi Fuxian, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and longtime critic of China´s now-defunct one-child policy.Given how its recent attempts to raise fertility rates have met with limited success, China may have to look at other ways to sustain growth. BBC Future: Are there too many people?What it will mean when Indians outnumber ChineseThis will involve making hard political decisions, said George Magnus, an independent economist and associate at the China Centre at Oxford University.For instance, it should consider national legislation to raise retirement ages, Mr Magnus said. The current retirement age for most men in China is 60, while the OECD average is 64.2. The number stands at 55 for female civil servants and 50 for female blue-collar workers.However, previous calls to raise the retirement age have sparked backlash in China, with older workers not wanting to delay access to their pensions. China is already pursuing automation through robotics and artificial intelligence, but the impact on productivity is still unclear, Mr Harris said.Another solution would be to bolster the population through immigration, although this is not an option that the Chinese Communist Party has favoured historically, he noted.Although China can no longer rely on its demographic dividend to fuel its economy, that may not be a bad thing if it manages to seek growth from other sources such as productivity, some observers say.""We should be much more nuanced about the stall in China´s population growth. Planetary sustainability and urban congestion are better served by a more stable world population, which may entail declines in some countries,"" Mr Magnus said.""Demography is not destiny. The key is to get these and other nations to focus like a laser beam on ´coping mechanisms´.""You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: The past, present and future of global population explained - by the BBC´s Stephanie HegartyRelated TopicsPopulation growthAsiaChinaEconomic growth",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64329890,20,01,2023,bbc,china
FBI chief Christopher Wray says China lab leak most likely - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesBy Max Matza & Nicholas Yongin Washington and SingaporeFBI Director Christopher Wray has said that the bureau believes Covid-19 most likely originated in a Chinese government-controlled lab.""The FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident,"" he told Fox News.It is the first public confirmation of the FBI´s classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.Many scientists point out there is no evidence that it leaked from a lab.And other US government agencies have drawn differing conclusions to the FBI´s.Some of them have said - but with a low level of certainty - that the virus did not start in a lab but instead jumped from animals to humans.The White House has said there is no consensus across the US government on the origins.A joint China-World Health Organization (WHO) investigation in 2021 called the lab leak theory ""extremely unlikely"".However, the WHO investigation was deeply criticised and its director-general has since called for a new inquiry, saying: ""All hypotheses remain open and require further study.""Mr Wray´s comments come a day after the US ambassador to China called for the country to ""be more honest"" about Covid´s origins.In his interview on Tuesday, Mr Wray said China ""has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate"" efforts to identify the source of the global pandemic. He said details of the agency´s investigation were classified but the FBI had a team of experts focusing on the dangers of biological threats.In response, Beijing accused Washington of ""political manipulation"".""The conclusions they have reached have no credibility to speak of,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city´s seafood and wildlife market.The market is near a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.A few days ago, the US Department of Energy said it had found the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan but could only reach that conclusion with ""low confidence"".In response to that, many scientists who have studied the virus said this week that there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at University of Glasgow.""There´s been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,"" he said.On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden supports ""a whole-of-government effort"" to discover how Covid began.""We´re just not there [at consensus] yet,"" he said.

Brewdog: UK craft beer giant expands into China - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brewdog is one of the UK´s biggest craft beer brandsBy Peter HoskinsBusiness reporterUK-based craft beer maker Brewdog is expanding in China after partnering with brewing giant Budweiser.The joint venture with Budweiser China will see the Scottish firm´s Punk IPA and other beers brewed in China.Brewdog also says it plans to open more bars in the world´s second largest economy.It comes after the company has faced controversies in recent years and has flagged it may pursue a stock market listing.In a statement, Brewdog founder James Watt described the Budweiser partnership as ""transformational"" and said it would bring the craft brewery to ""every corner of the world´s biggest beer market"".Under the deal, Brewdog said it expects its beers would begin to be produced at Budweiser China´s Putian craft brewery, in the south-eastern province of Fujian, by the end of next month.The company said it also plans to open several bars in the country in the next three years.China, which is the world´s biggest market for beer, currently accounts for less than 1% of Brewdog´s overall sales.It is the company´s second tie-up in Asia following a deal with Asahi in Japan in 2021, which Brewdog said helped it double its sales in the country.The company says it currently has an international network of more than 110 bars but just one in China. Brewdog Shanghai, which opened in 2020, is in the Jing´An district of the city.The Scotland-headquartered firm employs more than 2,300 people and also has breweries in the US state of Ohio, Berlin in Germany and Brisbane in Australia.The company reportedly planned to start selling shares on the London stock market in 2020 but postponed the move as the pandemic saw pubs and bars closed during lockdowns.Mr Watt has said Brewdog has no plans to imminently revive a share sale but has hinted that one could take place by the end of this year.According to Brewdog´s 2021 financial results, it saw an annual operating loss of £5.5m ($6.6m).The company has faced criticism for its marketing campaigns, as well as its workplace culture.In January this year, Mr Watt said he had paid out almost £500,000 to winners of the company´s misleading ""solid gold"" beer can promotion.Some winners questioned the worth of the cans and complained after discovering they were gold-plated.Separately, a letter from ex-workers in June 2021 stated former staff had ""suffered mental illness"" as a result of working for the brewer.It made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.Mr Watt apologised to former staff and said their complaints would help make him a better chief executive.Related TopicsBrewDogBeer",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64700857,20,02,2023,bbc,china

China blocks visas for S Korea and Japan over Covid restrictions - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, ReutersImage caption, Incheon is the only airport in South Korea where flights from China can landBy Nick Marsh in SeoulBBC NewsChina has stopped issuing short-term visas to individuals from South Korea and Japan in retaliation for Covid restrictions on Chinese travellers.Beijing says the pause on South Korean visas will remain in place until ""discriminatory"" entry restrictions against China are lifted.Japan and South Korea are not the only countries imposing entry requirements on travellers from China, where Covid cases are surging, but their measures are among the most stringent.Last week, South Korea stopped issuing tourist visas for those coming from China, which the Chinese foreign ministry called ""unacceptable"" and ""unscientific"".Japan, meanwhile, is currently allowing Chinese visitors into the country - provided they test negative for Covid. This is similar to the UK and the US, but Japan is also restricting flights from China to certain Japanese cities.Beijing´s embassies in both Seoul and Tokyo confirmed the new visa restrictions for visitors to China.China reopened its borders on Sunday for the first time since March 2020 as part of scrapping of its ""zero-Covid"" policy. Reacting to China´s latest visa restrictions, South Korea´s foreign ministry told the BBC that its policy towards arrivals from China was ""in accordance with scientific and objective evidence"". According to South Korea´s Disease Control and Prevention Agency, around a third of all arrivals from China tested positive for Covid prior to the visa restrictions being put in place. Nearly everyone in China province got Covid - officialCelebrity deaths spark fears over China Covid tollAt Seoul´s Incheon International airport - the only South Korean airport still allowing flights from China - arrivals are met by military personnel in personal protective equipment. The BBC managed to speak to some of them as they were escorted to the airport testing centre. ""Personally, I think it´s OK. I have been through much worse during this pandemic,"" said William, a businessman from Shanghai. ""As a traveller I just try to comply with the policies are much as possible.""But another passenger disagreed. ""In my mind it´s not scientific at all,"" said Emily, who arrived from Hong Kong. She, like those coming from mainland China, was required to test. ""I feel like it´s a little bit unfair on this side. They must feel really unsafe, I suppose.""Many South Koreans support the idea of protecting their country from China´s coronavirus surge - but not all are convinced that the decision is a purely medical one.""There is a political element to it and the relationship between the two countries isn´t a good one. A lot of Korean people hold a lot of animosity blaming China for the coronavirus,"" said Jinsun, who was heading to Abu Dhabi.EU ´strongly´ urges Covid testing for China travelAnother woman going on her honeymoon to Paris said South Korea might not have implemented such rules if the country concerned wasn´t China. ""But then again, whatever we did, China would have a problem with it,"" she said.The South Korean curbs are supposed to last at least until the end of the month, which would give scientists time to analyse for any potential new variants coming from China. ""There´s no transparency at the moment in China about any monitoring for new variants. If a new variant comes from China, it would be a very difficult situation for the whole world,"" Professor Kim Woo Joo, an infectious diseases expert at Korea University and a government adviser, told the BBC.""It would also be a disaster for the Korean healthcare system. We currently have a lot of hospitalisations and deaths already and our elderly people are also under-vaccinated. This is what we are worried about.""At the moment, only a small number of business or diplomatic travellers from China are being allowed into South Korea. They must test negative before departure and also on arrival. One Chinese man who tested positive escaped from a bus taking him to a quarantine hotel near the airport. Two days later he was caught by police in a hotel in Seoul.Related TopicsChinaSouth KoreaCoronavirus pandemicTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

What China’s baby woes mean for its economic ambitions - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s birth rate has been on the decline for yearsBy Samantha ChanBBC News, SingaporeCrystal, who wished to withhold her real name, is a 26-year-old living in Beijing. Unlike most women from previous generations in China, she is unmarried and currently faces no pressure to tie the knot.When asked why that is, she laughs: ""I think it´s because my family members are either never married or divorced.""It appears to be a common sentiment among young urban women in China. A 2021 survey by China´s Communist Youth League of almost 3,000 people between the ages of 18 and 26, found that more than 40% of young women living in cities did not plan to marry - compared to less than 25% of men. This is in part due to rising childcare costs and the ghosts of China´s one-child policy. ""Having just one child or no children has become the social norm in China,"" says Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a prominent critic of the one-child policy. ""The economy, social environment, education and almost everything else relates back to the one-child policy,"" he adds. For Beijing, this is a worrying trend because China´s population is declining. It´s birth rate has been slowing for years but in 2022 its population fell for the first time in 60 years. That´s bad news for the world´s second-largest economy, where the workforce is already shrinking and an ageing population is beginning to put pressure on the state´s welfare services.China´s working age population - those between the ages of 16 and 59 - currently stands at about 875 million. They account for a little more than 60% of the country´s people. But the figure is expected to fall further, by another 35 million, over the next five years, according to an official estimate by the government in 2021.""China´s demographic structure in 2018 was similar to that of Japan´s in 1992,"" Mr Yi said. ""And China´s [demographic structure] in 2040 will be similar to Japan´s in 2020.""Until last year, many economists had assumed China´s growth would surpass that of the US by the end of the decade - a move which would cap the country´s extraordinary economic ascent. But Mr Yi says that is now looking unlikely, adding ""By 2031-2035, China will be doing worse than the US on all demographic metrics, and in terms of economic growth"". The average age in China is now 38. But as its population ages and birth rates plummet further, there are concerns that China´s workforce will eventually be unable to support those who have already retired. The retirement age for men in China is 60 and for women, it is 55. Currently, those above 60 make up almost a fifth of the population. In Japan, which has one of the fastest ageing populations in the world, nearly a third of the people are 65 or older. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s ageing population is bad news for its economy""Population ageing is not unique to China but the strain on China´s pension system is a lot more acute,"" says Louise Loo, a senior economist with Oxford Economics. She says the number of retirees has already exceeded the number of contributors, leading to a drop in contributions to the pension fund since 2014.The country´s pension fund is administered at a provincial level and on a pay-as-you-work basis - that is, contributions from the workforce pay the retirees´ pensions.So Beijing, aware of these cracks in its system, created a fund in 2018 to shift pension pay-outs from richer provinces like Guangdong to those facing a deficit. But in 2019 a report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that because of its shrinking workforce, the country´s main pension fund would be depleted by 2035.Then in 2022 China launched its first private pension scheme in 36 cities, allowing individuals to open retirement accounts at banks to buy pension products like mutual funds. But Ms Loo says it´s unclear if many Chinese people, who typically invest savings in more traditional avenues such as property, would turn instead to private pension funds. These problems are not unique to China - Japan and South Korea both have a greying population and a shrinking workforce. Mr Yi noted that Beijing is poised to replicate Tokyo´s policies to lower parenting costs but, he adds, ""China, which is ´getting old before it gets rich´ does not even have the financial resources to fully follow Japan´s path.""And this is not the only thing troubling Beijing. There´s also a growing online youth movement to ""lie flat"". It calls on workers to reject the struggle for career success and promises release from the pressures of life and work in a fast-paced capitalist society. Add to the mix a high youth unemployment rate, which peaked last July when 20% of those aged between 15 and 24 were jobless. As Mr Yi puts it: ""The labour force is the flour and the pension system is the skill of making bread. Without enough flour, it is impossible to make enough bread, even with the best bread-making skills.""Related TopicsAsiaChinaAgeing populationChina economyTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Covid in China: Checks on visitors under review - UK defence minister - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, ShutterstockImage caption, China is starting to open up travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020By Nathan WilliamsBBC NewsThe UK government is reviewing whether to introduce Covid restrictions on visitors from China, the defence secretary has said.Ben Wallace said the Department for Transport would take medical advice and talk to the Department of Health.Earlier, an ex-health minister urged the government to consider testing arrivals from China for Covid.A number of countries are introducing mandatory testing in response to China´s coronavirus surge. Asked whether the government would consider restrictions, Mr Wallace said: ""The government is looking at that, it´s under review, we noticed obviously what the US has done and India and I think Italy has looked at it.""""We keep under review all the time, obviously, health threats to the UK, wherever they may be.""UK Covid modelling data to stop being publishedCovid-19 in the UKSeveral countries - including the US, Japan, Italy and Malaysia - are now enforcing testing on visitors from China. This follows a surge in cases in China after Beijing´s decision to effectively end its zero-Covid policy.UK Health Minister Will Quince said he knew that many people would be concerned ""about the news coming out of China"" and the government was taking the situation ""incredibly seriously"".However, there was ""no evidence at this point of a new variant from China"", which he said would be the ""key threat"".""At the moment the variant that is in China currently is already prevalent here in the UK.""Meanwhile, the Scottish government said it currently has no plans to change travel requirements, and would continue to work with the UK Health Security Agency and other countries to ""monitor the spread of harmful variants"".In 2019, 813,532 visas were issued to people wanting to travel to the UK from China. This dropped to less than 200,000 over the following two years, owing to Beijing´s strict Covid border controls. There are concerns that a new variant may emerge in China and that international travel could quickly spread it. When there is lots of virus circulating in any population, there will be opportunities for it to change or mutate in potentially harmful ways.Covid is circulating in lots of countries around the world. According to latest estimates for the UK, one in every 45 people in Britain is infected. Vaccines are saving lives but they can´t stop infections. Instead, experts are tracking the virus and seeing if the vaccines need updating to be a better match for any significant new mutations. So far, science is keeping up with the virus and there are no particularly worrying new variants. Lord Bethell, who was health minister during the pandemic, told the BBC there was a good reason to look at testing people when they land, a policy Italy has adopted.    ""What the Italians are doing is post-flight surveillance of arrivals in Italy, in order to understand whether there are any emerging variants and to understand the impact of the virus on the Italian health system,"" he told BBC Radio 4´s Today programme.""That is a sensible thing to do and something the British government should be seriously looking at.""Chinese rush to book travel as Covid rules lifted China´s hospitals seem to be filling up - WHOChina is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he did not think the current situation in China was likely to generate many more Covid cases in the UK or generally across the globe.While China was in a ""dark"" and ""difficult"" place, the current evidence suggested the particular variant causing most infections in the country was ""very common elsewhere in the world"", he told BBC Radio 4´s PM programme on Wednesday. The UK has seen many such cases since it appeared in the summer, he added.On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.Others have also announced restrictions:In Japan, from Friday, travellers from China will be tested for Covid on arrival. Those who test positive will have to quarantine for up to seven daysIn India, people travelling from China and four other Asian countries must produce a negative Covid test before arriving. Positive passengers will also be put in quarantineTaiwan says people arriving on flights from China, as well as by boat at two islands, will have to take Covid tests on arrival throughout January. Those who test positive can isolate at homeMalaysia will begin testing wastewater from planes arriving from China and will screen the body temperatures of all international arrivals, including from China, and test anyone with symptomsItaly has also imposed mandatory Covid testing on travellers from ChinaOn Thursday, Italy urged the rest of the EU to follow its lead and ensure Chinese arrivals were tested. However, the EU´s disease agency said the surge in cases in China was not expected to impact members states and said screening travellers from China for Covid would be ""unjustified"".Beijing´s foreign ministry has said coronavirus rules should only be put in place on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of ""hyping up"" the situation.China only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020.

Newspaper headlines: 'China security risk' and 'Couzens police failings' - BBC News,"By BBC NewsStaffImage source, ReutersMysterious objects in the sky occupy many front pages. The Daily Mail says Rishi Sunak is under growing pressure to take a harder line on China, with Conservative MPs saying he should formally designate Beijing a ""threat"".The ´i´ says the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, says the row is leading to calls to increase defence spending.  Former military leaders are quoted saying a failure to do so would also embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin.The Times reports that the RAF will examine intelligence gathered by the US military - to see if it can improve its quick reaction force.According to the Daily Telegraph, the use of Chinese-made drones by British police forces has provoked security fears within the government.  The paper says more than two-thirds of the drones are made by a Chinese firm that is blacklisted in the US.  The Telegraph´s leader column questions whether adequate safeguards are in place.The Daily Star picks up on the admission by a US Air Force general that he was not ruling out aliens.  Its front page depicts ET.  Its editorial describes the comment as a ""major step forward in our dealings with the extra-terrestrial"".There is dismay in the Express that millions of households face the maximum possible council tax increase.  The paper says it is a further blow to those already hit hard by higher bills. Its editorial acknowledges that councils´ budgetary pressures are down to funding shortfalls - but argues that spendthrift authorities are culpable too. The online-only Independent has an article by a former CBI President who declares Labour to be the party of business.  It says Paul Drechsler, who was also an adviser to David Cameron, ""showers praise"" on the party - something it describes as a ""hammer blow"" for the Tories. The Guardian leads on the former Metropolitan police officer, Wayne Couzens, pleading guilty to charges of indecent exposure.  The offences happened days before he kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everard.  The paper says detectives missed ""clear chances"" to identify him as a potential sex offender.Image source, Getty ImagesOn its front page, the Times reports that water companies privately lobbied to weaken the government´s tougher sewage rules. It suggests that they argued the £56bn plan - to reduce sewage spills from storm overflows - risked adding hundreds of pounds to household bills. It quotes various objections the companies raised, such as opinion polls indicating that inflation was a greater concern for the public than the environment. The paper´s editorial argues that if Britain is to enjoy the levels of water quality that many other European countries take for granted, then customer bills must be permitted to rise. And finally, the Telegraph suggests that a new Brexit deal could be announced within a fortnight.  It has been told by sources in both Brussels and London that a pact has been thrashed out. The paper suggests progress has been made because ""the UK watered down its hard-line resistance to European judges ruling on issues in Northern Ireland"".  Downing Street, it says, has stressed that elements of an agreement are ""still moving"" - but did not deny that an announcement was expected soon.THE GOLD: Nail-biting drama based on the audacious Brink´s-Mat heistLIFE-CHANGING DECLUTTERING: Stacey Solomon helps families transform their homesRelated Internet LinksDaily ExpressDaily MailDaily MirrorDaily StarDaily TelegraphFinancial TimesGuardianIndependentMetroMorning StarSunTimesThe iBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

Relics of zero-Covid dot China as life moves on - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China built hundreds of makeshift hospitals to accommodate Covid patientsBy Fan WangBBC News China has ditched zero-Covid but remnants of the policy are still everywhere - from sprawling temporary hospitals and empty testing booths, to posters of QR codes that ask for your travel history. Streets and malls are busy again after officials announced the end of the current wave, sparked by the sudden reversal of three-year-long restrictions.There is no public record of how much China invested in what became a signature policy of leader Xi Jinping. But according to a Reuters estimate last year, Beijing was on track to spend more than 350 billion yuan ($52bn; £43bn) on Covid testing, new medical facilities, monitoring equipment and other anti-Covid measures in 2022. And now much of that infrastructure is being dismantled or repurposed - or at least that´s what officials are trying to do. In Shandong province, they recently turned a makeshift hospital - which appears to be built from metal containers - into a rental space. It offers discounted apartments to ""skilled talents"", although it´s unclear who qualifies for this. This is despite local media reporting in only December - just before zero-Covid was dropped - that Shandong´s local government was planning to spend 23bn yuan on building makeshift hospitals. This particular 605-room facility, located in the provincial capital Jinan, was being used as a quarantine centre. One tenant, who works at a carmaker nearby, told Jinan Daily that he ""literally moved in with his suitcase"", adding it was ""very convenient"" as his workplace was just across the street.The government has portrayed this as a cost-saving win. Many people commenting online support it too, suggesting it as a housing option for migrant workers.Others, however, question how comfortable this ""square cabin"" would be in winter, especially as it was built within a month last year.""I suggest the person who came up with the idea go and live in the square cabin,"" one user on Weibo mocked. On Douyin - the Chinese version of TikTok - a top-liked comment read: ""This will surely scare the talents away.""But that´s not all that remains as an inescapable reminder of life under zero-Covid. Testing booths, both mobile and stationary, had been a common sight across the country. Located in every neighbourhood, they played an essential role in implementing zero-Covid. Now some of these booths are up for sale - from 500-8,000 yuan - on second-hand trading platforms. Many more are still on the streets, sitting empty and no longer in use. Image caption, An abandoned testing booth in BeijingQueues at these sites were common at the peak of restrictions as some places required people to test every day.

Tape and barricades also frequently seen - to section off parts of streets for testing booths, queues or other Covid-related measures. Many of these remain visible too.Image caption, Tape like this was used to cordon off areasImage caption, Temporary barricades lie on the side of the roadWhile most testing requirements are gone, bright red posters asking people to scan QR codes can still be spotted everywhere.Under zero-Covid, anyone entering shops or restaurants was required to scan these codes, which revealed their travel history, whether or not they had Covid, or whether they had been in contact with someone who had tested positive.

Before the pandemic, it was the largest annual worldwide migration of people returning home to spend time with family. Two billion trips are expected to be made this Lunar New Year, double the number that travelled last year. Li Hua, who travelled from the UK to China - where her family lives - for the festival said it had been ""too long"" since she had returned, ""I´m so happy to be back, and breathe Chinese air. So happy, so happy"".Mark Clayton returned home to Zhuhai, in Guandong, with his wife and baby after visiting Hong Kong. He told the BBC his trip home had been ""nearly as smooth as it used to be pre-Covid"". ""We didn´t even show them the PCR, we simply scanned a code and put in a very quick customs declaration... And then straight through,"" he said. Young people in China self-infect as fears for elderly growChina under-representing Covid deaths, WHO warnsHow many Covid cases are there in China?But there is concern from some that opening the borders will result in more transmission of Covid-19. Some local bus drivers told the BBC they are worried they might get the virus from incoming travellers, and want their companies to provide them with more protection.Over the past three years, China had one of the world´s strictest Covid health policies that saw numerous lockdowns, frequent testing requirements and had a significant impact on the nation´s economy.The government recently walked back that policy after protests across the country, triggered by a fire in a high-rise block in the Xinjiang region that killed 10 people. Many Chinese believed the long-running Covid restrictions contributed to the deaths, but authorities denied this.Since China abandoned the key elements of its Covid zero policy there have been reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed, but the country has stopped publishing its case numbers and reported only two deaths on Saturday.On the same day, the Chinese government banned over 1,000 social media accounts critical of its handling of the virus. The anticipated surge in cases and travel out of China has prompted many countries - including the UK - to impose requirements for a negative Covid-19 test on people arriving from China, drawing the ire of the Chinese government.Listen to more on what we know about China´s Covid numbers: More or Less- Behind the Stats - Can China´s data on Covid deaths be trusted-  on BBC SoundsRelated TopicsChinaHong KongCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64201776,08,01,2023,bbc,china

Rishi Sunak: China represents challenge to world order - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, China ""represents a challenge to the world order"", the PM says.By Becky MortonPolitical reporterChina ""represents a challenge to the world order"" which the UK must take seriously, Rishi Sunak has said.The prime minister told the BBC he was increasing funding for the armed forces because ""the world has become more volatile"" and ""threats to our security have increased"". Defence spending will rise by nearly £5bn over the next two years.But No 10 has given no timeframe for a longer term ambition to boost spending to 2.5% of national income. Mr Sunak was speaking in California, where he held talks with his US and Australian counterparts to agree details of a UK-US pact to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. The agreement, known as the Aukus pact, was signed in 2021 as part of a joint effort to counter Chinese military power in the Indo-Pacific region.Sunak unveils £5bn extra defence funds on US tripBen Wallace: We need to invest in defence properlyMr Sunak said in a press conference to mark the pact that the Aukus partnership would deliver ""one of the most advanced"" submarines ""the world has ever known"", creating thousands of jobs in British shipyards.The new SSN-Aukus submarines will also be used by the UK, and will be in operation for the Royal Navy by the late 2030s under the plan.The boats will replace the UK´s seven Astute-class subs.The UK´s submarines will mainly be built by BAE Systems at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and Rolls-Royce, with the US sharing sensitive technology for the project.Australia´s boats will be built in South Australia, using some components manufactured in the UK, and will be in service in the early 2040s.Mr Sunak said: ""The Aukus partnership, and the submarines we are building in British shipyards, are a tangible demonstration of our commitment to global security.""This partnership was founded on the bedrock of our shared values and resolute focus on upholding stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.""´Another hollow promise´Earlier, in an interview with the BBC´s Chris Mason, Mr Sunak said: ""China is a country with fundamentally different values to ours and it represents a challenge to the world order.  ""And that´s why it´s right that we are alert to that and take steps to protect ourselves… stand up for our values and protect our interests.""He said the government took the ""challenge"" posed by China seriously, adding that the UK had taken action including blocking Chinese investment in sensitive sectors like semiconductors. Pressed on whether the ambition to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income was meaningless without a timeframe, the prime minister said the government should be judged ""on our actions"". As chancellor, Mr Sunak said he had overseen the largest uplift in defence spending since the end of the Cold War and the government had increased spending every year since then. ""We´re one of the largest spenders on defence anywhere in the world, the largest in Europe, and that will continue to remain the case,"" he added. However, Labour pointed out that defence spending had not hit 2.5% of GDP since it left government in 2010. The UK currently aims to spend 2% of GDP on defence each year, latest figures show.Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy described the ambition as ""another hollow promise"", with ""no plan and no timetable"". Some Tory MPs have also expressed concern about the level of investment in the armed forces. Tobias Ellwood, who is chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said the UK was on a ""peacetime budget"" as the world was ""sliding towards a new Cold War"". While Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has publicly welcomed the extra £5bn announced by the prime minister, he had been hoping for considerably more.There had been reports - denied by Mr Wallace - that he had threatened to resign if he did not get a commitment to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030.Mr Wallace told the Commons he was ""not interested"" in resigning, although he added that he was worried about the increased threats facing the UK and long-term investment was needed. Hulking floating airports, aircraft carriers, dominate the shoreline on the Pacific Coast of the United States, where there is a gathering of what´s known as the Aukus pact: Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, keeping a collectively nervous eye on an increasingly muscular China. Privately, the government is stark in its assessments. Western democracies are comparatively and collectively weaker economically as China grows; Beijing can use every instrument of the state as a tool of foreign policy in a way that´s impossible in an open democracy. All the data make us more concerned, not less, as one senior figure put it. The review of foreign and defence policy, which has just been published, says the UK is committed to ""swift and robust action"" to counter any threat to UK national interests from China. Mr Sunak was also asked whether Chinese-owned social media app TikTok should be banned on all government phones. It comes after the Sunday Times reported experts at GCHQ´s National Cyber Security Centre had identified risks to sensitive information from the app and could issue advice to ministers and civil servants. The prime minister refused to comment directly but said ""we take the security of devices seriously and we look also at what our allies are doing"". The US government and the European Commission have already taken steps to ban TikTok on the phones of staff members.  ´Overdue´The government has set out its plans for foreign and defence policy in an new version of the so-called Integrated Review. The update was ordered by then-Prime Minister Liz Truss in September last year to take account of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.The review identified Russia as ""the most pressing national security and foreign policy priority in the short-to-medium term"". But it also describes China under Communist Party rule as an ""epoch-defining and systemic challenge... across almost every aspect of national life and government policy"". It says the government will engage ""constructively"" with Beijing on shared priorities but where the Chinese government´s actions threaten the UK´s interests ""we will take swift and robust action to protect them"". Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is among the Tory MPs calling for the government to take a tougher line on China, said he was ""confused"" about what the government´s position was. ""Does that now mean that China is a threat or an epoch-defining challenge or a challenging government epoch or none of that?"" he asked in the Commons.Mr Lammy said the updated review was ""overdue"" but welcome. ""The initiative to improve understanding of China in government is vital, particularly given the Foreign Office has only been training 14 people a year to speak fluent Mandarin,"" he added.Related TopicsUK defence spendingChinaRishi Sunak",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64943445,13,03,2023,bbc,china
Covid in China: Officials say current wave is 'coming to an end' - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, EPAImage caption, China has been in the grip of a major Covid wave since restrictions were lifted in DecemberBy Nicholas YongBBC NewsChinese health officials say the country´s current wave of Covid-19 infections is ""coming to an end"".The number of severe Covid cases and deaths is trending downward, the country´s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a report.It also said there had been ""no obvious rebound"" during Lunar New Year holidays last week, where millions reunited for family gatherings.There have long been questions raised about China´s Covid reporting.But experts say the decline reported now corresponds with the expected timing of an end to this major wave. The virus tore through Chinese cities and towns after authorities lifted zero-Covid restrictions in December. However fever clinic visit rates have dropped over 90% through January and hospitalisation rates are down over 85%.Separately, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the pandemic remained a global emergency, saying it was too early to lift the highest level of alert which it declared three years ago. It said the weekly Covid death rate had been rising in recent weeks and that more than 170,000 Covid-19-related deaths had been reported globally within the last eight weeks, adding that a lack of surveillance now made it more difficult to track down variants. But the WHO acknowledged that the world was in a better position than during the peak of the Omicron wave a year ago. China eyes life beyond Covid despite high infectionsChinese families reunite for a bittersweet New YearCovid losses mount in rural China: ´There are just too many´Fears that the virus could surge again during the festive period have also not yet been realised.The CDC said: ""There has not been an obvious rebound in Covid cases during the Lunar New Year holidays. ""In this time, no new variant has been discovered, and the country´s current wave is coming to an end.""It also reported a sharp decline in the daily Covid death toll reported by hospitals - from a peak of 4,300 deaths on 4 January to 896 deaths on 23 January.Infectious diseases expert Hsu Li Yang told BBC News: ""This drop in deaths follows the decline in the first huge wave of cases after China relaxed its restrictions, which is understandable and has been seen in virtually every country experiencing a large Covid wave.""We will know soon if the Lunar New Year celebrations will trigger another surge in China cases, but it is unlikely to match what was experienced in December and the earlier part of January 2023.""One of China´s leading epidemiologists - and former head of the CDC - Zeng Guang had earlier this month warned that cases would surge in rural areas during the new year.BBC News has also found evidence of a considerable number of Covid-related deaths in China´s rural regions, as the virus spread from big cities to more remote areas with older populations.However, the CDC said there had been no immediate spike following the festive period.It´s estimated that 226 million passenger trips were taken during the Lunar New Year festive season from 22-27 January - a 70% increase from last year when pandemic restrictions were still in place across many parts of China.  According to CDC data, Covid deaths halved in consecutive weeks in January. A total of 12,658 deaths were recorded between 13-19 January, while 6,364 deaths were recorded the following week.In December, Beijing abruptly ended draconian Covid curbs that had seen millions of its citizens locked down over the past three years. That led to a severe spike in Covid infections and deaths, with some experts estimating a majority of the population contracted Covid in the weeks following.A Peking University study said that as of 11 January, some 900 million people in China had been infected with the coronavirus, amid multiple reports of overcrowded hospitals and crematoria.  However, Chinese authorities initially maintained that there had only been seven deaths since the end of zero-Covid on 7 December, after narrowing its definition of what counts as a Covid death.The National Health Commission later reported almost 60,000 Covid-related deaths between 8 December and 12 January, after it began including deaths from underlying conditions as well as respiratory failure caused by Covid. China´s official Covid data is believed to be vastly underreported, and authorities stopped releasing daily caseload reports last month. Beijing has said it has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law.""Additional reporting by Alexandra FoucheRelated TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64449226,30,01,2023,bbc,china
Oscars 2023: Petition calls for presenter Donnie Yen's removal over China remarks - BBC News,"Related TopicsHong Kong anti-government protestsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Donnie Yen has been vocal in his support of the Chinese Communist PartyBy Nicholas YongBBC News, SingaporeTens of thousands of people have signed a petition to remove Hong Kong actor Donnie Yen as an Oscars presenter over his support for the Chinese government.The online petition was started by ""a group of people from Hong Kong"".It says that his latest remarks over protests in Hong Kong in 2019 ""violate the spirit of freedom of speech"".The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, whose voters determine who the Oscars go to, has not yet commented on the petition. Yen is a globally recognised action star who recently drew controversy for an interview in which he called the protests a riot. The 59-year-old is best known for the Ip Man movies, a Hong Kong series based on a martial arts master which has grossed more than US$400m (£338m) at the worldwide box office. He will next appear alongside Keanu Reeves in Hollywood film John Wick 4.The petition - set up by well-known Hong Kong activist Tong Wai-hung - claims that the Academy´s invitation to Yen shows ""contempt for the people of Hong Kong"" and his presence will ""damage the image and reputation of the film industry"". It has more than 84,000 signatures.Last Thursday, Yen was named as a presenter for the 95th Academy Awards, which will take place at in Los Angeles on Sunday. It is not known which category Yen is scheduled to present in. The BBC has contacted the Academy for comment. Born in Guangzhou, China, Yen was raised in Hong Kong and moved to the US at the age of 11. He gained American citizenship, but later renounced it.In a recent interview with GQ Hype, the father of three reiterated his opposition to the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The protests were initially sparked by plans to allow extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, before growing into a wider anti-government movement. ""It wasn´t a protest, okay, it was a riot. I´m not going to be here talking about how to change how people feel about it,"" Yen said.""But my own experience, like, I was there, I have many friends who were there. I don´t want to get political. A lot of people might not be happy for what I´m saying, but I´m speaking from my own experience."" Yen also asserted that Western media outlets such as the BBC and CNN only focus on ""negative stories"" about China.Earlier this month, he participated in the Two Sessions in Beijing, the annual meetings of China´s legislature and top political advisory body, as a Hong Kong delegate. They are attended by thousands of representatives from across the country.Yen is a member of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which has no real legislative power and draws its members from various sectors of society.

Covid: China 2022 economic growth hit by coronavirus restrictions - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesBy Annabelle Liang and Peter HoskinsBusiness reportersChina´s economy grew last year at the second slowest rate in almost half a century - in a sign of how the country´s strict coronavirus regulations have affected businesses.Official figures show the gross domestic product (GDP) of the world´s second largest economy rose 3% in 2022.That is way below the government´s target of 5.5% but better than most economists had forecast.Last month Beijing abruptly lifted its strict zero-Covid policy.The policy had a major impact on the country´s economic activity last year but the sudden relaxation of the rules has led to a jump in Covid cases that threatens to also drag on growth in the early part of this year.Other than at the start of the pandemic in 2020, when full-year GDP expanded by 2.2%, last year´s economic growth was the weakest since 1976, when the founder of the People´s Republic of China Chairman Mao Zedong died.""The data came in stronger than our expectation. Nevertheless, it reveals the hard hit to the Chinese economy from a zero-Covid policy and a property rout in 2022,"" Jacqueline Rong, deputy China economist from the BNP Paribas bank, told the BBC.Experts have voiced caution over China´s economic numbers - with some warning that the trajectory of the data rather than the figures themselves are a useful guide to how the country´s economy is performing.How China sneaks out America´s technology secretsChina records 60,000 Covid-linked deaths in monthThe US is beating China in the battle for chipsOther Chinese economic data such as retail sales and factory output for December, which were released along with GDP data, also beat expectations but were still weak compared to pre-pandemic levels.""That is not bad news for the economy. It almost feels like household consumption held up well in spite of the surge of infections towards the end of last year,"" Qian Wang from the Vanguard investment firm said.""We are heading into 2023 with stronger momentum... this will pose a lot of upside to economic growth,"" she added.Economists have warned over the state of the global economy in recent months, pointing to several issues having an impact on growth.Last week, the World Bank said that the global economy is ""perilously close to falling into recession"".The organisation´s latest forecast blamed a number of factors stemming from Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and the impact of the pandemic.It said the US, the eurozone and China - the three most influential parts of the world for economic growth - were ""all undergoing a period of pronounced weakness"", a downturn that was worsening the problems faced by poorer countries.GDP is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of the government, companies and individuals in a country.It helps businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and governments to work out how much to tax and spend.On Monday, data released by China´s National Bureau of Statistics showed that prices of new homes declined for the fifth straight month in December.Prices in the final month of 2022 fell by 0.2% from a month earlier as Covid-19 outbreaks across the country hurt demand.Last week, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva urged Beijing to continue reopening its economy.""What is most important is for China to stay the course, not to back off from that reopening,"" Ms Georgieva said.""If they stay the course, by mid-year or there around, China will turn into a positive contributor to average global growth,"" she added.Yating Xu, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told the BBC that she has seen signs of a gradual recovery in Chinese consumer activity since its reopening.""The government´s increasing pro-growth stance and the economic recovery entering 2023 reduces the likelihood of a pandemic-policy reversal,"" she said.""However, the full reopening of mainland China´s borders is likely to be delayed until international restrictions against China-originated travel are dropped,"" she added.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Joy and relief for arrivals in China as quarantine ends for overseas travellersRelated TopicsCoronavirus lockdown measuresChinaGDPEconomic growthCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64286126,17,01,2023,bbc,china
Liz Truss: Ex-PM to join global campaign to put pressure on China - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy James Landale & Becky MortonBBC NewsFormer Prime Minister Liz Truss is to join an international campaign to put pressure on China over its human rights record and economic coercion against smaller countries. Ms Truss will address a conference of global politicians in Japan this month designed to coordinate the policies of democratic governments towards Beijing. Since she resigned in October, Ms Truss has kept a low profile. But recently her allies have formed a group to push her low-tax agenda.Members of the Conservative Growth Group include former ministers Simon Clarke and Ranil Jayawardena, who both served in Ms Truss´s cabinet. Ms Truss resigned after just 45 days in office, following the economic turmoil of her mini-budget. Golden era of UK-China relations over, says SunakLiz Truss: 11 gambles that went wrong In December the former prime minister met like-minded Republicans during a trip to Washington. However, her speech to the conference in Japan will be her first public outing overseas since leaving office. The conference is organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which seeks to coordinate international pressure on Beijing.  The cross-party group of politicians works on issues including upholding human rights and promoting trade fairness. In her speech, Ms Truss is expected to focus on the threat to Taiwan. She will also be joined by two other former prime ministers - Scott Morrison of Australia and Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium.Diplomats will watch closely to see if Ms Truss adopts a harder line than her former government, which still hopes to cooperate with China on climate change and trade. In November, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the so-called ""golden era"" of relations with China was over and that the closer economic ties of the previous decade had been ""naïve"". But he stressed ""we cannot simply ignore China´s significance in world affairs - to global economic stability or issues like climate change"".Ms Truss´s predecessor as prime minister, Boris Johnson, has also re-emerged on the global stage since leaving office.

Japan defence: China threat prompts plan to double military spending - BBC News,"Image source, EPAImage caption, Despite shifting public opinion there is still considerable opposition to increasing military spending in JapanJapan has announced it will double its military spending in the next five years, citing threats posed by China and North Korea. It will also acquire the ability to strike enemy bases.The changes mark the most dramatic overhaul to Japan´s security strategy since it adopted a pacifist constitution after World War Two. Under the plan, Tokyo will buy US long-range missiles capable of destroying enemy launch sites if it is attacked. It will also increase its cyber warfare capabilities. Earlier this week, Beijing urged Tokyo to view their relationship as a cooperative partnership.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told journalists Japan´s defence budget would be 2% of GDP by 2027.""Unfortunately in the vicinity of our country, there are countries carrying out activities such as enhancement of nuclear capability, a rapid military build-up and unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force,"" he said. ""These are also now becoming more outstanding. In the next five years, in order to fundamentally reinforce our defence capabilities we will implement a defence build-up programme worth 43 trillion yen ($314bn; £257bn).""A national security strategy document approved by the cabinet and quoted by AFP news agency described China as ""the greatest strategic challenge ever to securing the peace and stability of Japan"".It also noted that China had not ruled out the use of force to assert control over Taiwan.China´s embassy in Japan responded by accusing Tokyo of making false claims about its military activities.There are also concerns in Japan about North Korea´s missile capability. Pyongyang has fired more than 50 missiles over the past three months, including a ballistic missile over Japan in October - the first time for five years.Meanwhile the Japanese document described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a ""serious violation of laws that forbid the use of force"" which had ""shaken the foundations of the international order"".Will Ukraine invasion push Japan to go nuclear?A previous national security document in 2013 described China and Russia as strategic partners.Japan´s post-war constitution does not officially recognise the military and limits it to self-defence capabilities, though former prime minister Shinzo Abe expanded its role in 2015.Polls suggest public opinion in Japan now broadly supports some form of further military expansion.Mr Kishida´s 2% of GDP figure coincides with a long-term target set by Japan´s allies in the Western Nato military alliance in 2006.While many Nato countries are still short of the target, Germany hopes to reach it in the next few years. The UK has surpassed it and is aiming to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2030.Related TopicsChinaJapanMilitaryNorth Korea",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64001554,16,12,2022,bbc,china
China Covid: EU officials 'strongly' urge testing for travel - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, EPAImage caption, People arriving from China in London on Wednesday. England - outside the EU - is asking for pre-departure tests for Chinese arrivals from ThursdayBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsEuropean Union officials are ""strongly"" recommending that all member states insist on negative Covid tests from Chinese arrivals before they travel.Travel in and out of China gets easier from Sunday, as part of the scrapping of the ""zero-Covid"" policy.China is currently seeing a surge in Covid cases, with reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed.Some EU countries have already introduced testing - despite earlier advice that it was ""unjustified"". China under-representing Covid deaths, WHO warnsWednesday´s recommendation on negative tests came from the EU´s Integrated Political Crisis Response group (IPCR), a body made up of officials from the EU´s 27 governments.It also advised that:All passengers on flights to and from China wear face masksRandom testing of flights from China be introduced, andWastewater monitoring be conducted at airports.The recommendation comes a day after the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said an ""overwhelming"" number of member states favoured restrictions on Chinese arrivals.France, Spain and Italy have already introduced testing - but others, such as Germany, had been monitoring the situation. England, outside the EU, requires pre-flight testing on China arrivals from Thursday.Despite the recommendation, it´s not known if an EU-wide policy will be introduced - but individual states can set their own policy.The advice from the IPCR is a change in tack from the body´s disease prevention agency, which last week advised against the introduction of mandatory Covid tests.The ECDC said testing was ""unjustified"", given the high rates of vaccination in Europe, and that variants circulating in China were already in the European Union.The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday said there was no evidence of new variants in China, despite the surge in cases. However, experts warned this could be due to a lack of testing and data. The WHO has also said that China was under-representing the true impact of Covid in the country - in part due to what they said was a ""too narrow"" definition of a Covid death. Beijing has confirmed only 22 deaths since December, which is at odds with data from analysts. The UK science data company Airfinity estimates there are more than two million Covid cases a day in China, and 14,700 deaths.The Chinese government suggested earlier this week that travel restrictions on Chinese arrivals are politically motivated - and has warned that it may retaliate.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus testingEuropean UnionCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64167061,04,01,2023,bbc,china
China reopening borders to foreign tourists for first time since Covid erupted - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China is hoping to revive tourism and the economy by lifting border restrictions.By Joel GuintoBBC NewsChina is to resume issuing visas to foreign tourists for the first time since the Covid pandemic broke out three years ago.The major easing of restrictions comes after Beijing declared victory over the virus and retreated from a zero-Covid strategy that has hurt its economy.From 15 March, foreign offices can process applications for Chinese visas.Visa-free entry will also resume in Hainan Island and Shanghai for cruise ships.Tour groups from Hong Kong and Macau will also regain their visa-free privilege.In addition, valid visas issued before China closed to the world on 28 March 2020 will be honoured again.The removal of the last cross-border restrictions imposed to tackle Covid marks a major step towards the resumption of normal life in post-pandemic China.Tens of millions of international visitors came to China each year prior to the pandemic, and its tourism industry has been hard hit by strict anti-Covid measures.But the country can expect a significant increase in international arrivals, after it reopens its borders, analysts say.Chinese citizens will also be allowed to travel on tour groups to 60 countries, up from 20 previously.China said its gross domestic product grew just 3% in 2022, the worst in nearly half a century.For the current year, Beijing has set a 5% target with new Premier Li Qiang saying that the world´s second largest economy is stabilising and picking up again.The zero-Covid policy that was lifted in December sparked rare protests against China´s leader, Xi Jinping. He has since solidified his grip on power in the Communist Party and secured a record third term as president.Are you planning to travel to China?

Suppressing China won't make America great - Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang - BBC News,"Image source, EPAImage caption, Qin Gang has held his first press conference as China´s foreign ministerBy Kelly NgBBC NewsChina´s foreign minister says China-US relations have ""seriously deviated"" while warning of potential conflict.""Containment and suppression will not make America great. It will not stop the rejuvenation of China,"" said Qin Gang. Mr Qin, China´s former ambassador to the US, held his first press conference as foreign minister on Tuesday.The spy balloon saga has heightened tensions between the superpowers despite recent efforts to improve ties. ""It [the US] regards China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong,"" said Mr Qin, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China´s parliament in Beijing. The foreign minister was responding to a question on whether a healthy China-US relationship was still possible as differences between the countries grew.The US called for establishing ""guardrails"", but what it really wants is for China to not hit back with words or actions when provoked, Mr Qin added. He was referring to US President Joe Biden´s comments last month that the US would ""compete fully with China but [is] not looking for conflict"". Biden makes no apologies for downing balloonMr Qin said: ""If the US does not put on the brakes and continues to roar down the wrong road, no amount of guardrails can stop the derailment and overturning, and it is bound to fall into conflict and confrontation. Who will bear its disastrous consequences?"" He also said the diplomatic crisis caused by the balloon incident could have been averted but the US acted with ""the presumption of guilt"". Washington has previously described the suspected spy balloon as a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"". Beijing admitted the object belonged to them, but said it was a civilian airship blown off-course. Spy Balloons: Are They Really A Threat?The BBC´s Gordon Corera breaks down what we know about spy balloonsWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)Relations between the two countries deteriorated during former US President Donald Trump´s administration, which launched a trade war against China in 2018. The two superpowers continue to clash on various issues, including Taiwan, China´s militarisation of the South China Sea and the origins of Covid.Mr Qin´s comments follow Chinese President Xi Jinping´s unusually direct rebuke of the US on Monday.Mr Xi said ""Western countries led by the US had implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression"" against China and that this brought ""severe challenges"" to the country.On Tuesday, Mr Qin said an ""invisible hand"" was driving the Ukraine crisis but did not name any country or individual. He reiterated that China had not provided weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine war and called for peace talks to resume.However, he asked: ""Why should the US demand that China refrain from supplying arms to Russia when it sells arms to Taiwan?""The Ukraine crisis has reached a ""critical juncture"", he said.""Either a ceasefire will stop the war, restore peace and embark on a political settlement, or fuel the fire, expand the crisis and drag it into the abyss of losing control.""Mr Qin, 56, was named China´s foreign minister in December 2022 and is one of the youngest appointees to this post in the country´s history. He replaced Wang Yi, who was promoted to the politburo of the ruling Communist Party in October that year.A trusted aide of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr Qin is well known as a tough-talking diplomat.

LVMH: Luxury giant's sales soar despite China losses - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Louis Vuitton is one of LVMH successful brandsBy Monica MillerBBC News, SingaporeThe world´s biggest luxury group has reported strong sales driven by the holiday shopping season. LVMH said they experienced a second straight record year with revenue and profits despite geopolitical tensions and high cost of living.Sales reached almost $25bn (£19.9), a 9% increase in the final three months of the year. The company saw strong growth in Europe, US and Japan which made up for losses in China due to Covid lockdowns. In Asia, LVMH did experience a 20% drop in growth in the first nine months as the world´s second largest economy doubled down on its zero-Covid policy.  However, LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said he felt cautiously optimistic about ""green shoots"" in China.  ""We have every reason to be confident, indeed optimistic about China,"" Mr Arnault said at the group´s earnings presentation.  He pointed to their Macau stores as a sign of what could come. ""Business is back, the Chinese are buying,"" he said. LVMH brands include Tiffany´s, Christian Dior, Sephora, Hennessey and Moët. Its designer label Louis Vuitton did exceptionally well. Its revenue surpassed $21.7bn for the first time. The label recently launched a new collaboration with Japanese contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama, who is known for her art made of colourful dots. LVMH´s earnings are viewed by analysts as a bellwether in the luxury market.Bain and Company said they see a boost in spending on personal luxury goods overall. ""The personal luxury market is projected to see further growth of at least 3-8% next year, even given a downturn in global economic conditions,"" according to a report from the consulting company.Earlier this month, LVMH made changes to its leadership staff. Mr Arnault, one of the world´s richest men, appointed his daughter as the head of the fashion house Dior. Delphine Arnault, 47, replaced Pietro Beccari - who took over as chief executive of Louis Vuitton.All five of Mr Arnault´s children hold management positions at brands in the group.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64408724,27,01,2023,bbc,china
China Covid: WHO warns about under-representing Covid deaths - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, ReutersImage caption, Hospitals across China are under pressure amid a fresh wave of Covid infectionsBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsThe World Health Organization has warned that China is under-representing the true impact of Covid in the country - in particular deaths.The removal of most restrictions last month has led to a surge in cases. But China has stopped publishing daily cases data, and has announced only 22 Covid deaths since December, using its own strict criteria.""We believe that definition [of a Covid death] is too narrow,"" WHO emergencies director Dr Michael Ryan said.Dr Ryan said China´s figures ""under-represent the true impact of the disease in terms of hospital admissions, in terms of ICU admissions, and particularly in terms of deaths"".China last month changed its criteria for what constitutes a Covid death, meaning only those who die of respiratory illnesses are counted. This goes against WHO guidance, which encourages countries to count the number of excess deaths - how many more people die than would normally be expected based on death figures before the pandemic hit.Dr Ryan added that China had increased its engagement with the WHO in recent weeks, and said he looked forward to receiving ""more comprehensive data.""But he also suggested individual health workers could report their own data and experiences.""We do not discourage doctors and nurses reporting these deaths and these cases,"" Dr Ryan said. ""We have an open approach to be able to record the actual impact of disease in society.""The UK science data company Airfinity estimates more than two million Covid cases a day in China, and 14,700 deaths.Since China abandoned key parts of its ""zero-Covid"" strategy almost a month ago, there have been reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed.More than a dozen nations have introduced travel restrictions on travellers from China. Beijing has criticised these as politically motivated and threatened to retaliate.On Wednesday, the European Union issued new guidance ""strongly"" recommending that all member states introduce the requirement that passengers flying from China provide a negative Covid test before their departure. No new Covid variants have been detected in China, despite the surge in cases. However, the WHO has warned this could be due to a decrease in testing. What is known about new Covid variant XBB.1.5?The Chinese authorities have announced they are sending medical supplies to rural hospitals before an expected wave of coronavirus infections in the countryside - where vaccination rates are patchy. Dr Abdi Rahman Mahamud, director of the WHO´s alert and response coordination department, has warned China may see another wave of infections as families gather for China´s Lunar New Year in a few weeks - one of the country´s busiest travel periods.

"Covid in China: Officials must share data on its impact, says WHO - BBC News","Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Strict lockdowns and quarantine rules have ended, but infections are surging across ChinaBy George WrightBBC NewsChinese officials must share more real-time information on Covid in the country as infections surge, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.Many of the country´s strict restrictions have been lifted over the last few weeks, but cases have soared and several countries are now screening travellers from China.WHO officials say they want to see more data on hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths.It also wants figures on vaccinations.The United States, Spain, France, South Korea, India, Italy, Japan and Taiwan have all imposed Covid tests for travellers from China, as they fear a renewed spread of the virus.And passengers arriving in England from China will have to provide a negative test before they board a flight. A quick guide to China’s Covid rule changesHow many cases and deaths are there in China?France, Spain and others bring in China Covid testsIn a statement issued after talks with Chinese officials the UN health agency said: ""WHO again asked for regular sharing of specific and real-time data on the epidemiological situation... and data on vaccinations delivered and vaccination status, especially in vulnerable people and those over 60.""The agency said it was willing to provide support on these areas, as well as help with addressing the issue of vaccine hesitancy.It also stressed ""the importance of monitoring, and the timely publication of data, to help China and the global community to formulate accurate risk assessments and to inform effective responses"".WHO´s technical advisory group on the evolution of Covid-19 is set to hold a meeting on Tuesday.

China’s Covid surgeThe sudden lifting of many of China´s restrictions follows November´s protests against the government´s management of the disease.Until then, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as a zero-Covid policy.It included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.Lockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished. People are now free to travel abroad again.Cases have since been on the rise, with the Chinese government reporting about 5,000 a day. But analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.Officially there have only been 13 Covid deaths throughout December, but UK-based health data firm Airfinity said on Thursday that around 9,000 people in China are probably dying each day from the disease.

Why is South Africa's navy joining exercises with Russia and China? - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Russian fleet, led by the Admiral Gorshkov warshipSouth Africa is holding a joint military exercise with Russia and China that opposition figures say amounts to an endorsement of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.The US has also criticised the 10-day naval drills, which will continue over the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine.But South Africa´s government says it remains neutral regarding the conflict, and that it routinely hosts similar drills with other countries, including France and the US.What are South Africa, Russia and China doing?The naval exercises, called Mosi, which means ""smoke"" in the Tswana language, are taking place in the Indian Ocean, off the South African coast.The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says 350 members of its armed forces will take part.Russia has announced it will send its Admiral Gorshkov warship, which carries Zircon hypersonic missiles. These fly at nine times the speed of sound and have a range of 1,000 km (620 miles).  Moscow ""will be trying to show that despite its setbacks in the war in Ukraine, its armed forces are still very powerful"", says Denys Reva from South Africa´s Institute for Security Studies.The SANDF has said little about the forthcoming exercise, but a 2019 joint drill between the three countries involved seven ships - one warship from each nation, plus fuelling ships and survey ships. They practised tackling coastal fires and floods, and recapturing ships from pirates.How Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaWhy is this exercise controversial?A White House spokesperson said in January: ""The United States has concerns about any country... exercising with Russia as Russia wages a brutal war against Ukraine.""South Africa previously abstained from a UN vote condemning the invasion. It also refused to join the US and Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia. The South African government sparked a political row when it gave permission for a superyacht called the Nord, which is linked to the sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov, to dock in Cape Town - although it is thought the vessel did not actually go there.The sanctioned Russian cargo ship, Lady R, was also allowed to unload supplies at a South African naval base. The government said it contained a delayed order for ammunition.South Africa points out it has held four joint exercises with the US since 2011, as well as drills with France and Germany.""All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,"" said Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, during a visit to her country by her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in January.She said that trying to stop South Africa from conducting joint military exercises with the countries of its choice amounted to ""an abuse of international practice"".What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Why is South Africa taking part?South Africa is also taking part because its armed forces are underfunded and overstretched, according to Elizabeth Sidiropoulos, head of the South African Institute of International Affairs. The navy´s priorities are to protect fisheries in its home waters and combat piracy in the Indian Ocean.""It needs to team up with other nations to have the capacity to deal with things off its coast such as piracy,"" she says.Image source, ReutersImage caption, South African foreign minister Nalida Pandor hosted a visit from her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in JanuarySouth Africa´s governing African National Congress (ANC) also has long-standing ties with Russia. These date back to the years of white-minority rule before 1994, says Dr Alex Vines from the Chatham House think-tank in London.""The older leaders in the ANC still have an emotional attachment to Moscow, because it constantly supported their struggle,"" he says. ""That makes it very difficult for South Africa to turn its back on Russia over Ukraine.""Russia, China and South Africa also have modern-day ties because they are all members of the Brics alliance.The group - which also includes Brazil and India - represents some of the world´s leading emerging economies.What do Russia and China want?Ms Sidiropoulos says Russia has more to gain than anyone from this year´s exercise. ""It shows that Russia can still project its power far away, and that it still has allies around the world.""It lets them say that it´s not the world that´s against Russia. Only the West is against Russia."" China is keen to keep shipping lanes open for commercial vessels travelling from its ports to African destinations, says Dr Vines.It also wants to establish its naval power in the Indian Ocean, off the African coast.""It´s about getting its navy out into international waters.""China already uses Djibouti on the East African coast as a naval base to combat piracy, and perhaps it is hoping to get more bases.""Related TopicsSouth AfricaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Covid tests for China travellers to England ending - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, ANDY RAIN/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockBy Nadeem Shad & Jemma DempseyBBC NewsTravellers flying into England from mainland China will no longer have to provide proof of a negative pre-departure test from next month.The change will come into effect on 5 April - exactly three months after the measures started.Ministers brought in controls after a spike in cases following Beijing´s relaxation of its zero-Covid policy.Their removal comes after greater transparency from China, the government said.In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that there has been increased information on ""testing, vaccination and genomic sequencing results"" on China´s domestic disease levels.The data indicates that Covid variants seen in China ""continue to be the same as those already circulating in the UK"", it added.The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that all regions had passed their infection peak, the statement reported.The DHSC also announced that the UK Health Security Agency´s (UKHSA) voluntary on-arrival testing programme of travellers from China to Heathrow airport has come to an end. Heathrow sees busiest January since start of CovidRelics of zero-Covid dot China as life moves on The temporary testing programme was implemented in January. The government said its aim was to improve Covid surveillance of travellers arriving at London´s main airport from China by helping to detect potential new variants.The government said an average of 99 people per flight had been tested, totalling 3,374 passengers.During that period, 14 positive cases were identified, but none was deemed to be a variant of concern.The DHSC said from Friday, 17 March ""passengers aged 18 or over travelling from mainland China and arriving at Heathrow Airport will no longer be invited to take a voluntary test on arrival"".""The ending of this enhanced surveillance is in line with international partners such as the EU who are reducing border measures to monitor new variants from China"" .Officials said the government would maintain a range of contingency measures to ""enable detection, and swift and proportionate action, for potential new harmful variants"" should the need arise.Last December, ministers confirmed that passengers arriving to England from China would have to provide a negative Covid test before they boarded their flights. The Chinese government was reporting about 5,000 cases a day at the time, but analysts said the numbers were vastly undercounted - and that the daily caseload could have been closer to one million.Other countries around the world such as the US, France India also implemented testing.While the decision only affected English airports, the  government said that despite their being no direct flights from China to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, that it was working with the devolved administrations to ensure the policy was applied UK-wide.In January, China reopened its borders to international visitors for the first time since it imposed travel restrictions in March 2020 while officials declared later that month that the country´s current wave of Covid-19 infections was ""coming to an end"".China´s National Health Commission stopped publishing data on Covid cases and deaths on 25 December after the relaxation of its zero-Covid policy and in February declared a ""decisive victory"" over the pandemic.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus testingAir travelCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64993197,17,03,2023,bbc,china
China Covid: How is it tackling the latest surge in cases? - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesHospitals in China are reported to be filling up with Covid patients after infections surged when the country relaxed its lockdown rules.The government says it is ramping up its vaccination programme. What are China´s Covid rules now?In December, China dropped mass testing in cities and regions where there have been outbreaks. People are no longer required to go into quarantine in state facilities if they or someone they have been in contact with tests positive.Image source, ReutersImage caption, There were widespread protests against China´s rigid Covid restrictionsThere are reports of hospitals filling up with patients and a growing demand for funeral services.But officially, China is reporting relatively low numbers of Covid cases and a tiny number of deaths.Because it has ended its mass testing programme, Chinese authorities no longer have reliable figures for the number of Covid infections.The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked it to provide specific data on disease severity and hospital admissions.China´s hospitals seem to be filling up - WHO´Everyone I know is getting a fever´ - Covid hits China Covid wave batters China´s overstretched hospitalsThe WHO has also asked for more data on vaccination rates, especially amongst vulnerable groups and those over 60 years old.The EU has confirmed that it´s ready offer surplus vaccines to China, which has so far largely relied on its own home-produced vaccines.How many people have been vaccinated in China?Official figures for November 2022 suggest Chinese health authorities have now vaccinated 40% of over-80s with two jabs and a booster. People in this age range are the most vulnerable to the virus. This is a big improvement on China´s past performance.In April 2022, fewer than 20% of over-80s had had two jabs and a booster. China is now reported to have set a goal for 90% of its over-80s to receive either the initial two vaccination jabs, or both plus a booster, by the end of January.However, vaccinations alone may not be enough to halt the surge in Covid cases.Experts believe that because the Chinese population has been locked down so much, many people have not picked up ""hybrid immunity"".This means they haven´t gained protection both from being vaccinated and from being exposed to the virus through other people.  Why have so few elderly people been vaccinated?When China´s government started rolling out vaccines in late 2020, it prioritised the working-age population. It did not test its vaccines on many elderly people, and told them it could not say whether the jabs were safe for this age group.The head of China´s Covid expert panel, Prof Liang Wannian, says that made some people reluctant to get their jabs.""Many old people have underlying diseases,"" he says. ""They reckon it won´t be safe to get vaccinated.""Are China´s Covid vaccines effective?China has mainly used only its domestically-produced vaccines: CoronaVac, made by a company called Sinovac, and Sinopharm.Both use parts of a dead coronavirus to expose the body to Covid and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A vaccine production plant in ShanghaiBut studies suggest they are less effective than the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, widely used in Western countries. Research published in December last year, which looked at data from Singapore, found that mRNA vaccines worked better than Chinese vaccines in preventing severe illness in the over-60s.These train the immune system to attack the spike protein on the virus - the part of the virus which infects the body´s cells. They offer greater protection against severe disease or death. What do we know about China´s Covid-19 vaccines?Why has China not used Western Covid vaccines?China claims to have made about half of all the world´s Covid vaccine stock. But the government has not given approval to foreign-produced mRNA vaccines for general use in mainland China. BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer to produce a Covid vaccine, has also worked with a Shanghai-based company, Fosun Pharma, to develop the same mRNA-based vaccine.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China has largely relied on home-produced vaccines like SinopharmThis has been made available to German nationals living in China, and is also available in Hong Kong and Macau. However, it is not currently authorised for the Chinese mainland market.China is reported to be developing its own mRNA vaccines, and although one has been given approval for emergency use in Indonesia, it is not being used in China at the moment.When asked about the EU offer to send surplus stock of its mRNA vaccines, a Chinese official spokesperson, Mao Ning, said that China already had an adequate supply of vaccines.""China´s Covid situation is predictable and under control,"" she told a news conference on 3 January.Related TopicsCoronavirus vaccinesChinaVaccinationCoronavirus pandemicTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Jiang Yanyong: Whistleblower doctor who exposed China's Sars cover-up dies - BBC News,"Related TopicsTiananmen Square protests of 1989Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jiang Yanyong blew the whistle about Sars early on in the 2003 crisisBy Kelly NgBBC News, SingaporeJiang Yanyong, a former military surgeon who blew the whistle on Chinese authorities´ cover-up of the 2003 Sars epidemic, has died aged 91.He died of pneumonia on Saturday in Beijing, family friends and Chinese-language media in Hong Kong reported.Dr Jiang was praised for saving lives after writing a letter in the early stage of the Sars crisis which revealed officials were playing down the threat.But he endured house arrest at one point for his unwavering outspokenness. Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide in 2003. Of these, 774 died, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures. Dr Jiang had been working in a Beijing hospital in April 2003, when he was alarmed to hear the Chinese health minister telling the public there were only a handful of cases of a new deadly respiratory disease.The senior doctor said he knew more than 100 people had Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - in military hospital wards alone.He sent a letter exposing the lies in the official narrative to Chinese state broadcasters, who ignored it. But the letter was then leaked to foreign media which published his account in full.His revelations forced the Chinese government to admit it had provided false information, and spurred the WHO into action.Strict containment measures were imposed overnight, which helped slow the spread of the virus. His actions also led to the sacking of China´s health minister and Beijing´s mayor at the time.""I felt I had to reveal what was happening, not just to save China, but to save the world,"" he said about his actions.Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemic‎?Beijing ´brainwashes Sars hero´The following year, Dr Jiang again challenged Beijing. He called on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to acknowledge its 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters had been wrong - and that hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilians had been killed.He wrote of his experience working as a surgeon in Beijing on that night. In a letter, he recounted how authorities ""acted in frenzied fashion, using tanks, machine guns and other weapons to suppress the totally unarmed students and citizens"".Ordinary Chinese would be ""increasingly disappointed and angry"" with the CCP´s view of the protests as a counter-revolutionary riot, he said. ""Our party must address the mistake it has made,"" he wrote.He and his wife, Hua Zhongwei, were later detained, but Dr Jiang remained for years undeterred on the topic. He wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019, denouncing the Tiananmen Square crackdown as a ""crime"". Dr Jiang was born in 1931 in the eastern city of Hangzhou to a wealthy banking family and went into medicine after seeing his aunt die of tuberculosis. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter, according to South China Morning Post.Over his lifetime he received several civil honours recognising his public stands, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 2004.""He broke China´s habit of silence and forced the truth of Sars into the open,"" the award citation read.Dr Jiang´s experience has drawn comparisons with China´s initial approach to the Covid-19 outbreak. Li Wenliang, an eye doctor in Wuhan, was investigated by police for ""spreading rumours"" after trying to warn people of a ""Sars-like virus"" in December 2019. After falling sick from Covid himself, Dr Li said on Chinese social media that he wondered why authorities were saying no medical staff had been infected. Dr Li died of the virus in February 2020.

China Covid: Coffins sell out as rural losses mount - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage caption, Demand for coffins in some rural areas has spikedBy Stephen McDonell in ShanxiBBC NewsThe BBC has found evidence of a considerable number of Covid-related deaths in China´s rural regions, as the virus spread from big cities to more remote areas with older populations. In Xinzhou region of northern Shanxi province the coffin makers have been busy. We watched the skilled craftsmen as they carved elaborate decorations into the freshly-cut wood. Over recent months, they say, they haven´t had time to stop.One villager, a customer, told us that at times the coffins have sold out. Laughing with a dose of the black humour you find in the area, he added that those in the funeral industry had been ""earning a small fortune"".There has been much debate about the real number of Covid deaths in China, after the virus ripped through its megacities. Some 80% of the population - more than a billion people - have been infected since China scrapped restrictions in December, according to leading epidemiologist Wu Zunyou. Last weekend China reported 13,000 Covid-related deaths in less than a week, adding to the 60,000 deaths it has counted since December.But these deaths have been in hospitals. In rural areas there are only sparse medical facilities and those who die at home are mostly not being counted.There is not even an official estimate for the number of village deaths. But the BBC found evidence the death toll is mounting.We visited a crematorium and they too have been busy, mourners dressed in white walking forward carrying the ceremonial box which would eventually contain the remains of a loved one.In another village, we saw one man and woman loading huge tissue paper birds onto the back of a flatbed truck. ""They´re cranes. You ride the crane into the afterlife,"" the woman said.As they packed up other elaborate, Buddhist images newly made from tissue paper they said they´d had an explosion in demand for their funeral decorations, two or three times what´s normal.Everyone we met in this part of Shanxi who is connected to the funeral industry told us a similar story about an increase in deaths and they all attributed it to the coronavirus.Image caption, Wang Peiwei is determined to put on a good funeral for his sister-in-law""Some sick people are already very weak,"" one man said as he continued to load the truck. ""Then they catch Covid, and their elderly bodies can´t handle it.""We followed the truck to where the artworks were being delivered and met Wang Peiwei, whose sister-in-law had just died.The mother-of-two in her 50s had suffered from severe diabetes for years and then she caught the coronavirus.""After she got Covid she had a high fever, and her organs began to fail. Her immune system wasn´t strong enough to make it,"" said Mr Wang.The courtyard at the family house was filling up with decorations for the ceremony. Mr Wang told us there were still more images, flowers and the like to come.Standing in front of a tent in the courtyard where her body was covered up he explained that, on the day of the funeral, 16 people would carry her coffin and bury her in accordance with tradition.He said that, though the cost of funeral arrangements had skyrocketed because of the number of Covid deaths, they would pay the extra money in her honour.""She was a great person. We must hold a grand event to send her off, the best we can afford,"" he said. Every year, hundreds of millions of younger people go back to their hometowns at this time to celebrate the Lunar New Year. It´s China´s most important festival.The villages they are returning to are now places where mostly older people live - people who are more vulnerable to Covid.Image caption, Millions of people have travelled back to their hometowns from big citiesThere has been great concern that this year´s Spring Festival mass migration could quickly spread the coronavirus into more remote areas, to deadly effect.The government warned those in the cities not to go home this year if their elderly relatives had not yet been infected.Doctor Dong Yongming, who operates a very small village clinic, thinks at least 80% of residents there had already caught Covid.""All the villagers come to us when they´re sick,"" he said. ""We´re the only clinic here.""Most who had died there had underlying diseases, he said.In terms of managing the medicine they had as Covid hit the village, Dr Dong said they would not sell medicine to people beyond their needs.""For example, I would only give out four Ibuprofen tablets per person,"" he said. ""They don´t need two boxes. It´ll just be wasted.""However he said he believed the worst of this Covid wave was already behind them: ""We haven´t had any patients in recent days.""Those who die in this region are buried in the fields. Farmers then continue to plant crops and raise livestock around the mounds of their ancestors.Driving along the road we noticed fresh mounds of earth with red flags placed on the top. A lot of them. A farmer herding goats confirmed that they were new graves.""Families have been burying elderly people here after they die. There are just too many,"" he said.Image caption, Fresh graves dot the nearby fieldsIn his village of a few thousand, he said that more than 40 residents had died during the most recent Covid wave.""One day someone would die, then the next day someone else. It´s been non-stop over the past month,"" he said.But in the countryside here, they are quite philosophical about life and death. This farmer said people would still celebrate the new year like they always have.""My son and daughter-in-law will come back soon,"" he said. I asked if locals were worried that family members returning could mean more infections.""People shouldn´t worry. No fear!"" he said. ""You will still become infected even if you hide. Most of us have already got it and we are fine.""He, and many others are hoping that Covid´s most deadly work has already been done and that, for the time being at least, their energy can be spent on being with the living rather than burying the dead.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64347085,25,01,2023,bbc,china
US secures deal on Philippines bases to complete arc around China - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin (R) was in the Philippines to finalise the dealBy Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, ManilaThe US has secured access to four additional military bases in the Philippines - a key bit of real estate which would offer a front seat to monitor the Chinese in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. With the deal, Washington has stitched the gap in the arc of US alliances stretching from South Korea and Japan in the north to Australia in the south.The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints - Taiwan and the South China Sea.The deal, which in part reverses the US´ departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. ""There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,"" says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""The US is not looking for permanent bases. It´s about places, not bases."" The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will ""allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges"", likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. The statement came after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. The US hasn´t said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan - if you don´t count China.China criticised the agreement, saying ""US actions escalate regional tension and undermine regional peace and stability"". ""The United States, out of its self interests and zero-sum game mentality, continues to step up military posture in this region,"" its embassy said in a statement.These days the US is seeking access to places where ""light and flexible"" operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay. Then in 1991 the Philippine government called time. The Filipinos had recently overthrown the hated dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and sending the old colonial masters home would further cement both democracy and independence. The Vietnam war was long over, the Cold War was winding down, and China was as yet a military weakling. So, in 1992, the Americans went home - or at least most of them did. US reopens Pacific embassy in push to counter ChinaHow US Marines are being reshaped for China threatThe US wants to play in China´s backyardRoll forward 30-odd years and another Marcos is back in the Malacañang Palace. More important, China is no longer a military weakling, and it´s knocking on the Philippines´ front door. Manila has watched - horrified but powerless to intervene - as Beijing has set about redrawing the map of the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea as Manila insists on calling it. Since 2014 China has built 10 artificial island bases, including one at Mischief Reef, deep inside the Philippines´ own exclusive economic zone or EEZ. Up to then relations between Manila and Beijing had been free of major problems, says Herman Kraft, a political science professor at University of the Philippines. ""We had a live and let live situation in the South China Sea. But in 2012 they tried to seize control of Scarborough Shoal. Then in 2014 they began building the islands. The land grab by China changed the relationship.""""We have very limited capability against the threat from China,"" says former Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia Jr. He says the Chinese have repeatedly broken promises not to  militarise their new South China Sea bases. ""The Chinese have militarised those features and that puts more of our territory under threat. Only the US has the power to stop them. The Philippines cannot do it alone.""But this time there will not be thousands of US marines and airmen filling the red-light districts of Olongapo or Angeles city again. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Olongapo, close to a US naval base, was a hub for the illegal sex trade in the 1970sThe history of violence and abuse by US troops in the Philippines is still a sensitive subject.  There are an estimated 15,000 children left with their Filipino mothers when their American fathers went home. ""We have a long history of inequality in our relationship,"" says Renato Reyes, secretary general of New Patriotic Alliance, a left-wing group. ""The Philippines has been forced to shoulder the social costs. There´s a history of rape, child abuse, and of toxic waste.""The US´ return to the Philippines is strongly opposed by the country´s left-wing groups. While there won´t be as many troops as earlier, Washington is now asking for access to several new locations, some facing the South China Sea, others facing north towards Taiwan. Unofficial reports point to options in Cagayan, Zambales, Palawan and Isabela. The first one faces Taiwan, the second the Scarborough shoal, and the third the Spratly Islands. Any new US facilities will be inside existing Philippine bases. US troops will come in small groups and on rotation.The aim, says Mr Poling, will be to deter further territorial expansion by China in the South China Sea, while also providing a place for the US to watch Chinese military movements around Taiwan. ""The Philippines has no way to deter China outside this alliance,"" he says. ""It´s buying BrahMos missiles from India. The US would like to deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles. Together they can hold Chinese vessels."" With increasing concern about a conflict over Taiwan, the Philippines could offer a ""rear access area"" for US military operations, or even a place to evacuate refugees. ""People forget there are between 150,000-200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan,"" Mr Poling says. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Left-wing groups oppose a US military presence in the PhilippinesBut Manila is not about to become a full-blown member of an American alliance to challenge or resist China´s rise, Professor Kraft cautions. ""The Philippines is not doing those things like Australia and Japan, directly challenging Chinese interests in the South China Sea or East China Sea. President Marcos wants good relations with the US. But he also wants good relations with China for economic advantage."" Beijing too has indicated that it does not intend to allow a new base agreement between Manila and Washington to disrupt its relations with its neighbour. In an editorial published to coincide with the arrival of the US defence secretary in Manila, China´s state-run Global Times accused the US of ""setting a trap for the Philippines"" and ""trying to push the Philippines to the frontline of confrontation with China"".  ""We are once again being caught in the middle,"" says Mr Reyes, who believes China is just as much a capitalist imperialist power as the US. ""The Philippines still has a colonial mentality - it looks to the United States as its big brother.""

Aukus submarine deal: Is conflict with China getting closer? - BBC News,"Related TopicsAukusImage source, ReutersBy Frank GardnerBBC security correspondentChina has reacted with predictable anger to this week´s official announcement of the so-called Aukus pact. The details, unveiled on Monday in San Diego, bind together Australia, the UK and the US in a far-reaching defence and security alliance aimed at confronting Chinese military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region.""Going down a dangerous road"", ""disregarding the concerns of the international community"" and even ""risking a new arms race and nuclear proliferation"" are just some of the accusations being levelled by Beijing at this trio of western allies.Not since the US Congressional leader Nancy Pelosi made her controversial visit to Taiwan last summer has China expressed such intense disapproval of Western actions. China, the world´s most populous nation, with the world´s largest army and navy, says it is starting to feel ""penned in"" by the US and its allies in the western Pacific. In response, President Xi Jinping announced recently that China would accelerate the expansion of its defence spending and named national security as the primary concern of the coming years.Little wonder then that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke this week about a dangerous decade ahead and the need to gear up to meet the growing security challenges.So how did we get to this point and is the world drawing closer to a catastrophic conflict in the Pacific between China and the US and its allies?The West got it wrong on China. For years there was a naïve assumption in foreign ministries that China´s economic liberalisation would inevitably lead to an opening up of society and greater political freedom. As western multinational companies set up joint ventures and hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens began to enjoy a higher standard of living then surely, the reasoning went, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would loosen its grip on the population, allow some modest democratic reforms and become a fully-fledged member of the so-called ""rules-based international order"".But it hasn´t worked out that way.Yes, China has become an economic giant, a vital, integral part of the global supply chain and the most important trading partner for countries all over the world. But instead of coupling this with a shift towards democracy and liberalisation, Beijing has embarked on a course that has alarmed both Western governments and many of its neighbours like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.Such as? The list is long but here are the main bones of contention between China and the West:Taiwan: China has repeatedly vowed to take over this self-governing island, by force if necessary. US President Joe Biden has said the US would come to its defence, although official US policy doesn´t commit to military actionThe South China Sea: In recent years China has used its huge navy to colonise parts of the South China Sea, claiming it as its own territory, contrary to international lawTechnology: China is increasingly accused of secretly harvesting vast amounts of personal data as well as stealing intellectual property to gain commercial advantageHong Kong: Beijing has successfully crushed democracy in the former British colony, handing down lengthy jail sentences to activistsThe Uyghur Muslims: Satellite data and eye-witness accounts point to the forced internment of up to one million Uyghur Muslims in camps across Xinjiang provinceMilitarily, China today is a force to be reckoned with. In recent years its People´s Liberation Army has made enormous strides in technology and innovation as well as numbers. China´s Dong Feng hypersonic missiles, for example, can travel at speeds in excess of Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), armed with either a high explosive or nuclear warhead. This is giving the US Navy´s 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, pause for thought as to just how close it is prepared to risk sailing to China´s massed missile batteries onshore.On nuclear ballistic missiles too, China has embarked on a programme of rapid expansion, aiming to treble its number of warheads as it builds new silos out in remote western regions. None of this though, means that China wants to go to war. It doesn´t. When it comes to Taiwan, it would much prefer to exert enough pressure on it that it capitulates and submits to Beijing´s rule without a shot being fired. On Hong Kong, the Uyghurs and intellectual property it knows that over time the criticism will die down because trade with China is simply too important for the rest of the world. So although tensions are high right now, and there could well be flashpoints still to come, both sides - China and the West - know that a war in the Pacific would be catastrophic for everyone and despite the angry rhetoric, it is in absolutely no-one´s interests.Related TopicsChinaAukus",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64959500,14,03,2023,bbc,china

Tawang: The Indian monastery town coveted by China - BBC News,"Image source, AFPImage caption, Tawang, a centre for Buddhism, has long been the focus of tensions between India and ChinaBy Anbarasan EthirajanBBC NewsHigh in the Himalayas, the holy town of Tawang is one of the most intractable issues in the border dispute between India and China - and a potential flashpoint for future conflict.Along snow-capped ridges to its north, soldiers from Asia´s two biggest armies face off, sometimes just a few hundred metres apart. Last December, they clashed in what some experts saw as a worrying sign of how things could escalate.Tawang, a pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhists perched some 3,000m (10,000ft) above sea level, is home to India´s largest Buddhist monastery. For this reason and because of its strategic location, it´s long been the focus of tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.The town is claimed by China. Tibet, annexed by China in 1950, lies just 35km (22 miles) to the north. ""It´s not just the Tawang sector,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People´s Liberation Army, told the BBC. ""The entire Arunachal Pradesh [state], which we call southern Tibet, has been illegally occupied by India - it´s non-negotiable.""Image caption, December´s clash is reported to have taken place not far from Chumi Gyatse waterfall near the borderTawang hit the headlines in December after the first clashes there in years. India said Chinese soldiers encroached into its territory and ""unilaterally tried to change the status quo"". China said its troops were on routine patrol on their side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which separates Chinese and Indian held territory, and had been ""blocked by the Indian army illegally crossing the line"".  The fight that ensued reportedly left several soldiers injured on both sides. It followed a far more serious clash in 2020 at the other end of the disputed frontier. In a mass brawl in Ladakh´s Galwan valley, 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed - it was the first fatal confrontation over the border in 45 years and highlighted the risks faced as the rivals try to further their strategic goals. Image caption, With special permits, India allows domestic tourists all the way up to Bum La Pass, on the border with ChinaSince then, tensions have escalated, with both sides deploying tens of thousands of troops with heavy armaments along the disputed border. Claims are being reinforced in other ways too. In mid-February India announced plans to invest in more than 660 ""vibrant villages"" to encourage locals near the border to stay. The move was seen as a response to reports of model villages on China´s side.India is also promoting tourism in Arunachal Pradesh with hotels, restaurants and home-stays springing up in Tawang and surrounding areas. India and China share a frontier that isn´t fully demarcated, and have overlapping territorial claims. India says it is 3,488km long; China puts it at around 2,000km.Of all the disputed areas, Tawang remains high up on China´s list of claims.It was among areas taken during a brief war in 1962 that ended in a humiliating defeat for India. Thousands of PLA troops overran Indian positions before withdrawing.""Tawang is indispensable to China. The Tibetan spiritual leader the sixth Dalai Lama was born there [in the 17th Century],"" said Mr Zhou, who attended India-China border talks as a military expert in the mid-1990s. ""What better evidence do you need to prove that it´s Chinese territory?""India asserts its boundary claim based on the 1914 McMahon line, named after the British foreign secretary of colonial India.China refuses to accept the line - it runs from the east of Bhutan across the Himalayas and puts the whole of Arunachal Pradesh on the Indian side.

When the current Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, he reached Tawang first after crossing mountains by foot. There´s also suspicion among some Chinese observers that given the ethnic link between the cross-border communities, Tawang could be used to whip up any future Tibetan uprising.India and China race to build along a tense frontierChina and India face off on the roof of the worldImages ´show China structures´ on India borderChina´s claims to Arunachal Pradesh have become more assertive over the past 20 years, but it appears it´s been willing to trade.Liu Zongyi, a senior fellow at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, says Tawang was central to a deal China offered India during talks in 2006.""On the premise of recovering Tawang, China was willing to give up its claim for sovereignty over most parts of southern Tibet [Arunachal Pradesh]… in exchange for India´s recognition of China´s sovereignty and control over Aksai Chin,"" Mr Liu told the BBC.He said the offer didn´t succeed because India hadn´t been willing to give up its interests in the east, especially over Tawang, and was also not ready to make concessions on Aksai Chin - currently under Chinese control.Image source, AFPImage caption, A Chinese soldier stands guard at the poorly demarcated border, which stretches several thousand kilometresShyam Saran, India´s foreign secretary at that time, said he didn´t remember any such proposal.""We never got down to any bargaining on how much territory you are willing to give up, how much territory we are willing to trade off. That stage never came up,"" Mr Saran said.Border negotiations have continued in the years since, but made no progress. The two sides met in Beijing in February for their first in-person talks in three years.India´s official position remains maintaining the status quo until a final settlement, but Chinese observers are wary.Mr Zhou, the former PLA officer, says Indian intransigence has generated suspicion.""In China there are some people who say the Indian attitude is like - mine is mine and yours is also mine. They believe that as India is in control of the eastern sector, therefore they are trying their best to grab more land in the west in Ladakh,"" Mr Zhou said. According to Mr Liu, India has over decades adopted an ""offensive defence policy, constantly encroaching on Chinese territory across the LAC and occupying the military commanding heights in the border areas"".Image source, AFPImage caption, Indian troops near the Line of Actual Control in Tawang sectorSuch remarks mirror criticisms of China´s approach to territory that India regards as its own. ""The Chinese keep moving the goal posts or shifting their position,"" says Mr Saran.With both sides showing little flexibility, Mr Zhou thinks resolving the border dispute should be left to the future.But many in India feel a delay could only be advantageous to China, which has vastly increased its military and economic might in the last few decades.""As the power asymmetry between the two sides keeps growing, I think we should expect a much more assertive China,"" said Mr Saran.No one expects a war to break out anytime soon, given how much India and China value their strong trade relations. But neither shows any sign of compromise. As both sides vie for control on the ground, clashes like the recent one near Tawang only become more likely - all it would need is a spark for things to flare up.BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Sri Lanka's central bank urges China and India to reduce its debts - BBC News,"Image source, Jack GarlandBy Ben ChuEconomics editor, NewsnightSri Lanka´s central bank has urged China and India to agree a write-down of their loans as soon as possible.The crisis-hit Indian Ocean state defaulted on its debt repayments and negotiated a $2.9bn (£2.4bn) bailout.But the International Monetary Fund will not release the cash until China and India first agree to reduce Sri Lanka´s billions of dollars of debt.The governor of Sri Lanka´s central bank told BBC Newsnight it was in the interest of all parties to act quickly.P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said: ""The sooner they give us finance assurances that would be better for both [sides], as a creditor, as a debtor.""""That will help us to start repaying their obligations,"" he added.""We don´t want to be in this kind of situation, not meeting the obligations, for too long. That is not good for the country and for us. That´s not good for investor confidence in Sri Lanka.""Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?Though inflation in the country has eased slightly since last year, food prices in Sri Lanka last month were still 65% higher than a year earlier.The World Food Programme estimates that 8 million Sri Lankans - more than a third of the population - are ""food insecure"", with hunger especially concentrated in rural areas.The economic turmoil sparked mass protests last year, which resulted in the former president fleeing the country in July.Image source, Jack GarlandImage caption, The governor of Sri Lanka´s central bank P. Nandalal Weerasinghe urged China and India to act quicklyThe World Bank estimates that Sri Lanka´s economy shrank by 9.2% in 2022 and that it will contract by a further 4.2% this year.Beijing´s lending to Sri Lanka stands at around $7bn while India is owed around $1bn.The Sri Lankan government had initially hoped to agree a new payment plan with China and India by the end of 2022.Sri Lanka´s protesters have gone silent - for nowMr Weerasinghe said it was possible an agreement could come later in January but added ""this all depends on the other parties - our creditors really have to make that decision"".He added that Sri Lanka had now provided them with all the information on the country´s borrowings they needed.Independent analysts say China is concerned about what a substantial Sri Lankan debt write down could mean for its extensive lending to other developing countries through its Belt and Road programme.Meanwhile, India is said to be wary of getting inferior terms on debt restructuring to China, its regional rival.Image source, Jack GarlandImage caption, The US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung said Sri Lanka had no time to delay in resolving its debtsThe US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, said the greater onus to move was on China, as the biggest bilateral lender.""We hope that they do not delay because Sri Lanka does not have time to delay. They need these assurances immediately,"" ambassador Chung told BBC Newsnight.""For the sake of the Sri Lankan people, we certainly hope China is not a spoiler as they proceed to attain this IMF agreement.""But if India and China do ultimately agree to write down their loans to Sri Lanka another potential problem looms in the form of private creditors, who account for 40% of the country´s external debt stock.In the years after Argentina plunged into economic crisis and default in 2001, some American hedge funds, rather than accepting a restructuring of the sovereign bonds they had bought on the open market, demanded full repayment and took the country´s government to court in the US to achieve it.A large group of international economists on 8 January called for Sri Lanka´s bonds, to be ""cancelled"", writing: ""All of Sri Lanka´s creditors must ensure debt cancellation sufficient to provide a way out of the current crisis.""Asked about Sri Lanka´s private bondholders, Mr Weerasinghe said: ""We engage with private creditors in good faith negotiations. And what we are seeing is that they are very positive and they are willing to engage with us.""The governor said he expected that once agreement from bilateral creditors has been agreed the IMF funds could be distributed to Sri Lanka within ""four to six weeks"".Additional reporting by Jack Garland and Scarlett Barter.Newsnight Global is broadcast from Sri Lanka on Thursday 12 JanuaryRelated TopicsSri Lanka",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64232166,12,01,2023,bbc,china
China's population falls for first time since 1961 - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s birth rate has hit a record lowBy Kelly NgBBC NewsChina´s population has fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the national birth rate hitting a record low - 6.77 births per 1,000 people. The population in 2022 - 1.4118 billion - fell by 850,000 from 2021.China´s birth rate has been declining for years, prompting a slew of policies to try to slow the trend. But seven years after scrapping the one-child policy, it has entered what one official described as an ""era of negative population growth"". The birth rate in 2022 was also down from 7.52 in 2021, according to China´s National Bureau of Statistics, which released the figures on Tuesday. In comparison, in 2021, the United States recorded 11.06 births per 1,000 people, and the United Kingdom, 10.08 births. The birth rate for the same year in India, which is poised to overtake China as the world´s most populous country, was 16.42.Deaths also outnumbered births for the first time last year in China. The country logged its highest death rate since 1976 - 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, up from 7.18 the previous year.Why don´t Chinese women want more babies?What it will mean when Indians outnumber ChineseDoes China´s ´one-child generation´ want more kids?Earlier government data had heralded a demographic crisis, which would in the long run shrink China´s labour force and increase the burden on healthcare and other social security costs. Results from a once-a-decade census announced in 2021 showed China´s population growing at its slowest pace in decades. Populations are also shrinking and ageing in other East Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea.   ""This trend is going to continue and perhaps worsen after Covid,"" says Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ms Su is among experts who expect China´s population to shrink further through 2023. ""The high youth unemployment rate and weaknesses in income expectations could delay marriage and childbirth plans further, dragging down the number of newborns,"" she added. And the death rate in 2023 is likely to be higher than it was pre-pandemic due to Covid infections, she said. China has seen a surge of cases since it abandoned its zero-Covid policy last month. China´s population trends over the years have been largely shaped by the controversial one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules were fined and, in some cases, even lost jobs. In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, the policy had also led to forced abortions and a reportedly skewed gender ratio from the 1980s.The policy was scrapped in 2016 and married couples were allowed to have two children. In recent years, the Chinese government also offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare, among other incentives, to reverse, or at least slow, the falling birth rate. But these policies did not lead to a sustained increase in the births. Some experts say this is because policies that encouraged childbirth were not accompanied by efforts to ease the burden of childcare, such as more help for working mothers or access to education. In October 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping made boosting birth rates a priority. Mr Xi said in a once-in-five-year Communist Party Congress in Beijing that his government would ""pursue a proactive national strategy"" in response to the country´s ageing population.Apart from dishing out incentives to have children, China should also improve gender equality in households and workplaces, said Bussarawan Teerawichitchainan, director of the National University of Singapore´s Centre for Family and Population Research. BBC Future: Are there too many people? Scandinavian countries have shown that such moves can improve fertility rates, she added. According to Paul Cheung, Singapore´s former chief statistician, China has ""plenty of manpower"" and ""a lot of lead time"" to manage the demographic challenge. ""They are not in a doomsday scenario right away,"" he said.Observers also say merely raising birth rates will not resolve the problems behind China´s slowing growth.""Boosting fertility is not going to improve productivity or increase domestic consumption in the medium term,"" said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a public policy professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""How China will respond to these structural issues would be more crucial.""

"The trip that transformed Australia and China ties, five decades on - BBC News","Image source, Stephen FitzgeraldImage caption, Gough Whitlam (fourth from left) led a historic Australian delegation to China in 1971By Tiffanie TurnbullBBC News, SydneyA young Australian researcher was having a late-morning drink in a Canberra pub in 1971 when he received a phone call that changed his life.""The pub called out: ´Is there someone here called Stephen FitzGerald?´""One of Australia´s most powerful politicians - future prime minister Gough Whitlam - was on the line.Mr Whitlam, then opposition leader, asked the China expert whether he would join him for a historic diplomatic mission to the country.""I said yes, of course I would!"" Dr FitzGerald told the BBC.""Then he said in his kind of inimitable wisdom: ´Would you mind travelling economy class?´""That moment would help set the ball rolling for Australia to forge diplomatic ties with China. It achieved that 50 years ago - on 21 December 1972.´Deeply divisive´ issueThe trip was a risky political move for Mr Whitlam.In 1971 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was forcing its way on to the world stage amid the Cold War, seeking improved foreign relationships and a seat at the United Nations.But it faced hurdles from key players like the US, which refused to recognise the CCP as China´s legitimate government.Australia was one such nation. China remained a ""deeply divisive"" issue there, Dr FitzGerald says. At the time, just 3% of its population was born outside Australia or Europe - and many people were suspicious of other cultures. The ""red menace"" of communism was also a great concern. Such fears intersected over China.For many, it resonated when Australia´s conservative government spoke of the threat posed by the ""downward thrust of China"", Dr FitzGerald says. It was easy to ""conjure up the idea of Australia being taken over by Chinese, and not just Chinese, but Chinese who were communist"".""It was a powerful message… even though it was not remotely possible.""Image source, The Whitlam InstituteImage caption, Dr FitzGerald has studied China for decadesOn the other hand, Mr Whitlam had long advocated for Australia to take up relations with China.It was not because of any ideological sympathy for the CCP, Dr FitzGerald says. ""You don´t have to like them... [But] his view was, how can you not have diplomatic relations with the government of a country of that size?""But even within Mr Whitlam´s Labor Party, many regarded any step towards China as ""political death"" domestically.""So it took courage on many fronts,"" Dr FitzGerald says.The accidental ambassadorMr Whitlam´s path to China may have seemed inevitable, but Dr FitzGerald´s was somewhat of a fluke.He didn´t choose to study China. It all snowballed from the moment he was assigned Chinese language classes on his first day as a foreign service cadet. And by the time Mr Whitlam came calling, Dr FitzGerald had left for a career in academia.But if the invitation was a surprise, the trip itself felt even more surreal.""In those days you had to walk into China, there were no flights,"" Dr FitzGerald says. ""We had to go to Hong Kong, take the train up to the border, carry our luggage across, go through immigration and customs on the Chinese side and then board another train.""The delegation toured businesses, factories, schools and tourist sites for two weeks. Dr FitzGerald recalls constantly explaining Australian sense of humour to ""mystified"" Chinese officials.But the real goal of the mission was to meet then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. It was never clear if that would happen - until Chinese officials arrived at the Australians´ hotel late one night and began ushering people into cars.""We drove across the empty Beijing streets to the Great Hall of the People, went up the stairs, through dimly lit corridors into a room, and Zhou Enlai was standing there,"" Dr FitzGerald says.When the much-anticipated meeting began, Mr Zhou surprised the delegation by inviting journalists to stay in the room.Image source, Stephen FitzgeraldImage caption, Gough Whitlam (second from left) speaking with Zhou Enlai (right)The meeting transformed Australia´s feelings towards China. ""The Chinese had been demonised as a cross between red devils and yellow perils - almost as if they had horns. And here was this most sophisticated and civilised, polite and diplomatic, courteous, charming person.""When I watched that meeting between Whitlam and Zhou Enlai, I concluded that relations with China would never be the same again.""All that stood between us and diplomatic relations at that stage was the election during December of 1972.""Mr Whitlam did win the election, ending 23 years of conservative rule. Within weeks, on 21 December, he recognised the People´s Republic of China.Soon after, he sent Dr FitzGerald to Beijing as Australia´s first ambassador to the country. Just 34 at the time, he remains Australia´s youngest ambassador ever.""Of course it was daunting. It couldn´t not be,"" he says. ""But I think that sense was really overwhelmed by the excitement.""Image source, Stephen FitzgeraldImage caption, Mr Whitlam and Dr FitzGerald meet Mao Zedong in 1973Mr Whitlam´s hope was that Australia would build a relationship with China that was comparable to those it had with other major powers, Dr FitzGerald says.But 50 years on, that´s not where things are.Lessons for today?Australia and China have benefited enormously from trade with each other, but bilateral relations have sunk to record lows in recent times. High-level contact was cut off for two years, amid disputes over trade, human rights and foreign interference.But last month Prime Minister Anthony Albanese - who was elected in May - became the first Australian leader to have a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2016.He said it was a ""warm"" and ""very constructive"" chat, but there was no movement on key issues for Australia. Many experts have little optimism that the relationship will significantly improve any time soon.Is China really open to making up with Australia?The year when Australia and China hit ´lowest ebb´Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow at Australia´s Lowy Institute thinktank, told the BBC at the time that too many points of conflict remain. Many of them, she says, are rooted in ""fundamental"" differences such as systems of government or values.""Those issues aren´t going to be resolved by one meeting or even several meetings.""Another such meeting will take place on Wednesday when Australia´s Foreign Minister Penny Wong meets her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Beijing. It marks the first visit by an Australian minister to China´s capital in more than three years.Dr FitzGerald says the China of today seems more ""dictatorially minded"" and ""assertive"", but he still thinks there are lessons in what transpired 50 years ago.""The [Whitlam] government recognised that no matter what has happened, you still have to have relations with the government in that country.""It didn´t mean that everything was sweetness and light, but it meant that we were talking with each other.""Related TopicsChinaAustralia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-63912368,20,12,2022,bbc,china
Zhao Lijian: China reassigns combative ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomat - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Former Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has been demotedBy Nicholas YongBBC NewsA controversial Chinese diplomat who epitomised China´s ""Wolf Warrior"" approach to diplomacy has been moved to a less prominent post.Ex-foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian is now deputy head of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs. He will help manage China´s maritime and land boundaries. It is unclear when he took up his new role.A high profile figure, Mr Zhao often hosted the ministry´s media briefings.The reason for his unexpected transfer is unclear. He was considered the leading light of ""Wolf Warrior"" diplomacy, defined by its confrontational, combative approach, a stark contrast to the previously restrained brand of Chinese diplomacy.It is named after the highly popular, often jingoistic, movie franchise about the adventures of a Chinese special forces soldier.In three years as foreign ministry spokesman Mr Zhao often courted controversy with his tweets. In 2020, Mr Zhao suggested that the coronavirus which causes Covid was manufactured by the US military and brought to China. That same year, he set off a diplomatic furore when he posted a doctored image of an Australian soldier killing an Afghan child.The year before, former US national security adviser Susan Rice called the 50-year-old a ""racist disgrace"" after he fired off a series of provocative tweets about race relations in the US. Mr Zhao´s reassignment coincides with China´s former ambassador to the US Qin Gang becoming China´s new foreign minister.However some observers have cautioned against seeing Mr Zhao´s move as signifying that China was moving away from combative diplomacy. Writing on his Sinocism blog, US journalist Bill Bishop said the approach appeared to be a ""fundamental tenet"" of leader Xi Jinping´s style of diplomacy and while Mr Zhao was ""one of the cruder mouthpieces"" there was no evidence so far of any broader shift.China’s new brand of tough-talking diplomatsThe nationalist action film storming ChinaSome internet users have also speculated that the social media posts of Mr Zhao´s wife Tang Tianru may have something to do with his apparent demotion. Multiple photos of Ms Tang apparently attending public events in Beijing without a mask were posted on the account at a time when China was subject to the strictest Covid curbs in the world. Pictures also purportedly showed Ms Tang travelling in Germany despite the travel restrictions then in force.Last November, Mr Zhao was uncharacteristically caught at a loss for words when asked in a press conference whether China would continue its zero-Covid policies amid rare protests in the country. After a long pause, he asked for the question to be repeated before saying that the query did ""not reflect what actually happened"".The role of foreign ministry spokesperson is considered to be a prominent role that has in the past led to further promotion. China´s newly-appointed foreign minister Mr Qin served as spokesperson before he was promoted inside the ministry and then given the prestigious US ambassadorship.Meanwhile Mr Zhao´s ex-colleague Hua Chunying, who has been a spokesperson since 2012, was promoted to assistant minister of foreign affairs in 2021.Related TopicsChinaTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished27 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

China and the Ukraine war: The real reason for Beijing's charm offensive - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Wang Yi struck a friendly pose for Hungarian media as he met Foreign and Trade Minister Peter SzijjartoBy Tessa WongBBC News, Asia Digital ReporterOver the past year, leaders in the West have tried to cajole China to help them end the Ukraine war. Now Beijing has given its firmest response yet - and it´s not something many in the West would like.In recent days, China has launched an assertive charm offensive, kicking off with top diplomat Wang Yi´s tour of Europe, which culminated in a warm welcome by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Beijing has released not one but two position papers - the first offering the Chinese solution to the war, and the other outlining a plan for world peace. These largely retread China´s talking points from the past year, calling for respect for sovereignty (for Ukraine) and the protection of national security interests (for Russia), while opposing the use of unilateral sanctions (by the US). The West may come away unimpressed - but convincing them was never likely the main goal for Beijing.China´s goal: send a clear message to USFirstly, it clearly seeks to position itself as a global peacemaker. An obvious clue about who it´s really trying to charm lies in one of its papers, where it mentions engaging South East Asia, Africa and South America - the so-called Global South. In preaching an alternative vision to a US-led world order, it is wooing the rest of the globe, which is watching to see how the West handles the Ukraine crisis.But another goal is to send a clear message to the US. ""There is an element of defiance,"" said Alexander Korolev, an expert in Sino-Russian ties at the University of New South Wales. ""It is signalling: ´If things get ugly between us, I have someone to go to. Russia is not alone, which means that I will not be alone when there is a confrontation… don´t get comfortable in bullying me.´""The timing, say observers, is a giveaway. Relations between the US and China have hit a new low, exacerbated by the spy balloon saga. Some have also questioned why China - if its intention is to help end the war - is only just now making its big diplomatic push for Ukraine peace.""China had ample opportunities to display leadership, it was invited early on to contribute to ending the war… If the goal was to truly display the image of a global leader, you don´t have to sit on the fence for one year and try to perform a diplomatic dance,"" said Dr Korolev.There was a third goal, and it could be seen in Mr Wang´s itinerary. By visiting France, Germany, Italy and Hungary, whose leaders China perceives as taking less of a hardline stance on Russia, Mr Wang may have been testing the waters to see if China could lure some of Europe into China´s orbit.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsBeijing sees a ""logical convergence of interests"" with these countries, said Zhang Xin, an international political economy expert with the East China Normal University in Shanghai. ""It believes the US has hegemonic power, and that a large part of the Transatlantic world could benefit from detaching from that system.""But whether China will succeed in that particular goal is questionable. Mr Wang´s speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he criticised the US, did not play well in a roomful of America´s staunchest allies and, according to diplomats, only spawned greater distrust of China´s true motives.His tour ""was a very overt push to say: ´We don´t have problems with Europe, we have problems with the US, we can fix things with you Europeans and you need to understand that the US is leading you down a problematic road´"", said Andrew Small, a senior fellow specialising in Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank.""But I think in most places in Europe, this message doesn´t have much traction.""Zelensky wants to meet Xi Jinping to discuss peace planThe key question now is whether Beijing will live up to its word of making peace as it tightens its embrace of Russia. The US has warned this week that China was considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia, and that Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.Publicly China has reacted with angry rhetoric. But behind closed doors, Mr Wang made it clear to top EU official Josep Borrell that it will not provide weapons to Russia.Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Mr Wang in MoscowAccording to Mr Borrell, Mr Wang had also asked: ""Why do you show concern for me maybe providing arms to Russia when you are providing arms to Ukraine?"" It is a revealing line, say observers, showing that Beijing still truly believes the West is to blame for fuelling the war. ""Sending weapons to any warring party is considered as further escalation - that is the position of the Chinese state so far,"" said Dr Zhang.There is scepticism that Beijing would supply weapons to Moscow, given how it runs counter to Chinese interests.Such a move would be seen by others as a clear escalation of the war, and would lead to sanctions and disruption of trade with the West - hugely damaging for China, as the EU and US are among its top trading partners. It would also raise global tensions significantly and likely push US allies further into Washington´s embrace, stymieing Beijing´s plan to woo some of them away. What is more likely to happen, say observers, is that Beijing will continue or even step up indirect support to Russia, such as boosting economic trade - which has provided a financial lifeline to Moscow - and abstaining from sanctions on Russia.What support is China giving Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?They may even supply more dual-use technology through third party states such as Iran or North Korea, according to Dr Small, so that they can lend support ""as deniably as possible"".But as the war drags on, the issue of giving lethal weapons will resurface, he warned. ""There hasn´t been a question yet on what kind of significant things China could be asked to do, because previously Russia didn´t need to resupply,"" said Dr Small. ""But they are hitting that juncture. How long is China willing to say to Russia it will not do it?""Days before the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin declared they had a ""friendship without limits"". A year on, China will have to answer the question of how far it would go for its special friend.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warAsiaChinaRussiaUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64754510,24,02,2023,bbc,china

China-Taiwan: Concern at repair of Taiwanese military device in China - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, File photo of a Hsiung Feng III missileBy Fan WangBBC News There are calls for greater safeguards in Taiwan after at least one device used by the military for its missiles was sent for repair in China.An optical instrument used for launch measurements for Taiwan´s Hsiung-Feng III anti-ship missiles was shipped to its manufacturer in Europe. It was then sent back to Taiwan from Shandong province in eastern China, Taiwanese media reported.Last year Beijing intensified military activity around the island.China sees Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to unify to it by force if necessary. Self-ruled Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the mainland.President Tsai Ing-wen has announced new plans to bolster Taiwan´s defence in the event of an attack from Beijing, including extending mandatory military service from four months to one year.In a statement, Taiwanese missile developer the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology said the device had been shipped to Switzerland by the company that had originally supplied it to the Taiwanese military. From there it was diverted for repair at the manufacturer´s Asia maintenance centre in the Chinese city of Qingdao, it said.The institute said it had removed memory cards before sending it to Europe and had also run information security checks on the device after its return and had no concerns over possible information leaks.Dr Su Tzu-yun from Taiwan´s Institute of Defence Security Research said the optical devices were not direct missile components but said Taiwan had to be more careful anyway.""Taiwan must be more strict and careful in its contract management,"" he said. ""Of course we would not want such equipment to be sent to China for repair.""The tool, a theodolite, is used to measure precise geographical location for missile launches as well as the angle and direction of the launchers, Dr Su said.""It´s like when you buy a computer, it´s a device you put on the desk to go with the machine,"" he said.Can a billionaire inspire ordinary Taiwanese to fight?Why Taiwanese are among Ukraine´s foreign fightersHe suggested that the manufacturer had not been aware the devices, purchased by a supplier in Taiwan, had subsequently been used for military purposes.It is not the first time concerns over the security of Taiwan´s missile programme have been raised. Last year, three people at two Taiwanese suppliers were sentenced to between four and 10 years in prison for using products from China to fake missile components supposedly to be made by US manufacturers.

Tense US-China meeting deepens balloon row - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Biden said he would ""make no apologies"" for shooting down the balloonBy Tessa WongBBC News, Asia Digital ReporterAs the rift between the US and China over the balloon saga widens, so has the divide within the global community scrutinising their high-stakes dispute.The latest testy exchange took place on Saturday, when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met China´s top diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, in the first high-level meeting since the row began.Mr Blinken said they would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"".China continues to deny that they sent a spy balloon, even as the US continues to disclose more details of the object to back up their allegation. But beyond the dispute, the way both Beijing and Washington have responded to each other has come under close examination as the world grapples with the incident´s implications for national security and geopolitical stability.The net result, say observers, is that it has hardened positions - deepening distrust among those wary of China or the US - and made it significantly harder for Washington and Beijing to close the gap between them.How has China reacted to the balloon saga?Balloon saga deflates efforts to mend US-China relationsFor some, the incident has heightened anxieties over the reach of Chinese espionage, as governments scramble to reassess what they know of China´s surveillance capabilities. The US claims Chinese military balloons have crossed the airspace of more than 40 countries across five continents.This week Japan - a key US ally - announced that after they had re-analysed past cases of unidentified flying objects, they ""strongly suspect"" that China had flown at least three spy balloons across their territory since 2019.A Financial Times report quoted unnamed Taiwanese officials saying the island - another US ally, and one that is claimed by China - had been spied on by dozens of Chinese military balloons. Taiwan´s defence ministry later clarified it had only spotted Chinese weather balloons - on Friday it found the remnants of one such object - but also warned they would not hesitate to shoot down any suspected military objects in its airspace. ""For other states, they didn´t know what to make of it previously, but now they do. So it shows a gap in understanding on the part of other states, and not surprisingly China has sought to exploit the gap,"" said Dr Ian Chong, a non-resident scholar at Carnegie China.For those convinced of the US allegations, the incident has highlighted an underestimation of China´s surveillance capability - and the lengths Beijing would go to prove it. ""It certainly indicates the People´s Liberation Army feels they can justify absolutely any technology and any mission, that they can do anything to increase China´s ability to project power, conduct surveillance, and hold the US at risk,"" said Mr Drew Thompson, a former US Department of Defense official and a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore.This, said Mr Thompson, was done ""regardless of the consequences to China´s reputation, its obligation and adherence to international law, and without considering the benefits of acting with restraint"".Noting there has been a lack of a concerted outcry and pushback from the global community, Mr Thompson said this demonstrated ""a fragility of international law"" and was a ""testament to China´s ability to deter other countries from criticising them"", and could lead to a more unsafe world.Beijing undermined its own attempts to win trust and project the image of a responsible superpower with the way it has responded in the saga, according to some observers.China has yet to divulge details backing up its claim that the balloon was a civilian meteorological airship, such as the name of the company that operated it. ""This lack of transparency has only created more questions, and has given those who are already sceptical a reason to be even more so,"" said Dr Chong.Beijing´s subsequent claim that the US has in the past flown more than 10 spy balloons into China - which Washington has denied - was also ""confusing"", he added.""Is China suggesting that floating lots of balloons over each other´s territory has been an accepted practice?"" asked Dr Chong, who pointed out that if this were the case, it would contradict Beijing´s long-held insistence on the respect for sovereignty.The claim could be seen as a case of China deflecting and engaging in ""whataboutism"", said Mr Thompson, which is a way of responding to an accusation by proffering a counter-accusation.But the way the US has reacted has also unnerved some, particularly those who side with China.This week, US officials admitted that three other objects they shot out of the sky in North America were not likely foreign spy crafts. US President Joe Biden defended the decision as necessary to protect commercial air traffic, and also because at that time they ""could not rule out the surveillance risk of sensitive facilities"".Victor Gao, vice-president of Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization, called the shootings an ""overreaction"" that could be seen as the US ""acting increasingly hysterical"". ""China has been very professional and responsible, explaining the situation to the US and the whole world and asking for co-operation rather than confrontation. This is in contrast to the jingoism of the US - they should remember they are not shooting buffalo in the Wild West, they are shooting down an object that China owns,"" he said.Others have praised the US´ handling of the incident, with Australia´s deputy PM Richard Marles calling the shootdown of the Chinese balloon ""a very measured way"" of responding to the incursion.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Happier times: Mr Xi and Mr Biden greeted each other warmly at the G20 summit in Bali in NovemberWith both sides doubling down, what is clear is that the balloon blow-up has made reconciliation even harder.For the Chinese, the shootdown and Mr Biden´s refusal to apologise has set a precedent, warned Mr Gao.""They would need to be prepared for similar acts of retaliation against similar objects in Chinese space… Don´t complain that China doesn´t apologise, if such an unfortunate incident happens again,"" he said.He pointed out that it may even push China to take a stronger stance against US planes and ships in airspace and waters which China considers as theirs, such as Taiwan. The US Navy routinely conducts what it calls ""freedom of navigation"" exercises by sailing its military ships through the Taiwan Strait.But there are signs of a willingness to engage. Mr Biden said he plans on calling Chinese president Xi Jinping soon to discuss the incident.Both leaders face domestic pressure to not be seen as backing down. As the balloon saga drifts on, the question now is how much political capital both leaders would be willing to spend to deflate tensions.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsRelated TopicsChinaUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64673926,19,02,2023,bbc,china
Elderly in China protest over slashed health benefits - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Reuters/ Social media grabImage caption, This is the second round of protests in seven days in WuhanBy Stephen McDonellChina correspondent Crowds of retirees in China have again taken to the streets to protest against cuts to their medical benefits. They gathered on Wednesday for a second time in Wuhan, where Covid was first detected, and also in the north-eastern city of Dalian.The second round of protests in seven days puts pressure on President Xi Jinping´s administration just weeks before the annual National People´s Congress, which will usher in a new leadership team.Protests first took place in Wuhan on 8 February after provincial authorities said they were cutting the level of medical expenses which retirees can claim back from the government. Social media footage shows the protesters to be largely elderly retirees, who say this comes at a time of soaring healthcare costs. Although such health insurance matters are handled at a provincial level, protests have spread to different parts of the country in what appears to be a renewed belief in the power of demonstrating in China.At the end of last year, thousands of young Chinese took part in protests that eventually forced the government to overturn its strict zero-Covid measures - people had grown weary of the mass testing and sudden, sweeping lockdowns that had been smashing the economy. But the abrupt change in policy placed China´s medical system under enormous strain, as the coronavirus quickly spread through the country. It led to an unknown number of deaths and reporting by the BBC appeared to show that a vast majority of those who died were elderly. The changes to health benefits for retirees, which officials have described as reforms, come just as China emerges from that brutal Covid wave. The plan has been sold as a means of trading off reimbursement levels to increase the scope of coverage to include more areas. However criticism of plan on social media has included the widely held view that Chinese officials are trying to recoup the vast amounts of money spent on compulsory Covid testing and other pandemic measures.Officials in both Wuhan and Dalian said they had no knowledge of the most recent protests and, as such, had no comment to make. Calls to local police stations went unanswered.Radio Free Asia reported that retired iron and steel workers made up a significant proportion of the original protest group in Wuhan. The use of existing social network links could help to explain how these gatherings have been coordinated in a country where organising dissent against the government in any form is difficult and can lead to severe punishment, including prison sentences.Video clips shared on social media showed elderly protestors singing the global Communist anthem, the Internationale. In the past, this song has been used as a means of indicating that demonstrators are not against the government or the Communist Party but merely want their grievances resolved.A shopkeeper who witnessed this Wednesday´s protest in Wuhan told the BBC that police on both sides of a nearby road had blocked access to the area in order to prevent more people joining the hundreds of elderly demonstrators who were already chanting slogans.Three years of the pandemic crisis followed by a tumultuous exit from zero-Covid have generated considerable public discontent over China´s health policies. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s zero-Covid measures involved mass testingMr Xi had given the country´s Covid amelioration policies his personal stamp of approval and the Party has struggled to explain why such a sudden about-face was necessary.The Chinese government had also publicly ridiculed other countries for opening up too early, claiming they had unnecessarily sacrificed their people as a result.It then turned around and abandoned its own restrictions at an even greater speed than other nations had done, and did so after maintaining lockdowns and other harsh measures for much longer than anywhere else in the world.Many here now believe that, as a result, livelihoods were unnecessarily destroyed.On China´s Twitter-like Weibo social media platform, the hashtag #healthinsurance - in Chinese - has attracted millions of hits but was removed from the site´s ""hot topics"" section.The hashtag matching the site of the most recent protests in Wuhan - Zhongshan Park - was censored and photos claiming to be of the demonstration have been removed. However, even with China´s vast censorship apparatus swinging into action, a large amount of support is still being expressed for the protesting retirees on social media.Beijing will need to find a way to resolve the issue if it wants to avoid further public agitation.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemicTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished27 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

"China coronavirus: 60,000 Covid-related deaths in just over a month - BBC News","Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, WU HAO/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockChina has reported 60,000 Covid-related deaths in just over a month, the first major death toll released since the country stopped its zero-Covid policy. China has been widely accused of underreporting coronavirus deaths, despite evidence of hospitals and crematoriums being overrun. According to officials, China recorded 59,938 Covid-related deaths between 8 December and 12 January. Most of those who died were over 80, with most having underlying conditions.The figures, include 5,503 deaths caused by respiratory failure directly due to the virus, and 54,435 caused by underlying conditions combined with the virus. The real total is likely to be higher because which the figures refer only to deaths recorded at medical facilities.Image source, Tingshu Wang/ReutersLast month, Beijing changed the way it categorises Covid deaths, only counting towards its total those who died of respiratory failure directly induced by the virus.The World Health Organisation criticised the definition, describing it as ""too narrow"".Beijing has always contended that its figures are accurate, calling on the WHO to ""uphold a scientific, objective and just position"". Officials said that the peak of patients hospitalised with severe Covid was in early January, although the number subsequently remained high. They said that they would continue to monitor the situation in rural areas, focusing on early detection and prioritising treatment of the most vulnerable.

Ukraine war: China's claim to neutrality fades with Moscow visit - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Reuters Image caption, Russia´s leader and China´s foreign minister in talksBy Stephen McDonellChina correspondent Vladimir Putin loves a really long table. Images of his meetings are famous, with the Russian leader at one end and the person he is speaking to so far away that you wonder if it is hard for them to hear one another.It was not like that when he met China´s top foreign policy official, Wang Yi.There they were, sitting within handshake distance, with an oval-shaped table in the middle.It could be that the proximity was achieved by seating placement at a previously used table, with the Chinese delegation directly across the middle rather than at the long ends but the effect was the same. When the footage was released, it appeared to be a deliberately symbolic move to show that he felt safe enough to be that close to the representative of such an important friend.Of course, it has not always been that way. Decades ago, Beijing´s network of underground fallout shelters was designed to protect the citizens of the Chinese capital from a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.Yet now Xi Jinping´s administration sees Russia as a front-line enemy of US influence. A nation which - like North Korea - may be considered an international pariah but which serves a useful geopolitical purpose.The Chinese government did not even seem that embarrassed when President Putin returned home from attending Beijing Winter Olympics, having proclaimed a new ""no limits"" relationship with China and, within weeks, launched the invasion of Ukraine.Many have asked whether Mr Xi was warned about the imminent war when he sat next to his Russian counterpart who must have been considering barely anything else at the time.China is walking along a very delicate path in its dealings with Russia over Ukraine. Mr Xi may feel like he is confidently striding down the track, but some think that the path is crumbling at the edges, with Beijing´s claim to neutrality increasingly difficult to stand up.Wang Yi comes out of meetings proclaiming that China and Russia are together promoting ""peace and stability"".In other parts of the world, it will seem ludicrous to use expressions like ""peace and stability"" on a trip to Russia just before the first anniversary of that country´s invasion of Ukraine.Beijing knows this and yet decided to press ahead nevertheless, in the full knowledge that it will take a hit reputationally because it has calculated that it is more important to offer significant moral support to Vladimir Putin at this time.When Wang Yi met Sergei Lavrov he said, ""I am ready to exchange views with you my dear friend, on issues of mutual interest and I look forward to reaching new agreements.""Russia´s foreign minister said the two were showing solidarity and defending each other´s interests despite ""high turbulence on the world stage"", as if this turbulence was something floating in the ether rather than chaos of his own government´s making.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Putin and Biden´s speeches compared in under a minuteEarlier this week in Beijing, China´s Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that the conflict in Ukraine could spiral out of control if certain countries kept pouring fuel on the fire.He was referring to the US, a country which is openly giving military assistance to the Ukrainian army but which has warned China not to provide Russia with weapons and ammunition.Analysts are now asking what options China might consider if it looks like President Putin is facing a humiliating battlefield defeat.Researchers in America say that Beijing is already supplying Russia with dual-use equipment, technology which can appear to be civilian but which can also, for example, be used to repair fighter jets.It has also not tried to hide the fact that it is buying up Russian oil and gas to make up for markets its neighbour lost because of sanctions which followed the invasion.What support is China giving Russia? Why so many Russians turn a blind eye to warAnd Vladimir Putin confirmed in his meeting with Wang Yi that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would soon travel to Moscow. It is thought this might happen in the coming months.In a way, the Kremlin is doing China´s dirty work. It is draining Western military resources and putting pressure on Nato and if Russia´s economy tanks because of it, does that really matter to Beijing? It will just need more Chinese products for the recovery afterwards.The problem is that Western countries have been quite united, Russia does not appear able to win and, increasingly, China is being seen standing side by side with a bully who forced a bloody, prolonged war on Europe.China has to be careful not to bite off more than it can handle, but the rest of the world also will not want Asia´s giant dragged into this war to a greater extent than it already is.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingChinaRussiaVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64735707,22,02,2023,bbc,china
China Covid: How many cases and deaths are there? - BBC News,"Related TopicsReality CheckImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There have been reports that hospitals in China are being overwhelmedChina has experienced a surge in Covid infections and deaths across the country since a strict zero-Covid policy was lifted in December, but official data on the extent of the pandemic has been very limited.What China saysBetween 8 December and 12 January, China says there were 59,938 Covid-related deaths across the country.This figure, published on 15 January, was the first update to its death toll since lockdown restrictions were lifted last year.It´s a big jump from the 13 deaths recorded in the previous month - in part because deaths from underlying conditions as well as respiratory failure caused by Covid have now been included.China has also only been recording Covid infections at hospitals and fever clinics for those with recognised symptoms. Asymptomatic cases and positive results from home testing kits are not recorded in the data. Image source, ReutersImage caption, People gathered outside a crematorium in BeijingHow reliable is the data?The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked for more ""rapid, regular and reliable"" data on numbers of hospitalisation and deaths.Beijing says it has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law.""Dr Louise Blair, of the UK-based research company Airfinity, says that although the new death toll is higher than earlier, it may still not represent the true number of deaths when you compare China´s figures with those from other countries.""We would expect China to have higher mortality per capita than those countries as they had higher protection from vaccines and in many cases natural immunity than China.""""These numbers imply a much lower number of deaths per capita in China than all other major countries have experienced,"" she adds.Health services under pressureA study by Peking University estimated that as of 11 January, some 64% of the population were reported to be infected with the virus.Reports in late December suggested hospitals were under growing strain from the number of cases, with long queues for clinics and patients on hospital beds in the middle of busy waiting rooms.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Images appear to show overrun hospitals, like this one in the city of Tianjin on 28 DecemberVideos emerged on social media throughout December appearing to show crowded hospitals as well as queues at funeral homes.The BBC´s team in Beijing has also reported on long queues outside health clinics and a high demand for fever remedies at pharmacies.Covid wave batters China´s overstretched hospitalsTemporary health centres have been set up along with intensive care facilities across the country.How has China´s Covid policy changed? There was a sudden lifting of many of China´s Covid restrictions following protests against strict lockdowns across the country in November.Before that, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as its zero-Covid policy. The measures included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of Covid cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.Image source, China News ServiceImage caption, Schools had been closed in ShanghaiLockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished.A negative Covid test is no longer required to enter public transport, restaurants, gyms and other public buildings (with the exception of orphanages and care homes).On 8 January, China fully opened its borders with no travel restrictions or quarantine measures for arrivals.However, several countries including the US and the UK, have imposed Covid testing on visitors from China due to its Covid surge in a move strongly criticised by China.China´s vaccination policyOverall, China says more than 90% of the population has been fully vaccinated. However, around the time its zero-Covid policy was lifted,  less than half of people aged 80 and over had received three doses of vaccine.   The authorities now say they require local health services to ""strengthen immunization of the whole population, particularly the elderly"".There are doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - are effective against Omicron, the most widespread strain.China has refused to use Western vaccines widely.The government has given no official explanation. However, national pride may be a factor according to Dr Yu Jie, Senior Research Fellow on China at the international affairs think tank Chatham House:""I think it´s Xi Jinping really thinking of things in terms of economic self-reliance - that need to have China produce and use its own vaccine, rather than import it from somewhere.""Reporting by Wanyuan Song, Jake Horton and Jeremy Howell.Related TopicsChinaReality CheckCoronavirus pandemicTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Top US diplomat says China balloon over US is 'unacceptable' - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China rowBy Bernd Debusmann Jr & Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, WashingtonSecretary of State Antony Blinken has said China´s decision to fly an apparent spy balloon over the US is ""unacceptable and irresponsible"".The top American diplomat has abruptly cancelled a trip to Beijing, which would have been the first high level US-China meeting there in years.China earlier expressed regret, saying it was a weather airship that had been blown astray into American airspace.The incident comes amid fraying tensions between the US and China.Later on Friday the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America.""We are seeing reports of a balloon transiting Latin America. We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,"" said Pentagon press secretary Brig Gen Patrick Ryder. He provided no further details about the balloon´s location.Mr Blinken described the Chinese balloon over the US as ""a violation of our sovereignty"".""This is an unacceptable as well as an irresponsible action,"" he said. ""It´s even more irresponsible coming on the eve of a long-planned visit.""America´s top diplomat was set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. But on Thursday US defence officials announced they were tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the United States. High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?While the balloon was, the Pentagon said, ""travelling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic"" and did ""not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground"", its presence sparked outrage.On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying that it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.A statement from China´s Foreign Ministry said that it regretted the incident and would work with the US to resolve the issue.However, the state department official said that while the US acknowledged China´s claim about the balloon´s purpose, it stood by the assessment that it was being used for surveillance. Another trip by Mr Blinken to China would be planned ""at the earliest opportunity"", another senior state department official said, adding that Washington planned to maintain ""open lines of communication"" about the incident. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Anthony Blinken was expected in China on 5 and 6 FebruaryThe official added that the state department had informed close US allies about the violation of US airspace.  In a statement, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada - the country´s foreign ministry - said that it had summoned China´s ambassador over the incident and would ""vigorously express"" its position to Chinese officials. A White House spokesperson said that US President Joe Biden agreed with Mr Blinken that it was ""not appropriate"" to go to China at this time. Mr Biden did not take questions about the balloon following remarks about the US economy on Friday morning.

By Friday morning, the balloon was moving east ""over the centre of the continental US"" at an altitude of about 60,000ft (18,200m) according to Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder. Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said on Twitter that the balloon was over the north-eastern part of his state early on Friday afternoon.  Gen Ryder added that US officials are monitoring the object and reviewing ""options"". He said the balloon - which he described as ""manoeuvrable"" - posed no military or physical threat to people on the ground. Although fighter planes were alerted, the US decided not to shoot the object down due to the dangers of falling debris, officials said. The Democratic president´s political opponents demanded tough action against China. Several Republican lawmakers - as well as former President Donald Trump - have urged the US to down the alleged spy craft. ""Shoot down the balloon,"" Mr Trump said in a short message on his Truth Social social media platform. On Twitter, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the balloon incident was ""a destabilizing action that must be addressed"". The Biden administration must now contend with China ""hawks"" on both sides of the political spectrum. Montana Democratic Senator Jon Tester said in a statement that he was ""still waiting on real answers"". Speaking to CBS, a US official described the payload of the balloon - the attached part from which the alleged surveillance is carried out - as being as large as two or three school buses. The balloon itself is significantly larger. Chinese officials have previously publicly expressed interest in the potential military and intelligence-gathering potential of balloons. ""Technological advances have opened a new door for the use of balloons,"" an article in the military-run Liberation Army Daily said last year. In 2022, Taiwan´s defence ministry said it had detected Chinese balloons over its territory.

Balloon saga deflates efforts to mend US-China relations - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Video appears to show China balloon shot downBy Stephen McDonellChina correspondent As the balloon crashed into the sea so did attempts to mend China-US relations.You can track the trajectory of China´s response to its balloon just as the Pentagon was tracking the trajectory of a high-altitude piece of equipment destined to be blown out of the sky.We´re investigating; we regret that it is our weather balloon blown off course; we think US politicians and media are hyping this up; everyone stay calm; the US attack on this airship is a serious violation of international practice.With Antony Blinken - the US´s top diplomat - scheduled to visit China this week, Beijing had initially tried to reassure Washington this had all been an accident. But once it became clear that the secretary of state wasn´t coming, and that the balloon was not coming back either, the gloves were off.It is a long way from where the Chinese government wanted things to be at this moment.The US Secretary of State was supposed to be here building bridges or at least trying to stop those that still exist from being destroyed.US shoots down Chinese ´spy´ balloon over AtlanticWhy use a spy balloon instead of satellites?Was China balloon blown off course?Make no mistake. Chinese President Xi Jinping had great hopes for this visit and was, reportedly, even going to meet Mr Blinken himself.So what balloon-gathered intelligence could be so good that it was worth scuppering this process? The short answer is none. Which is why many analysts think that, even if it was to some extent spying, the deployment of this balloon, in this way, at this time, had to have been an error on the Chinese side. And, if that is the case, somebody is getting hauled over the coals for it, especially given that there are now two of these high-altitude balloons in play, with another floating above Latin America. There has been no word whether it too is supposed to have been blown wildly off course, given its ""limited self-steering capability"".Internationally, many seem to imagine that China´s Communist Party is an all-knowing, locked in, organ of power - something along the lines of a giant, efficient, supercomputer with Xi Jinping toggling the controls.It is a massive, sprawling organisation, that is certain. However, it is also made up of departments and power blocks competing for influence, at times hoarding information and even deliberately not foreshadowing their actions lest a rival gain some unwanted advantage.When a clearly visible, equipment-carrying balloon started floating close to US nuclear missile siloes, the assumption from some had been not only that it was spying but that it must have been sent as a message to the Biden administration.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Antony Blinken was expected in China on 5 and 6 FebruaryBut when you consider the damage it has done in terms of derailing a visit that the Chinese government, right up to the very top, wanted to happen, it is hard to see how this analysis stacks up.We know that the Blinken trip was important here because we saw how Beijing tried to save it using quite conciliatory language.""The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure,"" a foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying.The extent to which it was deployed to study the weather or spy doesn´t really matter in terms of understanding how crushing this incident has been for those on both sides who have been looking for ways to ease US-China tensions.An enormous breakthrough was not expected from Mr Blinken´s meetings in Beijing. The meetings themselves were to be the breakthrough.They would have spoken about moves towards a set of ""guard rails"", means of communication and lines not to cross in an attempt to prevent a drift towards armed conflict.President Xi also wanted it because he´s looking for some big signs back at home that his administration knows what it is doing when it comes to steering China into the future.A sudden and embarrassing retreat from the zero-Covid approach came just months after China´s leader had declared at the Party Congress that there would be no swerving from it.Then the speed of the about-face led to overcrowded hospital emergency rooms, medicine shortages and an unknown Covid death toll.The government now needs to put all this behind it and encourage an image of a China which is turning around economically and opening up again.A high-level US visit would have been quite useful in this regard.Examine the protestations from the major superpowers this week. Washington has said this was a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"" but we all know that it has plenty of its own very sophisticated means of spying on China.Beijing has condemned this US ""attack on a civilian unmanned airship"" but we all know that if a US surveillance balloon flew into Chinese airspace the People´s Liberation Army would have it down in no time.In a way, this means that the outrage from both sides contains a fair bit of theatre. The upside is that, now the balloon is no more, they will be able to move on from it and reschedule a Beijing visit by Mr Blinken at a time when people are asking each other, ""hey do you remember that whole balloon thing?"".Related TopicsXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaCommunist Party of ChinaDiplomacyUnited StatesChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64529922,06,02,2023,bbc,china
China says US balloons breached airspace at least 10 times - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsBy Kelly NgBBC NewsChina´s foreign ministry says the US has flown balloons into its airspace more than 10 times in the past year.It comes after the US on 4 February shot down a suspected spy balloon over its airspace - which China said was one of its weather balloons gone astray.Relations between the two countries have since deteriorated. In recent days, the US has also shot down a number of other unidentified objects.Questioned on Monday, Beijing said the US had made many airspace breaches.""It´s not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a regular press briefing.""Since last year alone, US balloons have illegally flown above China more than 10 times without any approval from Chinese authorities.""""The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,"" he added.He said Beijing had responded to the incursions in a ""responsible and professional"" manner. ""If you want to know more about US high-altitude balloons illegally entering China´s airspace, I suggest you refer to the US side,"" he said.Chinese state-affiliated media reported over the weekend that an unidentified flying object had been spotted off the country´s east coast, with the military preparing to shoot it down.The White House denied Beijing´s accusation that it sent balloons over China to conduct surveillance, with National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson calling the claims ""false"" on Twitter.The first balloon incident led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned trip to Beijing. The top diplomat called China´s alleged high-altitude spying ""unacceptable and irresponsible"".On Sunday, the US ordered an unmanned ""octagonal structure"" to be downed in Michigan near the Canadian border - the fourth object to be taken out in eight days.Fighter pilots also shot down smaller unidentified objects over Alaska on 10 February and northern Canada on 11 February.Mr Wang said he had ""no understanding of [these other objects]"".""But what we want to tell everyone here is that the US´ frequent firing of advanced missiles used to strike down unidentified flying objects is an overreaction of excessive force,"" he said.A US military commander, General Glen VanHerck, said that there was no indication of any threat from the latest object. He said it could be a ""gaseous type of balloon"" or ""some type of a propulsion system"" - adding he could not rule out that the objects were extra-terrestrials.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to keep the country safe from the threat of spy balloons.""We have something called the quick reaction alert force which involves Typhoon planes, which are kept on 24/7 readiness to police our airspace, which is incredibly important,"" he added.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China rowRelated TopicsChinaCommunist Party of ChinaDiplomacyUnited StatesChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64621598,13,02,2023,bbc,china
Newspaper headlines: 'Tests on China arrivals' and 'Queen's honour' - BBC News,"By StaffBBC NewsImage source, ReutersSeveral front pages feature the story that people travelling from China do not have Covid-19 before they can travel to the UK. The Daily Mail says the ""drastic"" step of reimposing controls is over fears Beijing is withholding data on the virus, while the FT Weekend notes that Conservative MPs were calling on the government to act.But in the Daily Telegraph, former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith says the restrictions must not become a ""slippery slope"" to more tests and lockdowns. The Times leads on a warning from Professor Sir Chris Whitty that thousands of middle-aged people are dying of heart conditions because they did not get statins or blood pressure medicines during the pandemic. England´s chief medical officer, is said to have ""raised the alarm"" in government that Britain is now starting to see the after-effects of people staying away from GP surgeries. However, the paper says that ambulance delays could also be to blame for heart attacks and strokes not being treated promptly. ""King knights Queen"" declares The Sun´s headline, as it leads on the guitarist Brian May being given a knighthood in the New Year Honours. Sir Brian is quoted as saying he will use the title to ""fight for justice"". The i Weekend says a row has ""erupted"" over the decision to recognise just four members of the England women´s football team that won the European Championships. Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell says the decision is ""out of sync"" with other sporting victories, but the chairman of the sports honours committee, Sir Hugh Robertson, says the selective approach was to avoid a situation where ""people who´ve done five minutes on the pitch... get an award"".The Daily Express leads on data from the Labour Party that shows more than 700 prisoners have escaped or been released in error from jails during the past decade. In one case, a sex offender raped a 16-year-old girl and sexually assaulted another young woman after being mistakenly released by the prison service. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said releases in error are extremely rare and there have been just 15 prison escapes since 2010, 90% fewer than in the preceding 12 years.A number of papers feature predictions for the new year, with the i Weekend suggesting that ministers are ""gearing up for strikes to dominate the news agenda in the coming months"". The Times says there is ""trouble ahead"" for the prime minister, with inflation, NHS waiting lists and immigration the biggest issues he needs to tackle. The Daily Mirror suggests we could see another summer of heatwaves. In an unconventional avian and celebrity crossover story, ""Russell Crowe saves a crow called Russell"" headlines The Sun, as it reports on a fundraising effort to help a bird in need. The owners of the feathered version of Crowe needed £1,500 for an operation because of a serious eye infection. The target was beaten, in part because of £500 pounds donated online by the Hollywood superstar. The paper has confirmed Russell´s surgery has gone well, calling it a story with a ""flappy ending"".

China Square: The cheap Chinese shop at the centre of Kenya row - BBC News,"Image source, EPAImage caption, Protesters wanted China Square to permanently shut its doorsBy Victor KipropBBC News, NairobiA Chinese-owned shop selling cheap household goods at the centre of a dispute in Kenya has reopened after a counterfeit complaint against it was dismissed. The row got to the heart of a debate about whether this kind of outlet hurts or helps Kenyans.Blowing whistles and vuvuzelas, Kenyan petty traders marched in their hundreds to the deputy president´s office in Nairobi to demand an end to what they called a ""China invasion"".The China Square shop that had become a hit with consumers because of its cheap goods was the focus of their anger. Its rapid success had rekindled long-held fears about competition from abroad.The shop, which is in a mall on the outskirts of Nairobi, had already shut its doors, albeit temporarily, by the time of last week´s protest as controversy swirled around it.Barely five weeks into trading, it had become a social media phenomenon. Its low prices compared to what the petty traders were charging and convenient location made it very attractive.But some small-scale traders, who form a vital part of Kenya´s economy, began to notice business dropping off.""We want the Chinese out of Kenya. If the Chinese become the manufacturers, distributors, retailers and even hawkers, where will Kenyans go?"" an unnamed trader told journalists at the protest.Peter Sitati, who imports and sells beauty equipment in Nairobi, was one of those at the demonstration.He says a plastic pedicure stool that costs around $43 (£35) in his shop, retailed at China Square for about $21, effectively undercutting him by more than 50%.""Many Kenyan businesses are going to close their shops and our economy will collapse,"" Mr Sitati argued.Image source, Peter SitatiImage caption, Peter Sitati says he is not able to sell his goods at China Square´s lower pricesPressed to explain why he was charging so much more, he said he was covering the taxes and duty he was charged and thought that he might be buying the goods from China at a higher price than China Square.Despite being asked by the BBC, China Square did not explain how it set its prices, but it might be benefitting from being able to buy in bigger quantities. It may also have a more direct relationship with the manufacturers. A lot of the smaller Kenyan traders have to go through middle men and may be charged more as a result.China Square founder Lei Cheng insisted he had done nothing wrong.""My business is legal and is centred on healthy competition. We have cooperated with all government directives of opening a business in Kenya and we are here to break the monopoly,"" Mr Lei said.He added that his business took more than $157,000 in its first two weeks.""The people who are fighting us feel threatened because Kenyans now know we exist and we are not exploiting them in pricing.""´Quality goods, affordable prices´Some Kenyan shoppers are on the retailer´s side.""China Square should be allowed to operate. They´re selling quality goods at affordable prices,"" Sharon Wanjiku said.""The cost of living is very high at the moment and these prices are exactly what we need.""The swift popularity of the shop followed by the controversy caught the attention of the government, with one minister saying it should cease operating as a retailer.""We welcome Chinese investors to Kenya but as manufacturers not traders,"" Trade Minister Moses Kuria said on Twitter on the Friday before China Square shut down.It remains unclear why the shop did close its doors to customers. There were suspicions that it had been put under some pressure by the authorities.A statement from China Square said it was closing to ""re-evaluate and replan our company strategy"" and that it was ""considering a possibility of co-operating with local traders"".But at the end of last week, Kenya´s Anti-Counterfeit Authority said it had investigated a complaint that China Square was selling fake goods but had found no evidence that that was the case.On Monday, the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce (KCCC) welcomed the re-opening of China Square after discussions were held with the government, however it did not go into details of what the talks were about.""The Chamber looks forward to an equal and fair treatment of all businesses across [the] board to ensure a conducive business environment for all,"" the KCCC statement said, but it did not say if any new agreement had been made.Image source, EPAImage caption, The protest against China Square attracted a large crowdSome fear that the row over the shop has sent out the wrong message about the economy and the interest in investment.Korir SingOei, from the ministry of foreign affairs, has been seeking to reassure potential investors, saying that Kenya welcomes money from outside and does not discriminate where it comes from.Wu Peng, the top diplomat for Africa at China´s Foreign Ministry, was pleased with the clarification and said a ""non-discriminatory investment environment is vital to the healthy development of bilateral practical co-operation"".Kenya has in the past struggled to find a middle ground between attracting foreign investment and promoting free trade while protecting local traders from what some see as unfair competition.""Stopping foreigners from doing legitimate business in Kenya is retrogressive. We need to see how to build the capacity of Kenyans to be able to produce competitive products,"" says Kenyan economist Gerrishon Ikiara. DeportationsThe Kenya Investment Promotion Act, which sets conditions for foreign investors, requires an investment to be beneficial to the country through things such as new jobs, the transfer of new skills or technology, or the use of local raw materials or services.There is no data available to show how many Chinese traders or people are in Kenya, but there has been growing anti-Chinese sentiment in recent years. This has been partly due to allegations that individual Chinese people in Kenya have been racist, as well as fears of Chinese traders taking businesses and jobs from Kenyans.In 2019, the Kenyan authorities deported seven Chinese nationals who had been operating in two markets in Nairobi, accusing them of not having work permits and saying they could not operate in a sector that had been reserved for locals.In 2020, four Chinese men were deported after being accused of caning a Kenyan man working at a Chinese restaurant. President William Ruto has so far steered clear of the matter, but ahead of his election last year he promised to deport Chinese nationals engaging in business that can be done by Kenyans.""We have agreements with different countries on what level of business or work is to be done by locals and which one is allowed, where one must have [a] work permit, to foreigners. And that level is not selling in kiosks, retail or roasting maize,"" Mr Ruto said last June.China Square is clearly not working out of a kiosk, but its re-opening continues to present a challenge to the petty traders, whose complaints have not gone away.Related TopicsAfrica–China relationsKenya",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64809423,06,03,2023,bbc,china
China Covid: US considers restrictions on Chinese arrivals - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, EPABy Sam HancockBBC NewsThe US is considering imposing new Covid restrictions on Chinese arrivals, after Beijing announced it would reopen its borders next month. American officials say this is due to a lack of transparency surrounding the virus in China, as cases surge.On Wednesday, Italy announced plans to enforce mandatory testing, after tighter measures were outlined by Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and India.Beijing said coronavirus rules should be brought in on a ""scientific"" basis. Officials in the Italian city of Milan are already testing passengers on flights from China.On one flight, which landed at the city´s Malpensa Airport on Boxing Day, 52% of passengers were found to be positive for Covid, la Repubblica reports.Officials are yet to comment on these figures but, in a statement, Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said he had ordered mandatory Covid-19 testing for all passengers coming from China and transiting through Italy.He said this was ""essential to ensure the surveillance and identification"" of any new variants of the virus, and to ""protect the Italian population"".Italy was ravaged by Covid during the first outbreak in 2020, with the northern region of Lombardy - near Malpensa Airport - at one point becoming the global epicentre of the virus after it spread from China. An EU Foreign Affairs spokeswoman said while member states had agreed to remove Covid travel restrictions earlier this year, there was an understanding that, if necessary, they could be reintroduced in a coordinated manner.She also said that the BF7 omicron variant - prevalent in China - was already present in Europe and had failed to become dominant. Passport applications for Chinese citizens wishing to travel internationally will resume from 8 January, the country´s immigration authorities have said.Travel sites have reported a spike in traffic, leaving some countries fearful over the potential spread of Covid. ""There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing Covid-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data,"" US officials said in a statement quoted by news agencies.China to begin reopening to the world in JanuaryChinese rush to book travel as Covid rules lifted Wang Wenbin, China´s foreign minister spokesperson, subsequently accused Western countries and media of ""hyping up"" and ""distorting China´s Covid policy adjustments"". He said China believed all countries´ Covid responses should be ""science-based and proportionate"", and should ""not affect normal people-to-people exchange"".Mr Wang called for ""joint efforts to ensure safe cross-border travel, maintain stability of global industrial supply chains and promote economic recovery and growth"".The UK and Germany each said they are monitoring the situation closely, but are not currently considering new restrictions for Chinese travellers. A Downing Street spokesperson said the number of cases in Britain was still ""relatively low"". Meanwhile, a German health ministry official said there was ""no indication that a more dangerous mutation [of Covid] had developed"".The true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown because officials have stopped releasing the necessary data. Reports say hospitals are overwhelmed and elderly people are dying.Last week, Beijing reported about 4,000 new Covid infections each day and few deaths.Before the relaxation of travel rules, people were strongly discouraged from travelling abroad. The sale of outbound group and package travel was banned, according to marketing solutions company Dragon Trail International.Within half an hour of Monday´s notice that China´s borders would reopen, data from travel site Trip.com - cited in Chinese media - showed searches for popular destinations had increased ten-fold on last year.Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and South Korea were the most popular destinations.Separately on Wednesday, Hong Kong´s leader John Lee announced that his city was scrapping the last of its Covid rules almost immediately - apart from the wearing of face masks, which will remain compulsory.""The city has reached a relatively high vaccination rate which builds an anti-epidemic barrier,"" Mr Lee told a media briefing.The US still requires international travellers to show proof of being fully vaccinated against Covid on entering the country. The website for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends that anyone travelling to the US gets a Covid test beforehand and has their result to hand - but this is not a legal obligation.In their statement, the unnamed US officials added they were ""following the science and advice of public health experts"" and ""consulting with partners"".China´s loosening of travel measures - the last part of the country´s controversial zero-Covid policy - follows weeks of unrest which saw people take to the streets in rare protests against President Xi Jinping and his government.

China media guide - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesChina is the largest media market in the world, and has the world´s largest online population. Outlets operate under tight Communist Party control. The opening-up of the industry has extended to distribution and advertising, not to editorial content. However, there is leeway for independent coverage that is not perceived as a threat to social stability or the Party.Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has described President Xi Jinping as the ""planet´s leading censor and press freedom predator"". It says government policies are aimed at achieving ""complete hegemony over news coverage and the creation of an international media order heavily influenced by China"".  Beijing tries to limit access to foreign news by restricting rebroadcasting and the use of satellite receivers, by jamming shortwave broadcasts, including those of the BBC, and by blocking websites. Overseas Chinese-language news outlets that are not state-owned are blocked in mainland China. However, international English language websites like the BBC are often available to view. But content that is contrary to Communist Party rhetoric is filtered and English-language news sites can be filtered at times of tension. Fears that the media in Hong Kong would lose their independence when the territory reverted to Chinese control in 1997 have generally not been borne out. Hong Kong still has editorially-dynamic media, but worries about interference remain.TV is available in most homes and the sector is competitive, especially in cities. There are more than 3,300 local, regional and national TV channels.State-run Chinese Central TV (CCTV) is China´s largest media company. Its dominance is challenged by provincial TVs, which are on the air nationally via satellite. China is a major market for pay TV, which is almost entirely delivered by cable. All of China´s 2,600-plus radio stations are state-owned.There are around 1,900 newspapers. Each city has its own title, usually published by the local government, as well as a local Communist Party daily. China spends hugely on TV, radio, online and press outlets targeted at international audiences, aiming to extend its political influence and boost its image. It is less keen to allow foreign players into the domestic market. Phenomenal online growthChina has the world´s largest internet-using population. There were 1.01 billion internet users by July 2022, comprising 69% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com).Around 26.7 per cent of the online population live in rural areas. The China Internet Network Information Centre (CNNIC) says 98.6% of China´s online population can access the internet via a smartphone. There are three powerful online giants, known collectively as ""BAT"": Baidu is the top search engine; e-commerce leader Alibaba has allied with Sina, which operates the Weibo microblog platform; and Tencent owns instant messenger WeChat.Because of official censorship, Weibo is losing some of its appeal as a forum where relatively uncensored news can be shared. WeChat, Tencent´s take on the WhatsApp instant messenger, has the largest number of domestic users of any social media service in China.China has the world´s largest online video market. Streaming platforms, including market leader iQiyi, Youku Tudou and Sohu have a huge following and pose a challenge to traditional TV.An extensive web filtering system, dubbed the ""Great Firewall of China"", blocks tens of thousands of sites using URL filtering and keyword censoring.Thousands of cyber-police watch the web and material deemed politically and socially sensitive is filtered. Blocked resources include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and human rights sites.The use of circumvention tools, including virtual private networks (VPNs), became harder after China strengthened its firewall to allow it to intercept data traffic to and from individual IP addresses. This was coined the ""Great Fire Cannon"" when it came into effect in 2015. The government since has signalled that it will ban unapproved VPNs.Media guides by BBC MonitoringPressPeople´s Daily (Renmin Ribao) - Communist Party daily, web pages in EnglishChina Youth Daily (Zhongguo Qingnian Bao) - state-run, linked to Communist Youth LeagueChina Daily - official English-language paperGlobal Times (Huanqiu Shibao) - state-run, editions in English and Chinese, focuses on world affairsPeople´s Liberation Army Daily (Jiefangjun Bao) - web pages in EnglishReference News (Cankao Xiaoxi) - published by official news agency Xinhua21st Century (21 Jingji) - leading business newspaper, privately-ownedTelevisionChinese Central TV (CCTV) - state-run national broadcaster; 18 free-to-air networksChina Global TV Network (CGTN) - state-run international broadcaster; networks in English, Arabic, French, Russian, SpanishRadioChina National Radio - state-runChina Radio International - state-run external broadcaster, programmes in more than 40 languages, notably to Taiwan and KoreaNews agencyXinhua (New China News Agency) - state-run, web pages in EnglishChina News Service (CNS) - state-run, web pages in English Related TopicsMediaAsiaChinaAsia PacificTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished28 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Scores missing after large mine collapse in China - BBC News,"Image source, CCTVImage caption, State media footage of the coal mine´s collapse in Alxa League, Inner MongoliaBy Nicholas Yong and Fiona NimoniBBC NewsAt least four people have died and 49 more are missing after a mine collapsed in China´s northern Inner Mongolia region on Wednesday.Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered a search and rescue operation which has so far found six survivors in the open-pit mine at Alxa League.But desperate efforts to retrieve others were temporarily disrupted by two landslides.It is not yet clear what caused the slope at the mine to give way.More than 900 rescue workers had been deployed to the scene, Xinhua news agency reported.Mr Xi has instructed authorities to make ""every possible effort"" to find survivors.China orders coal miners to boost output: reportsHow China shapes the world´s coal - BBC FutureWei Zhiguo, leader of the rescue mission, said the operation had been interrupted by a ""large landslide"" on Wednesday evening. This had halted some search efforts overnight, which were also hampered by a second landslide later in the day. ""The rescue work is being carried out in an orderly and tense manner,"" he told state broadcaster CCTV.Police told CCTV that an investigation was underway, and that the relevant persons have been ""controlled"".The mine collapsed around 13:00 local time (0500 GMT) on Wednesday, burying more than 50 workers. It affected a ""wide area"", authorities said.The collapse left a pile of debris roughly 500m (1,640ft) across and an estimated 80m high.CCTV reported the shaft had been operated by the Xinjing Coal Mining Company, which has not issued a statement yet.Mines in China´s Inner Mongolia region are some of China´s top coal producers. Chinese mines have also been trying to boost output over the past year in a bid to boost supplies and lower prices. Accidents are not uncommon in China, where industrial safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December 2020, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. And in January 2021, 10 miners were killed in a blast at a gold mine in Shandong province.Related TopicsChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64730607,23,02,2023,bbc,china
China and Belarus express 'extreme interest' in Ukraine peace - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Alexander Lukashenko, left, met Xi Jinping on WednesdayBy Tessa Wong & George WrightBBC NewsThe leaders of China and Belarus have expressed their ""extreme interest"" in a peaceful resolution in Ukraine.Chinese President and Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia´s Vladimir Putin, issued the statement after talks in Beijing.Mr Lukashenko said his country ""fully supports"" a Beijing plan for ending the war in Ukraine.China announced a plan for peace talks last week, calling for the respect of national sovereignty.The visit comes days after China sent its top diplomat Wang Yi to meet Mr Putin. Mr Lukashenko and Mr Xi´s meeting also coincided with a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Central Asian nations to discuss the Ukraine war.On Wednesday, China and Belarus ""expressed deep concern"" about the conflict and ""extreme interest in the soonest possible establishment of peace in Ukraine"", the Belarus state-run news agency Belta reported.Mr Lukashenko has aided the Russian leader in his war in Ukraine, and observers have seen his trip to Beijing as another sign of China closing ranks with Russia and its allies.The Belarus leader praised China´s peace plan.The 12-point document urges respect for ""the sovereignty of all countries"". It does not specifically say Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine and condemns the usage of ""unilateral sanctions"", an implicit criticism of Ukraine´s Western allies.Mr Lukashenko said he ""fully supports the initiative on international security you have put forward"", according to remarks released by his aides.Political decisions ""should be aimed at first and foremost preventing a slide into a global confrontation that will see no winners"", he told Mr Xi.China´s peace plan was met with general distrust in the West.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he agreed with some parts of it and said it was a sign of China´s willingness to engage. Beijing has so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky´s call for a summit. Zelensky wants to meet China´s Xi to discuss peace planThe Chinese leader called for discarding ""all Cold War mentality"", according to a Chinese readout of the meeting with Mr Lukashenko.Mr Xi added that countries ""should stop politicising"" the world economy and to ""do things that will aid a ceasefire, cessation of war, and a peaceful resolution"".Mr Lukashenko´s three-day visit comes after China upgraded the status of its relationship with Belarus in September, several months into the Ukraine war.Chinese foreign ministry statements have described their ties as an ""all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership"", a rare term that has been used for only one other country - Pakistan.This means Belarus ranks very highly in China´s hierarchy of international relationships, just below Russia, according to a BBC Monitoring analysis. Belarus has been a key ally for Russia from the very beginning of the conflict when it allowed Moscow to use the Belarusian border with Ukraine as a launchpad for an attack on Kyiv, which eventually failed.China, meanwhile, has attempted to appear neutral by stating support for both sovereignty and the right to national security, which are Ukraine and Russia´s respective interests.But Beijing has also refused to condemn Moscow and supported their war effort in indirect ways. Chinese state media has actively propagated Russian´s view on the war, according to multiple analyses. The Chinese government strongly rejected claims made by the United States last week that it was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia. ""We do not accept the United States´ finger-pointing on China-Russia relations, let alone coercion and pressure,"" China´s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said when asked about the allegations.Chinese firms are also accused of supplying dual-use technology - goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as drones and semi-conductor chips - to Russia.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsWednesday´s visit took place as the US made its own diplomatic push, with Mr Blinken touring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

Countries across Central Asia understand this,"" he said.All five Central Asian countries are former members of the Soviet Union who have trade ties with Russia and China.

US-China chip war: Netherlands moves to restrict some tech exports - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Annabelle  LiangBusiness reporterThe Dutch government is to put restrictions on the country´s ""most advanced"" microchip technology exports to protect national security, following a similar move by the US.It will include products by chip equipment maker ASML, a key firm in the global microchip supply chain.In response, China has launched a formal complaint against the move.It said it hoped the Netherlands would not ""follow the abuse of export control measures by certain countries"".China has frequently called the US a ""tech hegemony"" in response to export controls imposed by Washington.Semiconductors, which power everything from mobile phones to military hardware, are at the centre of a bitter dispute between the US and China.A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mao Ning, said the Dutch move aimed to deprive China of its right to develop.Dexter Roberts, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank, told the BBC that the decision by the Netherlands was ""a real step forward, a real victory for the US and also very bad news for China"".""US-China relations are already in a pretty bad place. This clearly will make things even worse.""The measures will affect ""very specific technologies in the semiconductor production cycle,"" the Dutch trade minister Liesje Schreinemacher said.""The Netherlands considers it necessary on national and international security grounds that this technology is brought under control as soon as possible,"" she said in a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday.Ms Schreinemacher added that the Dutch government had considered ""the technological developments and geopolitical context,"" without naming China or ASML.Under the new rules, companies would have to apply for licences to export technology including ""the most advanced Deep Ultra Violet (DUV) immersion lithography and deposition"".ASML said in a statement that it expects the restrictions to apply to its ""most advanced immersion DUV systems"".The company added that ""based on today´s announcement, our expectation of the Dutch government´s licensing policy, and the current market situation, we do not expect these measures to have a material effect on our financial outlook.""Lithography machines use lasers to print miniscule patterns on silicon as part of the manufacturing process of microchips.Since 2019 the Dutch government has stopped ASML from selling its most advanced lithography machines to China.In October, Washington announced that it would require licences for companies exporting chips to China using US tools or software, no matter where they are made in the world.The US has been pushing the Netherlands and Japan to adopt similar restrictions.Meanwhile, South Korea´s trade ministry raised concerns over the US policy on semiconductors earlier this week.""The South Korean government will make it clear that the conditions of the Chips Act could deepen business uncertainties, violate companies´ management and technology rights as well as make the United States less attractive as an investment option,"" the ministry said.South Korea is home to major microprocessor manufacturers including the world´s biggest memory chip maker Samsung.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: How the semiconductor shortage could be a problem for youRelated TopicsCompaniesNetherlandsSemiconductorsChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64897794,09,03,2023,bbc,china
Taiwan ally Honduras seeks diplomatic switch to China - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Honduras wants to establish an official relationship with ChinaBy Joel GuintoBBC NewsTaiwan is in danger of losing one of its few formal allies, Honduras, as the Central American nation seeks official relations with China.Honduran President Xiomara Castro said the pivot aims to expand foreign engagements.Taiwan promptly cautioned Honduras against falling into China´s ""trap"".China has long tried to isolate Taiwan and prohibits its partners from keeping ties with the island which it considers part of its territory.Should Honduras switch sides to China, Taiwan would be recognised by just 13 governments.It will also widen Beijing´s foothold in a region that has historically sided with its rival Washington.On Wednesday, China´s foreign ministry welcomed the Honduras leader´s statement and said it was willing to develop ""friendly and cooperative relations"" with the country.China has sought to expand its influence around the world as its leader, Xi Jinping, consolidates power back home while reviving the economy from the bruising zero-Covid policy.Taiwan has lost eight diplomatic allies since 2016, when Tsai Ing-wen was elected as president. Ms Castro, who assumed office in 2021, said she had instructed her foreign minister to pursue official relations with China, fulfilling one of her campaign pledges. The Honduran president did not specifically say if relations with Taiwan would be cut. However in January 2022, she said she hoped to keep those ties.Weeks before Ms Castro´s announcement, her government said it was negotiating with China to build a hydroelectric dam. Beijing had lent Honduras $300m (£246m) for a similar project in 2021.""We ask Honduras to carefully consider and do not fall into China´s trap and make the wrong decision to damage the long-term friendship between Taiwan and Honduras,"" the island´s foreign ministry said in a statement.Ms Castro´s move also comes ahead of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen´s planned trip to its Central American allies with a stopover in the US next month - a move that will likely increase friction between Washington and Beijing.Ms Tsai´s visit will include a meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. She had met Mr McCarthy´s predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, in Taipei last year to Beijing´s fury.As China charms Latin America, it has continued to assert itself on the other side of the world. The outgoing president of the Pacific island nation of Micronesia, David Panuelo, accused China of spying and attempting to bribe local politicians to bring his country to Beijing´s side. Mr Panuelo´s claims were contained in a letter to congress last week.Related TopicsAsiaChinaTaiwanHondurasChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64960744,15,03,2023,bbc,china
Covid-19: PM Modi cautions India amid China coronavirus surge - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Indian government has asked people to return to Covid-appropriate behaviourIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to start wearing masks again as the country steps up surveillance of Covid cases.Mr Modi held a review meeting on Thursday amid a surge in cases in China which has put India on alert.The prime minister called for increased testing and encouraged a return to Covid-appropriate behaviour. India had relaxed its Covid rules, including mask-wearing, earlier this year after a drop in infection levels.The country witnessed two deadly waves in 2020 and 2022 - and the government had come under heavy criticism for its handling of the second wave in the summer of 2021 when thousands died amid a lack of oxygen supplies and critical medicines.At Thursday´s meeting, Mr Modi asked states to ensure operational readiness of hospital infrastructure, including a healthy supply of oxygen cylinders and ventilators.While there was no reason to panic, the prime minister cautioned against complacency and urged citizens to take all necessary precautions. According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases, but reports of the surge in China have created a sense of fear among many people. Over the past few months, India has reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7, the Omicron subvariant linked to a spike in cases in China. The cases - three in Gujarat state and one in Odisha - were detected in July, September and November and the patients have recovered, health officials have said.Several experts have said that India does not have reason to panic.In Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has assured the people that no case of the Covid variant has been detected in national capital.In the southern state of Karnataka, the government has made Covid tests mandatory for flu-like symptoms and said masks may soon be mandatory in closed spaces.Top health officials have asked people to get vaccinated and take booster doses. Over 2.2 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country, but only 27% of the population have taken the booster dose - which India calls a ""precaution dose"" - so far. The government said it had no plans yet to stop flights from countries where new cases were reported. But the country has resumed random testing of international travellers at the airports.On Thursday, India´s health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in parliament that though cases in China were rising, those in India were ""depleting"". He added that the ministry was closely monitoring new variants and advised states to increase genome sequencing.On Twitter, the government also debunked a fake message circulating on WhatsApp regarding a subvariant of the Omicron strain.Skip twitter post by Ministry of Health#FakeNewsThis message is circulating in some Whatsapp groups regarding XBB variant of #COVID19.The message is #FAKE and #MISLEADING. pic.twitter.com/LAgnaZjCCi— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) December 22, 2022

Spy balloon row: High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China ties - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden smiled for the cameras at the G20 summit in NovemberBy Barbara Plett UsherBBC State Department correspondentEven before America´s top diplomat Anthony Blinken postponed his visit to Beijing, the US-China relationship was at an all-time low.Just how low became painfully evident when a day before his departure, an apparent Chinese spy balloon over the state of Montana roiled the tensions he was trying to address.Eventually, the Chinese foreign ministry claimed the unmanned airship was used for weather research and had blown off course.  The accompanying expression of regret suggested Beijing did not want the incident to mar the secretary of state´s visit - the first of its kind in five years.  But the damage was done.Hours after China´s apology, the US State Department called off the trip.Given how wide the rift has become, the fact that the trip was happening in the first place had been cause for celebration.But now what remains is a sense of huge missed opportunity. All along, US officials had made clear that this was not about breakthroughs. It was about talking.Mr Blinken wants to ""avoid competition veering into conflict"".  ""One of the ways you do that is making sure that you actually have good lines of communication,"" he said in a speech last month, calling for ""putting some guardrails into the relationship.""  That means restoring regular contacts and establishing working norms.   ""I think the goal [was] to basically fast-forward this Cold War to its détente phase, thereby skipping a Cuban Missile Crisis,"" says Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.  US halts Blinken China visit after spy balloon rowWhy use a spy balloon instead of satellites?It hasn´t been an easy ride for the world´s two biggest economies.A Trump-era trade war, tensions over Taiwan and an increasingly assertive China under Xi Jinping derailed the relationship in recent years. And it plummeted further as China refused to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Then came a meeting between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in November.The two leaders expressed the desire to avoid conflict and reduced the heat of their rhetoric.  And Mr Blinken wanted to build on that. Even before the balloon went up, the shift was one of tone, more than substance.The Americans have continued to press ahead with the economic restrictions and military expansion in the region, angering Beijing.In the past week, Japan and the Netherlands were reported to have reached an agreement with Washington to restrict exports of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to China.This would be only the latest step by the US to limit Beijing´s access to sensitive semiconductor technology, cutting it out of microchip supply chains.  ""This shows the US has taken a much harder line on tech transfer, trying to get key allies on board,"" says Chris Miller, a professor of international history who wrote a book about US-China tensions over chip technology.And in the past few days, the US military announced it was expanding its presence in the Philippines - one of several moves to strengthen regional alliances as it positions itself to counter China amid growing concern over a possible conflict with Taiwan.  But the Biden administration still wanted to talk.   Mr Blanchett said the White House thought this was a good time to do so, because it had won some breathing room with a Congress hawkish on China by establishing a track record of being tough on Beijing, moving beyond steps taken by former President Donald Trump.   Instead, the balloon gave Republicans an opening to lead the charge in demanding action against China´s ""brazen disregard for US sovereignty"".State department officials emphasised they had not given up, that the diplomatic contacts continued to set up another meeting. But they gave no date, adding to the sense of a consequential relationship in limbo.Additional reporting by Tessa WongRelated TopicsAntony BlinkenChinaUnited StatesChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64519356,03,02,2023,bbc,china
Is India-China race to build damaging the Himalayas? - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Widening of roads in northern India have caused significant increase in landslides and rock-fallsBy Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World ServiceWith fresh cracks appearing on the ground, the Himalayan town of Joshimath in northern India continues to make headlines. Why the town is sinking remains a subject of debate. But scientists say there is a bigger disturbing picture unfolding in the Himalayas. They say the pace at which China and India are building infrastructure across the Himalayan region can significantly increase hazards and risks of natural disasters. Global warming is further destabilising the ecologically fragile region as rising temperatures continue to melt glaciers and permafrost (permanently frozen land).The trauma of living in India´s sinking Himalayan townAnd this is where highways are being carved, railway tracks are being laid, tunnels are being drilled, dams and airstrips are being built on both the sides of the Himalayas. ""So, basically you are bringing yourself closer and closer to the hazards"" said Andreas Kaab, professor of physical geography and hydrology at Oslo University, who co-authored a major report on the cause of a devastating avalanche in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand state in 2021.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hydropower plants in narrow Himalayan valleys can end up damaging the projectsStudies have focused on individual events but when they are pieced together, they show increasing risks of hazards across the region - 3,500km (2,174 miles) of which China and India share as their de facto border, called the Line of Actual Control (LAC).There was one partial or fully road-blocking landslide on every kilometre along the NH-7 national highway in Uttarakhand during September and October 2022, a study published in the Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences said. Other studies have also pointed at similar hazards. What’s the future of India´s sinking Himalayan town?""In addition to the environmental conditions, road construction and widening have contributed to the formation of new landslides which are often shallow and small, but which nevertheless inflict fatalities, [cause] severe damages to infrastructure and traffic disruption,"" a study published by European Geosciences Union said.Landslides and other natural disasters have increasingly become common in recent years. The newly built Char Dham highway in Uttarakhand has also seen parts of it collapse during the monsoon rains last year.More than 200 people were killed and two under-construction hydropower stations were severely damaged during the Chamoli avalanche. While preparing a report on the incident, India´s National Disaster Management Authority found that officials in the district had not factored in climate and infrastructure related risks while making plans to deal with future disasters.  Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eastern Tibet has experienced high-magnitude ice-rock avalanches in recent decadesIndia´s ministry of environment, forests and climate change did not respond to our questions about infrastructure projects posing threats to the Himalayan region. Experts say the risk of natural disasters is equally high on the Chinese side of the Himalayas. Thawing of permafrost is posing immense threat to the infrastructure built in the region.A study published in Communications Earth and Environment journal in October found that nearly 9,400km of road, 580km of railways, more than 2,600km of power lines and thousands of buildings in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau are in permafrost area.Did nuclear spy devices in the Himalayas trigger India floods?""By 2050, 38.14% of roads, 38.76% of railways, 39.41% of power lines and 20.94% of buildings may be threatened by permafrost degradation in high-hazard areas,"" it said. In eastern Tibet, to the north of India´s Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim states, the terrain becomes difficult. The risk of rivers bursting out from their natural path remains high. Image source, Wang HEImage caption, Earthquakes are common in the Himalayas""The region has experienced a series of high-magnitude ice-rock avalanches, glacier detachments and glacial lake outburst floods in recent decades,"" a report published last year in The Cryosphere journal said.Earlier this month, 28 people died after a massive avalanche hit the exit of a tunnel in the Medog county in Tibet.In 2000, a huge landslide destroyed all bridges, roads and telecommunications facilities built over the previous decades in Bomi country in the same part of Tibet.""The region is the focus of considerable investment by the Chinese government, including construction of the high-speed Sichuan-Tibet railway,"" said the report published in The Cryosphere.In pictures: One year after India floodsChinese officials say the railway will go over 21 snow-capped mountains more than 4,000m (13,000ft)  above sea level) and cross 14 major rivers.""In addition to the rugged terrain, the railway will face other hazards such as avalanches, landslides and earthquakes,"" You Yong, chief engineer of the institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua News Agency. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Experts say most infrastructure projects are implemented without proper environment impact assessmentsExperts say increasing settlements in places like Nyingchi and Shigatse have also meant significant increase in development of infrastructure, including roads and telecommunications.""They have built 624 new border settlements,"" says Robbie Barnett, professorial research associate with School of Oriental and African Studies in London, citing Chinese media reports. ""Each of these has to have extensive infrastructural components including roads, power supplies, water supplies and so forth.""Many are at extraordinarily high altitude, over 4,000m, where there has never been human settlement that we know of, and where human settlement would seem impractical if not impossible, without extensive construction, supplies, inputs and so forth.""China´s ministry of ecology and environment could not be reached for comments.To the south of the Chinese areas that have seen new settlements, on the Indian side are states like Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim where construction of hydropower projects is going ahead full steam.But these are also the states that have been identified by the Central Water Commission of India as the ones that have seen significant expansion of glacial lakes and water bodies between 2009 and 2020, mainly because of melting glaciers.A study published by American Geophysical Union in 2020 found that of the 23 critical glacial lakes in India, 17 were in Sikkim. Such lakes are categorised as critical when they have filled up because of melting glaciers and are at risk of bursting. China and India have always worked together during international climate talks to protect their interest, often countering the West. Experts say such partnership is not as effective when it comes to dealing with the challenges of climate change or other environmental degradation in the Himalayas. Instead, experts say, geopolitical competition and hostility has driven both the Asian giants to ramp up all kinds of development activities, including military ones, in this hazard-prone zone.""This should have been an international biosphere reserve where no disturbance should have been allowed,"" says Jeffrey Kargel, an American geoscientist who has done many studies on the Himalayas.""But what we see today in the Himalayas is rising risks of hazards, growing exposure to such hazards, and as a result increasing vulnerability in the region.

"China Covid: More than 88 million people in Henan infected, official says - BBC News","Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Local Covid data is in stark contrast to that from central governmentBy Nicholas YongBBC NewsNearly 90% of people in Henan, China´s third most populous province, have now been infected with Covid, local health officials say.Provincial official Kan Quancheng revealed the figure - amounting to about 88.5 million people - at a press conference.China is battling an unprecedented surge in cases after abandoning zero-Covid policies in December.The move followed rare protests against lockdowns, quarantines and mass tests.Mr Kan did not specify a timeline for when all the infections happened - but as China´s previous zero-Covid policy kept cases to a minimum, it´s likely the vast majority of Henan´s infections occurred in the past few weeks.He said visits to fever clinics in Henan province peaked on 19 December ""after which it showed a continuous downward trend"".The Henan provincial figures are in stark contrast to Covid figures from the central governmentAccording to official data, just 120,000 people in the country of 1.4 billion have been infected and 30 died since the shift in Covid policy. Meanwhile on Sunday, authorities reported three Covid deaths in mainland China, one more than the day before.However, with the definition of Covid deaths narrowed and mass testing no longer compulsory, government data is no longer reflective of the true scale of the outbreak.Other local and provincial officials have also been providing very different data to that from the central government. On Christmas Eve, a senior health official in the port city of Qingdao reported that half a million people were being infected each day. Those case figures were swiftly removed from news reports. Young Chinese self-infect amid Covid fears for elderlyCelebrity deaths spark fears over China Covid tollMeanwhile Chinese health officials said they would not include Pfizer´s antiviral Covid medicine Paxlovid in its basic medical insurance schemes as a result of the high price quoted by the US firm.The drug, temporarily covered by China´s broad healthcare insurance scheme until 31 March, has seen a sharp increase in demand since China´s Covid cases surged last month.Pfizer would continue to collaborate with the Chinese government and all relevant stakeholders to ""secure and adequate supply"" of the medicine in China, the company said in a statement.On Sunday, Beijing also lifted mandatory quarantine for all international arrivals and opened its border with Hong Kong.In the first wave of pre-holiday travel, official data showed that 34.7 million people travelled domestically on Saturday. This represented an increase of more than a third compared to last year, according to state media.Infections are expected to soar as the country celebrates Lunar New Year later this month, with millions expected to travel from big cities to visit older relatives in the countryside.Overall, more than two billion individual journeys are expected to take place, officials have said.Listen to more on what we know about China´s Covid numbers: More or Less- Behind the Stats - Can China´s data on Covid deaths be trusted-  on BBC SoundsRelated TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64208127,09,01,2023,bbc,china
Why would China use a spy balloon when it has satellites? - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, The suspected Chinese spy balloon spotted over the city of Billings in the state of MontanaBy Kelly NgBBC NewsNews of an alleged Chinese spy balloon floating over the US has left many wondering why Beijing would want to use a relatively unsophisticated tool for its surveillance of the US mainland.China has said the balloon, spotted over the state of Montana, is merely a ""civilian airship"" which deviated from its planned route, but the US suspects it is a ""high-altitude surveillance"" device.Whatever the capabilities of this particular balloon, the US has taken the threat seriously enough to postpone Secretary of State Antony Blinken´s visit to China, which was due to take place on 5 and 6 February.Balloons are one of the oldest forms of surveillance technology. The Japanese military used them to launch incendiary bombs in the US during World War Two. They were also widely used by the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.More recently, the US has reportedly been considering adding high-altitude inflatables into the Pentagon´s surveillance network. Modern balloons typically hover between 24km-37km above the earth´s surface (80,000ft-120,000ft).""Beijing is probably trying to signal to Washington: ´While we want to improve ties, we are also ever ready for sustained competition, using any means necessary,´ without severely inflaming tensions,""  independent air-power analyst He Yuan Ming told the BBC. ""And what better tool for this than a seemingly innocuous balloon?""The balloon´s anticipated flight path near certain missile bases suggests it is unlikely it has drifted off course, He Yuan Ming said.How China sneaks out America´s technology secretsThe US wants to play in China´s backyardWas China balloon blown off course?High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesThe US Department of Defence on Thursday said the balloon is ""significantly above where civilian air traffic is active"". But China expert Benjamin Ho said Beijing had more sophisticated surveillance technology at its disposal. ""They have other means to spy out American infrastructure, or whatever information they wanted to obtain. The balloon was to send a signal to the Americans, and also to see how the Americans would react,"" explained Dr Ho - coordinator of the China programme at Singapore´s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.It may even be the case that China wanted the US to detect the balloon. ""It´s possible that being spotted was the whole point. China might be using the balloon to demonstrate that it has a sophisticated technological capability to penetrate US airspace without risking a serious escalation. In this regard, a balloon is a pretty ideal choice,"" said Arthur Holland Michel from the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.Nevertheless, the experts point out that balloons can be fitted with modern technology like spy cameras and radar sensors, and there are some advantages to using balloons for surveillance - chief of which is that it is less expensive and easier to deploy than drones or satellites. The balloon´s slower speed also allows it to loiter over and monitor the target area for longer periods. A satellite´s movement, on the other hand, is restricted to its orbital pass.Related TopicsAsiaChinaSurveillanceUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64508086,03,02,2023,bbc,china
New Porsche mistakenly put on sale at bargain price in China - BBC News,"Image source, PorscheImage caption, The Porsche Panamera has a starting price of $148,000 in ChinaBy Monica MillerBBC NewsPotential car buyers in China have found that an online advert for a luxury sports car was just too good to be true.A Porsche dealership in the the city of Yinchuan listed the brand new vehicle for 124,000 yuan ($18,300, £15,000).That is just a fraction of what it should have been. The Panamera has a starting price of $148,000.The promotion attracted hundreds of would-be buyers who rushed to secure what appeared to be a bargain.A spokesperson for the German car maker told the BBC that the promotion ""contained a serious mistake in the listed retail price"", which was taken down immediately.""As there was only one vehicle in stock, in accordance with the sales process, Porsche Centre Yinchuan has communicated with the first customer who made an online refunded reservation fee and has negotiated an agreeable outcome"", they added.VW values Porsche at up to $75bn in share saleLuxury cars up in smoke after ship catches fireThe dealership also contacted ""every bidder individually and explained the situation with apology"".The incorrect information was posted on 30 January and customers who paid the 911 yuan reservation fee have been refunded, Porsche said.The incident caused a stir on Chinese social media, with one commentator posting ""This is why I don´t buy Porsche lol"".Others thought that it was just a promotional strategy that was ""well conducted"".It was also suggested that the company had been ""irresponsible"" and should have honoured the cut-price offer.Another social media user claimed to be the first person to try to buy the car but had cancelled their order when they were told the real price. They said it would have been wrong to try to take advantage of a mistake.Porsche started selling cars in mainland China more than 20 years ago.In recent years the company expanded its footprint in the world´s second largest economy as it opened new dealerships.The country is now Porsche´s largest single market globally, with sales totalling $6.2bn in the first six months of last year.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Electric cars are said to be the future, but are we quite there yet?Related TopicsChinaCar industry",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64507453,03,02,2023,bbc,china
Covid-19: Indians told to mask up amid China coronavirus surge - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Indian government officials have asked people to follow Covid appropriate behaviourIndia´s health minister has called for a return to Covid-appropriate behaviour, including wearing masks in public, as the country steps up surveillance of cases.Top health officials have also asked people to get vaccinated and take booster doses.India had relaxed its mask-wearing rules earlier this year after a drop in infection levels.But a surge in cases in neighbouring China has put the country on alert.Over the past few months, India reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7, the Omicron subvariant linked to a spike in cases in China. The cases - three in Gujarat state and one in Odisha - were detected in July, September and November and the patients have recovered, health officials have said.According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases, but reports of the surge in China have created a sense of fear among many people. Several experts have said that India - which witnessed two deadly waves of Covid in 2020 and 2021 - does not have reason to panic.On Thursday, India´s health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in parliament that though cases in China were rising, those in India were ""depleting"". He added that the ministry was closely monitoring new variants and advised states to increase genome sequencing.Earlier this week, the federal government had asked states to send samples of all Covid positive patients to labs runs by a health ministry forum which monitors various strains of Covid in India.Mr Mandaviya also asked states to encourage people to follow social distancing and other rules during the upcoming festive season. Officials have now started conducting random Covid-19 tests on international passengers at airports .India had relaxed air travel guidelines in November, making it optional - ""though preferable"" - for passengers to wear masks on flights and for international passengers to be fully vaccinated. There has been no official announcement about a change in air travel guidelines yet.On Wednesday, Mr Mandaviya had chaired a high-level meeting with health officials to review the Covid situation in the country and appealed to people wear masks, maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and get vaccinated.Over 2.2 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country, but only 27% of the population have taken the booster dose - which India calls a ""precaution dose"" - so far. Chief ministers of several states have been reviewing their preparedness to deal with infections if needed. Later on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to review the situation.Read more India stories from the BBC:India beefs up military at tense China borderWHO stands by ´dangerous´ India cough syrup claimThe rape victim’s mum fighting for India’s daughtersIs India seeing a surge in grisly copycat murders?Indian´s search for dad´s lost grave ends in MalaysiaRelated TopicsAsiaIndiaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64061767,22,12,2022,bbc,china
Ukraine war: What support is China giving Russia? - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Presidents Putin and Xi met in February and discussed boosting tiesBy Reality CheckBBC NewsChina has become an increasingly important trading partner for Russia as it seeks to soften the impact of economic sanctions imposed by some countries in response to its invasion of Ukraine.  The United States now says Beijing is considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, allegations which China strongly denies.Is China providing Russia with weapons?China has been expanding its military production capabilities and is now the world´s fourth largest arms exporter.""China´s weapons are getting more advanced now,"" says Siemon Wezeman from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. ""Its drones, for example, are one area that Russia would be very interested in.""The US says Chinese firms have already provided ""non-lethal support"" to Russia, and that it has new information suggesting Beijing could soon provide ""lethal support"".Maria Shagina, an expert in economic sanctions at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, says China has not overtly supplied Russia with weapons but may be secretly selling it hi-tech products which could be used for military purposes.""There is evidence that China is the biggest exporter of semiconductors - often through shell companies in Hong Kong and the UAE - to Russia,"" she says.""Some Chinese companies are also supplying civilian drones, exploiting the grey space between military and civilian purposes.""The US-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies says Chinese companies may be sending Russia electronic parts for anti-aircraft missile radars. The US has also imposed sanctions on a Chinese company which Washington says has provided satellite imagery in support of Russian mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine. US sanctions Chinese firm helping Russia´s WagnerWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Russia´s most important trading partnerAfter Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Western nations imposed strict sanctions on Russia - banning imports of oil and exports of hi-tech products.Many Western firms cut their connections with Russia entirely, and its trade with the US, UK, and EU countries slumped over the course of 2022.However, China´s overall trade with Russia hit a record high level of $190bn in 2022 - a 30% increase on the year before.Russian imports from China increased 13% to $76bn and its exports to China increased by 43% to $114bn.As Russia´s trade with Western countries plunged in 2022, China became, by far and away, its most important trading partner.How much oil and gas is China buying from Russia?  Almost half of all the Russian government´s annual revenues come from oil and gas, and its sales to EU countries has plummeted over the past year as sanctions bite.  A significant amount of this shortfall has been made up with increased sales to Asia.Who is buying Russian oil and gasRussia exported twice as much liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to China in 2022 than it did the year before. It also delivered 50% more natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline, and 10% more crude oil. The G7 group of economically developed countries, along with the European Union and Australia, has tried to impose a worldwide cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea, but China has refused to comply and buys Russian crude at market prices.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s terminal in Tianjin receives liquified natural gas from RussiaThere are also longer term plans to expand energy ties.

It added that Beijing ""would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype"" and accused ""some politicians and media in the United States"" of using the incident ""as a pretext to attack and smear China.""According to US officials, the airship floated over Alaska and Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.The incident angered top US officials, with Mr Blinken saying he had told Beijing the balloon´s presence was ""a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law"" and ""an irresponsible act"".

How has China reacted to the balloon saga? - BBC News,"Image source, Chinese Ministry of Foreign AffairsImage caption, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning says the US overreactedBy Tessa Wong & Fan WangBBC NewsChina´s claim that the US has flown balloons into its airspace marks the latest in a series of shifting positions the country has taken on a saga that has gripped the world.It has been almost two weeks since the US first accused China of floating a spy balloon over its territory.The incident has provoked a range of responses - from indignation to fevered speculation - from the Chinese government and people.Silence, then admissionAfter the Pentagon first announced the existence of the balloon on 2 February, Chinese officials refrained from an immediate response, only breaking their silence the following evening. In a statement they admitted the object belonged to them, but added it was a ""civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes"" that had been blown off-course.Taking a near-apologetic tone - rare for Beijing - they characterised it as an accident, saying they ""regretted the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure"".But state media, which had mostly held off from reporting the story until the government´s admission, got more defensive.China Daily claimed the ""fabricated balloon lie cannot be tied down to China"", while the Global Times urged the US ""to be more sincere in fixing relations with China instead of making provocative actions against it"".Netizens wasted no time in making jokes about the incident, with many calling the object ""The Wandering Balloon"" - a reference to the popular Chinese science-fiction novel and film The Wandering Earth.The morning after, Chinese authorities released a longer, more vigorous defence as news broke that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had called off a planned trip to China, claiming that ""some politicians and media in the US have hyped it up to attack and smear China"".That same day, the US shot the balloon down - prompting Chinese ire.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning called it a ""a clear overreaction"" and ""unacceptable and irresponsible"". ""The airship does not belong to the US. It belongs to China,"" she said, when asked if China had requested for the balloon´s remnants to be returned. Officials lodged a formal complaint with the US embassy in Beijing, and China´s Defence Ministry said they ""reserved the right to use necessary means to deal with similar situations"".Online, Chinese nationalists indignantly denounced the US. Prominent commentator Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of Global Times, thought the US ""had to end"" the situation by using a missile, because Americans ""aren´t able to treat an accident by seeking truth from facts, instead they had to politicise it"".Meanwhile, a second balloon was spotted drifting over Latin America, which Chinese authorities also admitted was theirs.Speculation mountsOn the Chinese internet there was fevered speculation about who exactly had launched the balloon, in the absence of details about its civilian origins.Many seized upon recent news articles that mentioned a local company, ChemChina Zhuzhou Rubber Research and Design Institute, as one of the main producers of high-altitude balloons in China.Some bloggers claimed ChemChina Zhuzhou, a subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise, had made the balloon. But there has been no evidence linking the company to the airship.The confusion deepened on Sunday, when a report came out in news outlet The Paper about an unidentified object allegedly flying off the coast of the eastern Shandong province.It said fisheries officials had sent out a warning to local fishermen that Chinese authorities were preparing to shoot down the object.  The report was reproduced by some Chinese outlets, but state media and government departments remained silent. It sent social media into overdrive nonetheless, with some accounts even live streaming satellite images of the area. But some online reacted with suspicion and asked if it was real, questioning why the news had not been announced on more official channels.Turning the narrativeOn Monday, the Chinese government had a new claim - that US balloons had breached their airspace at least 10 times in the past year.""The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman. The US has denied the accusation.Chinese balloon sensors recovered from ocean, says USChina´s foreign affairs committee on Thursday issued a formal condemnation of US lawmakers´ response to the balloon as ""purely malicious hype and political manipulation"".""In fact, it is the United States that wantonly interferes in other countries´ internal affairs, violates their sovereignty, and conducts surveillance on other countries,"" the committee´s resolution said.At the same time, state media has begun focusing on a different narrative - a derailed train carrying hazardous material in Ohio.Though the incident happened in early February, Chinese news outlets are now devoting significant coverage on the topic, citing US media reports. US officials have performed a controlled release of toxic chemicals from the train to prevent contamination.It has since become a significant talking point on social media. On Weibo, China´s equivalent to Twitter, the main Ohio train hashtag has been viewed more than 690 million times since the weekend, with more than 40 hashtags created on the topic.Many Chinese netizens have expressed worry that the incident would turn into a global environmental crisis, and anger over the relatively sparser coverage of the train incident in US media compared to the balloons.""Turns out the Wandering Balloon was being used to take the heat for Ohio,"" a post liked nearly 3,000 times reads.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsRelated TopicsChinaSurveillanceUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64633990,16,02,2023,bbc,china
China's Xi to meet Putin in Moscow next week - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersBy Steve Rosenberg, Stephen McDonell and James Landalein Moscow, Beijing and KyivChina´s President Xi Jinping will travel to Moscow next week to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, officials say. The Kremlin said they would discuss a ""comprehensive partnership and strategic co-operation"".The visit comes as Beijing, an ally of Russia, has offered proposals to end the war in Ukraine, to which the West has given a lukewarm reception.Western countries have warned Beijing against supplying Moscow with weapons. This will be President Xi´s first visit to Russia since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. He is due to have lunch with Mr Putin on Monday followed by talks on Tuesday. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said China would uphold ""an objective and fair position"" on the war in Ukraine and ""play a constructive role in promoting talks for peace"". UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak´s spokesperson said that China playing a genuine role in restoring sovereignty to Ukraine would be welcomed.   Ukraine won´t forget who backed us - foreign ministerChina´s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visit What support is China giving Russia? The fact the Chinese leader is going to Russia signals Beijing´s strong support for Moscow. There´s no surprise about that: Mr Putin and Mr Xi share a similar world view, both embrace the idea of a multi-polar world.Last year the two men declared their partnership has no limits. That´s not strictly true.Up until now China has not supplied Russia with lethal aid to help it win the war in Ukraine, though the US claims China is considering doing so.As for the declared partnership between Moscow and Beijing, Russia - with an economy a 10th the size of China´s - finds itself increasingly in the role of junior partner.So the Chinese government definitely has some sway over Russia. Other elements driving interest in this visit are Beijing´s claim to be neutral and that it has not opposed speculation that it could act as an honest broker between Moscow and Kyiv.It may not be a coincidence that Monday´s meeting takes place on the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, which was opposed by both Russia and China.Crucially, China is coming off the back of a major diplomatic coup, having facilitated a deal for Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia to resume diplomatic relations.However some argue that its stated neutrality is a sham and it is in Beijing´s geopolitical interests for the war to continue because Russia is doing its dirty work - taking on the West and eating up Western resources and money.China´s proposals called for peace negotiations and respect for national sovereignty. But the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsIn February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Xi - ""I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,"" he said. Some US media have reported that Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky will speak by phone after the Chinese leader´s visit to Moscow, but this is yet to be confirmed.Kyiv has been pushing hard for some kind of engagement. Ukraine believes President Xi is making the visit to send a signal to the world that Russia has at least some allies. In an interview with the BBC before President Xi´s visit was announced, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said: ""I don´t think China has reached the moment now when it wants to, when it´s ready to arm Russia. Nor do I think that this visit will result in peace… The visit to Moscow in itself is a message but I don´t think it will have any immediate consequences.""The message, Mr Kuleba said, was ""that China and Russia are very close, close enough for the Chinese leader to visit his Russian counterpart, who is not doing very well. ""And I think this is the message to the entire world, to the West but also most importantly, to the non-West, that Russia is not alone, that China is talking to them.""The US is keen for Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky to be in contact. The US National Security Council´s spokesman said it would be ""a very good thing if the two of them talk"". On Thursday, China´s foreign minister urged Kyiv and Moscow to restart peace talks as soon as possible during a phone call with Mr Kuleba, who in turn said the two had discussed the ""significance of the principle of territorial integrity"".Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingChinaRussiaVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64986486,17,03,2023,bbc,china
Covid in China: US imposes Covid testing for visitors from China - BBC News,"Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, ReutersImage caption, China is starting to reopen borders after three yearsBy Alys Davies and Frances MaoBBC NewsThe US has become the latest country to impose Covid testing on visitors from China, after Beijing announced it would reopen borders next week.Italy, Japan, Taiwan and India also announced mandatory tests, but Australia and UK said there were no new rules for travellers from China.After three years of being closed to the world, China will let people travel more freely from 8 January.But the country´s ongoing Covid surge has sparked wariness. China is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily case load may be closer to a million. Hospitals are overwhelmed and residents are struggling to find basic medicines, according to reports. On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.How many Covid cases are there in China?´Everyone I know is getting a fever´ - Covid hits China The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"".But Beijing´s foreign ministry on Wednesday had said coronavirus rules should only be instated on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of  ""hyping up"" the situation.Some people reacted angrily on China´s censored social media. ""I thought all of the foreign countries had opened up. Isn´t this racism?"" read one comment that was liked 3,000 times on Weibo. The US has said testing is required of anyone coming from China, or via a third country, regardless of nationality.But others said they understood the reason for the conditions: ""This is nothing compared to all the restrictions we had for people coming into China,"" one user wrote. Beijing only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020. Until this week, anyone entering China had to undergo quarantine in state facilities. Before the pandemic, China had been the world´s largest outbound tourism market. But it´s unclear how many Chinese people will travel abroad after 8 January given that the number of flights are limited, and many citizens need to renew their passports. The international community´s reaction has varied with the UK and Australia saying they were monitoring China´s Covid situation but were not planning on announcing new testing requirements.  Others have moved swiftly to announce restrictions:In Japan, from Friday, travellers from China will be tested for Covid upon arrival. Those who test positive will have to quarantine for up to seven days. The number of flights to and from China will also be restrictedIn India, people travelling from China and four other Asian countries must produce a negative Covid test before arriving. Positive passengers will also be put in quarantineTaiwan says people arriving on flights from China, as well as by boat at two islands, will have to take Covid tests on arrival from 1 January to 31 January. Those who test positive will be able to isolate at homeMeanwhile Malaysia has put additional tracking and surveillance measures in placeItaly has also imposed mandatory Covid testing on travellers from ChinaThe European Commission said its health security committee would convene on Thursday to discuss ""possible measures for a coordinated EU approach"" to China´s Covid surge. But Italy, an EU member state and an epicentre of the virus in late 2019 and 2020, said it was moving first to ""ensure the surveillance and identification"" of any new variants of the virus.Flights arriving in Milan this week were already testing passengers from China. Authorities found 52% of passengers were infected with Covid on one flight that landed on 26 December.Initial tests of Covid-positive travellers arriving from China showed that 15 of them had Omicron variants that were already present in Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said. She described the news as quite reassuring.Italy is one of 26 European countries in the border-free Schengen zone and Ms Meloni is calling for EU-wide testing of Chinese passengers, arguing that Italy´s own measures might otherwise be ineffective. China´s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that ""currently the development of China´s epidemic situation is overall predictable and under control"". However, the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. On Sunday, officials said they would also stop releasing daily case counts.""The infection surge in China is on expected lines,"" Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an Indian epidemiologist and health systems specialist told the BBC in a recent interview. ""If you have a susceptible population that is not exposed to the virus, cases will rise. Nothing has changed for the rest of the world.""China´s decision to reopen its borders marks the end of the country´s controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed. Even as the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing insisted on an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdowns.The economy took a hit and people grew both exhausted and angry - in November, the frustration spilled onto the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. Week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions.Related TopicsTourismAsiaTravelChinaCoronavirus testingCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64111492,29,12,2022,bbc,china
Bao Fan: Billionaire tech banker in China reported missing - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Top investment firm China Renaissance says it has been unable to contact chief executive Bao FanBy Joel Guinto, Fan Wang and Frances MaoBBC NewsOne of China´s most high-profile billionaire bankers has gone missing, his company has reported.Bao Fan, the chief executive of China Renaissance Holdings, had not been able to be reached in recent days, the firm said in a market update on Thursday.Mr Bao is a leading deal broker in China whose clients include top tech companies Didi and Meituan.His firm´s announcement has renewed concerns of a potential Beijing crackdown on finance and tech figures.Shares in the investment firm plunged on Friday, after it told shareholders it had ""been unable to contact Mr Bao Fan"". The board added it was not aware of ""any information that indicates that Mr Bao´s unavailability is or might be related to the business and/or operations of the group"".When asked for further comment, China Renaissance referred the BBC to its notice to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company did not specify how long Mr Bao had been missing. Chinese business newswire Caixin cited sources saying staff had not been able to contact him for two days.The business wire also reported the firm´s president, Cong Lin, had been taken by authorities last September over his previous work at the state-owned ICBC bank. China Renaissance appears to not have commented on Mr Cong´s situation. He is no longer listed as an executive on the company´s site or in its most recent interim report.The disappearance of Mr Bao - one of China´s leading tech investors - has again evoked a history of Chinese executives suddenly vanishing for periods of time with no explanation.At least half a dozen billionaires in the past few years have disappeared for periods after reported run-ins with the Communist Party, according to Forbes Magazine.In several cases they were suspected to have been ensnared in corruption, tax or other misconduct investigations.Notable absences include that of Fosun group founder Guo Guangchang, who has been called the Warren Buffet of China, who vanished for several days in 2015. Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua was also taken in 2017. He had been one of China´s richest people and last year was jailed for corruption.In late 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma also disappeared from public view for three months, after making comments critical of market regulators. He had been due to publicly list his digital payments firm Ant Financial - which would have most likely made him the richest man in China.Mr Bao is seen as a titan in China´s tech industry, having executed many of the trades that have shaped its online consumer economy. He founded China Renaissance in 2005 after a banking career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.His company was behind landmark deals including Tencent´s strategic investment in JD.com, and mergers of ride-hailing power players Didi and Kuaidi, advert sites 58.com and Ganji, and food delivery giants Meituan and Dianping.China Renaissance has also advised the initial public offerings of e-commerce sites JD.com and Kuashou, as well as Didi´s listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.In a 2018 article, Mr Bao wrote that his company had ""cross paths"" with 70% of the internet companies known by the Chinese public.Related TopicsChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64672095,17,02,2023,bbc,china
Taliban and China firm agree Afghanistan oil extraction deal - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The deal would be the first oil extraction agreement with a foreign firm since the Taliban took powerBy Peter HoskinsBusiness reporterAfghanistan´s Taliban government is to sign a contract with a Chinese firm to drill for oil in the country´s north.It would be first major energy extraction agreement with a foreign firm since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021.The 25-year deal underscores China´s economic involvement in the region.On Thursday Taliban officials said security forces had targeted Islamic State group militants who attacked a hotel used by Chinese businessmen.Eight IS militants were killed and several more arrested, the Taliban said.December´s attack on the Longan Hotel in Kabul saw at least three people killed and 18 more injured, including five Chinese citizens.The oil extraction agreement would see Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Company (CAPEIC) drilling for oil in the Amu Darya basin, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.""The Amu Darya oil contract is an important project between China and Afghanistan,"" China´s ambassador to Afghanistan Wang Yu told a news conference in the capital Kabul.A Chinese state-owned company is also in talks over the operation of a copper mine in the east of the country.Foreign aid groups halt work after Taliban ban womenThe Taliban´s broken promisesAfghanistan is estimated to be sitting on natural resources - including natural gas, copper and rare earths - worth more than $1tn.However, much of those reserves remain untapped due to decades of turmoil in the country.Beijing has not formally recognised Afghanistan´s Taliban administration but it has significant interests in the country, which is at the centre of a region important to China´s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Launched by Xi Jinping in 2013, the BRI provides financing for emerging countries to build infrastructure like ports, roads and bridges.Related TopicsAfghanistanChinaOil",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64183083,06,01,2023,bbc,china
TikTok says US threatens ban if China stake not sold - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy James Clayton & Ben DericoBBC News, San FranciscoThe US government says TikTok should be sold or else face a possible ban in the country.The video-sharing app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is accused of posing a national security risk through data gathered from millions of users.A request for a change in ownership, first reported in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), was confirmed to BBC News by TikTok.The company said a forced sale would not change its data flows or access.The White House has not yet responded to a BBC News request for comment.For years American officials have raised concerns that data from the popular app could fall into the hands of the Chinese government.According to the WSJ, US President Joe Biden´s administration wants ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok to create a clear break from China. The newspaper said the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), which oversees national security risks, unanimously recommended ByteDance divest from TikTok.A spokesperson for TikTok said it did not dispute the WSJ´s reporting and confirmed it had been contacted by CFIUS. However, the spokesperson said the reporting was overstated and it was not clear what ""divestiture"" meant in practice. ""If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn´t solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,"" the spokesperson said. ""The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems.""A ban was first threatened under then-President Donald Trump in 2020. However, Mr Biden´s administration has also taken a dim view of the social network.TikTok hoovers up huge amounts of data on its users, similar to Instagram and Twitter. It can take biometric data from users and has access to location data. The fear is the information could be passed to the Chinese government. TikTok says it has undertaken an effort to move all US-based data to the US as part of an initiative it calls Project Texas.The company has told BBC News it still plans to move forward with that plan.Should we be worried about TikTok?TikTok under investigation by Canadian privacy authoritiesChina hits out as US bans TikTok on federal devicesThe development comes a week after new legislation was unveiled in the senate, which could expand the president´s authority to ban TikTok nationwide. The Restrict Act would allow the US Commerce Department to declare foreign-linked companies national security risks. TikTok is banned on government phones in the US, Canada and the EU. Its chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, is set to testify before the US Congress next week in a widely anticipated showdown.Related TopicsTikTokUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64973156,16,03,2023,bbc,china
Holding out against China in a row over reefs - BBC News,"Image source, Philippine Coast GuardImage caption, The Philippines has accused China of shining lasers on one of its boats - which Beijing deniesBy Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, ManilaChina has had an unusually busy and bizarre week. On Monday - as the saga over the alleged spy balloon dragged into its 11th day - a fresh spat erupted between Beijing and Manila. This one was over lasers. The Philippines accused China of using a ""military grade"" laser light on a Philippine coastguard boat. It said the incident had happened on 6 February when the boat  was attempting to take supplies to the Sierra Madre, a vessel that is used as a Filipino naval outpost in the South China Sea; and that a Chinese vessel intercepted the Filipino coast guard boat, blocked its way and used a laser device to temporarily blind the crew. It´s not clear what sort of device the Chinese crew used or how powerful it was, but laser weapons designed to damage eyesight are banned under UN convention. The incident has been quickly condemned by a host of countries including the United States, Australia, Japan and Germany.  China for its part defended its right to use lasers to protect its ""sovereignty"", and then denied shining the light at the Filipino crew, saying they had used a ""hand-held laser speed detector and hand-held greenlight pointer"", neither of which are dangerous. All this over a submerged reef. In 2014, the BBC visited the South China Sea in search of the Sierra Madre. As the sun rose across the South China Sea, the horizon showed no sign of our quarry. ""Don´t worry,"" shouted the skipper who was taking us to the ship above the sound of the engine, ""I know where I´m going. It´s on the reef over there."" He pointed north and out of the morning mist appeared a rusting grey hulk sitting, grounded, atop the vast submerged reef visible just a few feet below the water. The Sierra Madre was not a particularly grand ship even in its youth. Built as a tank landing ship during World War Two, it served with the US navy in the Vietnam war. In 1970 she was transferred to the South Vietnamese navy, and after the fall of Saigon in 1975 she ended up in the Philippines. In 1999 the ageing ship was deliberately beached on top of this reef 160km (100 miles) off the Philippine coast. Image caption, The Sierra Madre is beached on the Second Thomas ShoalAs the little fishing boat drew close, large holes rusted right through the ship´s hull became visible. It looked like the next typhoon would wash her away.  Nearly 10 years on, the Sierra Madre is somehow still holding together, more rust and concrete, than steel. And a tiny contingent of Filipino marines still live a precarious existence aboard. The actions of the Chinese coastguard ship in blocking the Philippine vessel may also breach international law. Whatever Beijing says, the waters around the rusting Sierra Madre do not belong to China. In 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague made a clear ruling. China´s claim to a large swathe of the South China Sea, often defined as the nine-dash line, has no basis in international law. Of course, it´s not quite as simple as that.  There are numerous claims and counter-claims to the islands, reefs and waters of the South China Sea. China´s is only the most expansive. The Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia all have their own overlapping claims to smaller bits of the sea. And most of those claims are also not supported by international law. The Philippines´ rusting Sierra Madre sits atop a reef variously known as Second Thomas Shoal, Ayungin Shoal and - in Chinese - Ren-ai Reef. But a submerged reef is not land and controlling a reef does not give a country any new territorial waters and does not expand its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). There is almost no real land in the South China Sea. In the most hotly contested area, known as the Spratly Islands, there are a handful of tiny islets. The biggest is called Taiping Dao. It´s just 1,000 metres long and 400 metres wide. By an accident of history, it has ended up under the control of Taiwan. The second biggest is called Pagasa. You can walk around it in half an hour. Pagasa was snatched by the Philippines in 1971, when the Taiwanese troops stationed there withdrew to escape a powerful typhoon. Vietnam has a few other scraps of land. But China, distracted by the internal turmoil of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, was too late - and ended up with no real land. So, it decided to make its own. In 2014, while a handful of Filipino marines clung to the rusting decks of the Sierra Madre, 40km (25 miles) away on another atoll called Mischief Reef, China had begun a massive land reclamation project. The world´s largest ocean-going dredgers were pumping millions of tonnes of gravel and sand on to the top of the reef creating a huge artificial island. The new land China has made at Mischief Reef is well inside the Philippines´ internationally recognised 320 km (200 mile) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The new island is not recognised by international law. It does not give China the right to 20 km (12 mile) territorial waters. But that has not stopped Beijing from using its large coastguard and maritime militia fleet, to enforce its claims, and to drive away Philippine fishermen and challenge Philippine coastguard vessels.China´s new islands are what military strategists call ""facts on the ground"" -  in other words this is the reality, rather than an abstract legal concept. The fear in Manila is that China´s ambitions do not stop at Mischief Reef. Ayungin Shoal could be next. That´s why the rusting hulk of the Sierra Madre holds such symbolic importance here. It´s also why after a 30-year absence, the government of President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr, is opening the door for large numbers of US troops to return to bases in the Philippines.

Newspaper headlines: Harry interview reaction and 'US China fears' - BBC News,"By BBC NewsStaffImage source, ReutersMany of Monday´s papers focus on Prince Harry´s ITV interview. The Daily Telegraph highlights his claim that his brother and sister-in-law stereotyped his wife, Meghan, as a ""divorced, bi-racial, American actress"", and never really accepted her from the beginning.  The paper also believes the Duke of Sussex didn´t receive as easy a ride as he might have expected from the interviewer Tom Bradby - whom it describes as his ""pal"".  It suggests Mr Bradby refused to let Prince Harry off the hook, and questioned him about his claims to the point where the interview became ""testier"".""We Never Called Royals Racist"" is the Sun´s headline.  It´s a reference to Harry´s attempt to row back on claims made in the couple´s interview with Oprah Winfrey last year.  It suggests viewers will have been ""astonished"" last night, that he denied he and Meghan had accused the Royal Family of racism.  The paper´s editorial says Harry seems to have ""fallen into a deep, dark well of self-obsession"".  The Mirror also concentrates on the attempt to clarify the racism claims - arguing that he´s left it too late to back away from a damaging allegation.The Daily Express, though, thinks Harry has ""put the record straight"" - in what it called an ´extraordinary´ TV interview.  The paper´s royal correspondent feels that the prince tackled the most damaging allegation - that the royals were racist - and that the clarification would be welcomed by them. But the Express criticises Harry for writing the memoir in the first place - suggesting he has ""sold his soul"".  It´s a view the Daily Mail shares.  It says Harry may have tarnished his reputation with what it calls his ""tawdry"" memoir.  Its coverage of yesterday´s interview leads on Harry´s belief that fellow royals were complicit in what he calls the pain and suffering inflicted on his wife.  ""My Family Helped Drive Meghan Out"", is the headline.The same claim preoccupies the Times - but it suggests that Harry was holding out an olive branch to his family - by declaring that the royals weren´t racists.  The paper also reports that King Charles was seen in public for the first time since details of the book emerged - and appeared in good spirits.  Its front page photograph is of events in Brazil, and shows supporters of Jair Bolsonaro storming government buildings.The Guardian also has a picture of the unrest in Brazil, but it leads on hopes of a possible breakthrough on a pay deal for striking nurses.  The paper says it understands that ministers - who are due to hold talks with their unions today - are now prepared to look at a one-off payment, after Downing Street and the Treasury were accused of blocking such a move last month.There´s a big photo on the front of the Financial Times of a passenger being welcomed at Shanghai´s Pudong airport - after China lifted Covid quarantine requirements for international arrivals yesterday.  It also has a report that American and Japanese armed forces are integrating their command structures, to prepare for possible conflict with China, because of tension.Related Internet LinksDaily ExpressDaily MailDaily MirrorDaily StarDaily TelegraphFinancial TimesGuardianIndependentMetroMorning StarSunTimesThe iBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

US-China chip war: America is winning - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The fight for dominance in the semiconductor sector is reshaping the global economyBy Suranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentFor more than a century the scramble for oil unleashed wars, forced unusual alliances and sparked diplomatic rows. Now the world´s two biggest economies are battling over another precious resource: semiconductors, the chips that literally power our daily life.These tiny fragments of silicon are at the heart of a $500bn industry that is expected to double by 2030. And whoever controls the supply chains - a tangled network of companies and countries that make the chips - holds the key to being an unrivalled superpower.China wants the technology to produce chips. That´s why the US, a source of much of the tech, is cutting Beijing off. The two countries are clearly engaged in an arms race in the Asia Pacific, says Chris Miller, author of Chip Wars and associate professor at Tufts University. But, he adds, there´s more to the race: ""[It] takes place both in traditional spheres, like numbers of ships, or missiles produced but increasingly, it´s taking place in terms of the quality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that can be employed in military systems."" For now, the US is winning - but the chip war it has declared on China is reshaping the global economy. The chip-makersThe manufacture of semiconductors is complex, specialist and deeply integrated. An iPhone has chips that are designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, then assembled in China. India, which is investing more in the industry, could play a bigger role in the future. Semiconductors were invented in the US, but over time East Asia emerged as a manufacturing hub, largely because of government incentives, including subsidies. This allowed Washington to develop business ties and strategic alliances in a region vulnerable to Russian influence during the Cold War. It´s just as useful now, in the face of Beijing´s growing influence in the Asia Pacific.The race is on to make the best and most efficient chips at scale - and the smaller, the better. The challenge: how many transistors - tiny electrical switches that can turn a current on or off - can you fit onto the smallest bit of a silicon wafer?""It´s what the semiconductor industry calls Moore´s law, essentially doubling the transistor density over time, and that´s a hard goal to achieve,"" said Jue Wang, a partner at Silicon Valley at Bain & Company.""It´s what enables our phones to get faster, our digital photo archive to get bigger, our smart home devices to get smarter over time and our social media content to get richer."" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Washington is trying to cut China off from the tech that makes chipsGetting there is not easy even for the top chip-makers. In mid-2022, Samsung became the first company to start mass producing three-nanometre chips at scale. Later that year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) - the world´s biggest chip-maker and a major supplier to Apple - followed. How narrow is that? Much narrower than a strand of human hair, which is about 50 to 100,000 nanometres. These smaller ""leading edge"" chips are more powerful, which means they go into more valuable devices - supercomputers and AI, the internet of things. The market for ""lagging edge"" chips - which power the more mundane bits of our lives, such as microwaves, washing machines and refrigerators - is lucrative too. But demand will likely wither in the future. Most of the world´s chips are currently being made in Taiwan, giving the self-ruled island what its President calls a ""silicon shield"" - in other words, protection from China, which claims the territory. Beijing too has made chip production a national priority and is investing aggressively in supercomputers and AI. It is nowhere near being a global leader but has been catching up quickly in the past decade, especially in its chip design capabilities, Mr Miller says. ""What you find historically is that whenever powerful countries have advanced computing technology, they deploy them to intelligence and military systems,"" he added.This, and the dependence on Taiwan and other Asian countries for supply, is rattling America. How is the US hobbling China´s progress?The Biden administration is trying to choke China´s access to the technology that makes chips.Last October, Washington announced sweeping export controls making it virtually impossible for companies to sell chips, chip-making equipment, and software containing US tech to China, no matter where they are based in the world. It also banned US citizens and permanent residents from supporting the ""development or production"" of chips at certain factories in China. How the US-China chip war is playing outUS tries to take on China with huge tech investmentThis hits China hard because it imports both the hardware and the talent that fuels its nascent chip-making industry. The Netherlands´ ASML stands to lose about a quarter of the revenue it used to earn from China. It´s the only company that makes the most advanced lithographic machines - the tools that make ""leading edge"" chips. ""Talent is so important in this area... if you look at the executives of China´s semiconductor companies, a lot of them hold American passports, they are trained in the US, and they have green cards. So that is a really big problem for China,"" says Linghao Bao, analyst at policy research firm Trivium China. The US also wants to make more chips. The Chips and Science Act offers $53bn of grants and subsidies to companies making semiconductors in the US. Major players are taking advantage of that. TSMC is investing in two plants worth $40 billion in the US, their only facilities outside of Taiwan. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China buys more than 50% of the chips manufactured globallyMicron, the largest US-based manufacturer of memory chips - essential for supercomputers, military hardware and any device that has a processor - has announced plans to spend up to $100bn over the next 20 years in a computer chip plant in upstate New York.""The Chips Act is able to bridge the cost gap that exists in production in the US versus Asia,"" says Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive of Micron Technology. ""Micron will continue to invest in our fabs [plants] in Asia. What is important is that there´ll be a level playing field across the globe.""China´s play The US´s restrictions are hitting China where it hurts. Apple reportedly shelved a deal to buy memory chips from one of China´s most successful chip companies, Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC), in the wake of the restrictions.Global TradeMore from the BBC´s series taking an international perspective on trade.The Huawei experience is how this is likely to play out, according to Mr Bao. The communications giant went from being the second-largest smartphone maker in the world, after Samsung, to ""essentially dead"", Mr Bao says.""So that´s how easy it was for Washington to cripple a Chinese tech company. China doesn´t really have a good option to respond to that. Previously, the US was targeting individual Chinese companies. But this time, the scope has expanded to the entire country.""US bans sale of Chinese tech amid security fearsTwo Huawei 5G kit-removal deadlines put backCan China do anything in response? Withdrawing goods or services, or imposing its own export controls, could do more damage than good at a time when its economy is facing a severe slowdown.Beijing has complained to the World Trade Organization (WTO) but a resolution could take years.Meanwhile, experts say, China will double down on investment and support for its domestic chip-making industry.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, US policy has effectively killed Huawei´s smartphone business""We will focus national strategic needs, gather strength to carry out indigenous and leading scientific and technological research, and resolutely win the battle in key core technologies,"" President Xi Jinping said at the Chinese Communist Party´s 20th Congress in October.What comes next?In the short term, the industry has to contend with a global slowdown because of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and a bumpy re-opening of China´s economy. Beijing will want to tread carefully given that its economy took a huge hit through the Covid pandemic.""There will still be a lot of back and forth between US companies, Taiwanese companies, Chinese companies and firms from other countries. It´s really only at the cutting edge in logic and memory chips, where we´re going to see a concerted effort by the US to cut China out of innovation networks and an effort by China to build up its own US-free supply chain,"" Mr Miller said.He adds that could mean a partial decoupling of the ecosystem - one focused on China and one on the rest of the world.That has huge ramifications for the global economy. It will force players to pick sides, possibly cutting many off from accessing the Chinese market.

Li Qiang, the former Communist Party leader of the country´s biggest city of Shanghai, will now lead the government, replacing retiring Li Keqiang.The 63-year-old received almost every vote from more than 2,900 delegates at the National People´s Congress.A close ally of Mr Xi, he is seen as a pragmatist and will be tasked with reviving China´s struggling economy.New ministerial appointments are expected to be announced on Sunday.No reporters were allowed in the room while ballots were cast during a meeting of China´s rubber-stamp parliament. There was applause as Mr Xi cast his vote. Mr Li - who is now the second-highest ranking official in China´s political system - received a total of 2,936 votes, with just three delegates voting against his appointment and eight abstaining.He then took an oath, swearing to be loyal to China´s constitution and to ""work hard to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilised, harmonious and great modern socialist country"".Mr Li was President Xi´s chief of staff in the early 2000s, when Mr Xi was party chief of Zhejiang province. Mr Li was made party secretary of Shanghai in 2017.During the pandemic, he oversaw Shanghai´s strict lockdown, which led to some residents struggling to access food and medical care. His appointment comes after Mr Xi secured a historic third term as president on Friday.The president has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests. The country is also facing a falling birth rate that threatens its economic growth engine.The so-called Two Sessions of the National People´s Congress and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into China´s direction in the coming years.Since Mao Zedong, leaders in China had been limited to two terms in office.

China: Five dead after man drives into crowd in Guangzhou - BBC News,"Image source, WeiboImage caption, Pictures circulating online show the badly dented carBy Grace TsoiBBC NewsChinese police have arrested a man who drove a car into pedestrians in Guangzhou, killing five people and injuring 13 others. The incident has sparked widespread public outrage, with many accusing the man of deliberately targeting people.Videos posted online show the driver getting out of the car and throwing banknotes into the air, shortly after the crash.Police have detained the 22-year-old man and launched an investigation.The crash took place on Wednesday during the evening rush hour at a busy junction in the southern city of 19 million.""He deliberately drove into the people who were waiting for the traffic light. He rammed the car into them maliciously. After that, he made a U-turn and hit people again,"" an eyewitness told local outlet Hongxin News.""He wasn´t driving too quickly, but some people couldn´t run away in time because they wouldn´t have known he was hitting people deliberately.""The man also reportedly drove into a traffic police officer and his motorcycle, but the officer managed to escape. One widely circulated clip shows a young girl lying on the ground at the scene of the incident, while a woman said to be her mother is seen by her side wailing.Another eyewitness described the chaos of the aftermath on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter. The person said that an hour after the incident, the site was still filled with ambulances and traffic police ""and they had not moved all the injured and the bodies from the scene"". ""The scene was too tragic and I couldn´t bear seeing it. I felt so sad that I wanted to throw up whenever I heard the siren of the ambulance,"" the person said.The incident has sparked public anger, with many expressing sorrow that it happened in the lead-up to Chinese New Year, a time for family reunions. ""The victims could be a girl who dressed up meticulously to go on a date… It could be a food deliveryman who earned five yuan after rushing an order. It could be a father who wanted to go home and have dinner with children. It could be a child who was happily shopping,"" one Weibo user wrote.Many noted that the man drove a luxury car and had thrown money into the air, and asked if he came from a rich and powerful family.The incident quickly became a trending topic on Weibo on Wednesday, but it later disappeared from the ""hot searches"" list, leading users to accuse the platform of censorship.There have been similar recent incidents. In February 2022, a driver ploughed a mini truck into people in the southern province of Fujian, killing three and injuring nine.

TikTok launches Project Clover to allay China security fears - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersBy Chris VallanceTechnology reporterTikTok has launched security measures to allay concerns it could be made to share user data with China.Project Clover will see a separate security company ""monitor data flows"" - and TikTok will make it harder to identify individual users in data.""Security gateways"" will add an extra layer of control over employee access to European user information and data transfers outside of Europe, it says.The European Commission has banned the ByteDance-owned app from staff devices.´Earn trust´As part of its current effort to store European user data locally, TikTok revealed plans for two new data centres, costing a total of €1.2bn (£1.1bn) every year, in Dublin, in addition to one already announced, and the Hamar region of Norway.Both will be renewably powered and operated by third parties.The company has been working on Project Clover since last year. ""We´re ahead of the curve on this because we have to be - because we need to earn trust,"" TikTok vice-president of government relations and public policy in Europe Theo Bertram said.A similar plan, Project Texas, is under way in the US. Its back against the wall, TikTok is fighting hard to prove it is no national-security threat.Executives unveiling Project Clover repeatedly said they were going further than other major social networks to protect user privacy.And I can´t think of a time when a Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat held a press conference announcing sweeping privacy changes, with an open Q and A.But will it be enough to save the platform?Chinese telecoms giant Huawei bent over backwards to convince governments it could be trusted.It spent a fortune setting up a transparency centre in Oxfordshire, where for years UK cyber chiefs poured over source code looking for signs of Chinese government interference.None was found - but US-led theoretical concerns about spying still saw Huawei banned from the UK´s 5G networks.Project Clover aims to convince European lawmakers TikTok is safe.But history tells us TikTok´s future will remain in jeopardy unless the US is convinced - and at the moment, the US seems firmly set on taking action against the app.More than 100 million Americans use the viral-video app.But the Canadian and US governments have also restricted its use on official devices.TikTok has said such bans are ""misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security"".And China firmly opposes the action.""How unsure of itself can the world´s top superpower like the US be to fear young people´s favourite app like that?"" China foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.´Diplomatic tensions´The day before Project Clover was announced, US President Joe Biden lent his administration´s support to a bill - promoted by Democrat Mark Warner, who chairs the senate intelligence committee, and Republican John Thune - granting powers to ban foreign-owned technology.TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew will appear before congress later this month.On Tuesday, TikTok told BBC Radio 4´s World Tonight programme it feared becoming a ""pawn"" in diplomatic tensions between the US and China.""It would be hard to deny that we´re caught up in those very broad geopolitics that really have nothing to do with us,"" its US head of public policy Michael Beckerman said.""Almost all the major tech companies also have engineers in China,"" he said, and TikTok was not the only one to gather significant amounts of user data.""And so some of these concerns would extend to all these companies- but that´s why we´re building out the system to ensure that there´s no doubt that data is secure.""Related TopicsTikTokChinaEuropean UnionUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64887704,08,03,2023,bbc,china
Liz Truss calls for Taiwan support to tackle China threat - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersBy Shaimaa Khalil & Stephen McDonellBBC NewsFormer Prime Minister Liz Truss has called for ties with Taiwan to be boosted to combat threats from China, ahead of May´s G7 summit in Hiroshima. In a speech in Tokyo, she urged countries to send a message to Beijing that ""military aggression towards Taiwan would be a strategic mistake"". It was her first public speech since she resigned in October. Her successor Rishi Sunak has said China should be dealt with through ""robust pragmatism"". Ms Truss, who was previously foreign secretary, put forward a number of policy recommendations for countries to support Taiwan, including reducing reliance on China in key industries, deepening economic ties with Taiwan, and accepting the self-ruled island into international organisations. She also called for a more developed Pacific defence alliance so that Taiwan ""is able to defend itself"", and closer cooperation with Nato. She added that ""countries should find a way to elevate Taiwan´s status"". China and Taiwan: A really simple guideGolden era of UK-China relations over, says SunakHer speech was organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international campaign group that focuses on how democratic countries approach China. The Japanese government said this week it would review its defence policy in the wake of the alleged Chinese spy balloon episode in the US. Asked about Ms Truss´s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said: ""I have yet to see the speech. But we are against distorting facts about China.""He added: ""The Taiwan question is China´s domestic affair. Allegations of economic coercion from China are unfounded.""  ´Warnings ignored´ China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually come under its control, while Taiwan views itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders. Chinese President Xi Jinping has said ""reunification"" with Taiwan ""must be fulfilled"", and has not ruled out using force to achieve this aim. Ms Truss said the UK´s previous approach of cultivating a close relationship with Beijing was a mistake, and that the UK had ""ignored too many warning signs"", including the Uyghur detention camps, as well as the ""disgraceful dismantling of one country, two systems in Hong Kong"". ""Since it was the free world which enabled China´s rise, it must be the free world which challenges its economic dominance before it´s too late,"" she said. She said President Xi had ""been very clear"" in his ambition to ""have control of Taiwan"", and called on democratic countries to help protect Taiwan´s status as ""a beacon of freedom in the world"". ""We must learn from the past. We must ensure that Taiwan is able to defend itself, and we must work together across the free world to do this,"" she said. Her successor as prime minister, Mr Sunak, is facing pressure from some of his own MPs to take a tougher line on China. In November, he said the so-called ""golden era"" of relations with China was over and the closer economic ties of the previous decade had been ""naïve"".But he stressed ""we cannot simply ignore China´s significance in world affairs - to global economic stability or issues like climate change"".Related TopicsLiz TrussChinaTaiwan",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64674425,17,02,2023,bbc,china
India v China: Is becoming the most populous country a boon or curse? - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The UN forecasts that India´s population will surpass that of China in mid-AprilBy Soutik BiswasIndia correspondentIn mid-April, India is forecast to surpass China as the world´s most populous country.The Asian giants already have more than 1.4 billion people each, and for over 70 years have accounted for more than a third of the global population. China´s population is likely to begin shrinking next year. Last year, 10.6 million people were born, a little more than the number of deaths, thanks to a rapid drop in fertility rate. India´s fertility rate has also fallen substantially in recent decades - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to two births per woman today - but the rate of decline has been slower. So what does India overtaking China as the most populous country in the world mean? China reduced its population faster than IndiaChina reduced its population growth rate by about half from 2% in 1973 to 1.1% in 1983.Demographers say much of this was achieved by riding roughshod over human rights - two separate campaigns promoting just one child and then later marriages, longer gaps between children and fewer of them - in what was a predominantly rural and overwhelmingly uneducated and poor country,Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Population control measures enjoy some support in IndiaIndia saw rapid population growth - almost 2% annually - for much of the second half of the last century. Over time, death rates fell, life expectancy rose and incomes went up. More people - especially those living in cities - accessed clean drinking water and modern sewerage. ""Yet the birth rate remained high,"" says Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics.India launched a family planning programme in 1952 and laid out a national population policy for the first time only in 1976, around the time China was busy reducing its birth rate. But forced sterilisations of millions of poor people in an overzealous family planning programme during the 1975 Emergency - when civil liberties were suspended - led to a social backlash against family planning. ""Fertility decline would have been faster for India if the Emergency hadn´t happened and if politicians had been more proactive. It also meant that all subsequent governments treaded cautiously when it came to family planning,"" Prof Dyson says. East Asian countries such as Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand, which launched population programmes much later than India, achieved lower fertility levels, cut infant and maternal mortality rates, raised incomes and improved human development earlier than India.Yet India is not undergoing a population explosionIndia has added more than a billion people since Independence in 1947, and its population is expected to grow for another 40 years. But its population growth rate has been declining for decades now, and the country has defied dire predictions about a ""demographic disaster"".So India having more people than China is no longer significant in a ""concerning"" way, say demographers.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, India launched a programme of family planning in 1952Rising incomes and improved access to health and education have helped Indian women have fewer children than before, effectively flattening the growth curve. Fertility rates have dipped below replacement levels - two births per woman - in 17 out of 22 states and federally administered territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a steady population.)The decline in birth rates has been faster in southern India than in the more populous north. ""It is a pity that more of India could not have been like south India,"" says Prof Dyson. ""All things being equal, rapid population growth in parts of north India have depressed living standards"".However, overtaking China could be significant It could, for example, strengthen India´s claim of getting a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, which has five permanent members, including China. India is a founding member of the UN and has always insisted that its claim to a permanent seat is just. ""I think you have certain claims on things [by being the country with largest population],"" says John Wilmoth, director of the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.The way India´s demography is changing is also significant, according to KS James of the Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences. Image source, ReutersImage caption, India´s population is expected to peak between 1.6 and 1.8 billion around 2060Despite drawbacks, India deserves some credit for managing a ""healthy demographic transition"" by using family planning in a democracy which was both poor and largely uneducated, says Mr James. ""Most countries did this after they had achieved higher literacy and living standards."" More good news. One in five people below 25 years in the world is from India and 47% of Indians are below the age of 25. Two-thirds of Indians were born after India liberalised its economy in the early 1990s. This group of young Indians have some unique characteristics, says Shruti Rajagopalan, an economist, in a new paper. ""This generation of young Indians will be the largest consumer and labour source in the knowledge and network goods economy. Indians will be the largest pool of global talent,"" she says. The myth of India´s population explosionIndia´s religious make-up little changed since 1951Why some Indians die younger than othersBut there are challenges tooIndia needs to create enough jobs for its young working age population to reap a demographic dividend. But only 40% of of India´s working-age population works or wants to work, according to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). More women would need jobs as they spend less time in their working age giving birth and looking after children. The picture here is bleaker: only 10% of working-age women were participating in the labour force in October, according to CMIE, compared with 69% in China.Then there´s migration. Some 200 million Indians have migrated within the country - between states and districts - and their numbers are bound to grow. Most are workers who leave villages for cities to find work. ""Our cities will grow as migration increases because of lack of jobs and low wages in villages. Can they provide migrants a reasonable living standard? Otherwise, we will end up with more slums and disease,"" says S Irudaya Rajan, a migration expert at Kerala´s International Institute of Migration and Development.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, More than 10% of Indians are over 60 years oldDemographers say India also needs to stop child marriages, prevent early marriages and properly register births and deaths. A skewed sex ratio at birth - meaning more boys are born than girls - remains a worry. Political rhetoric about ""population control"" appears to be targeted at Muslims, the country´s largest minority when, in reality, ""gaps in childbearing between India´s religious groups are generally much smaller than they used to be"", according to a study from Pew Research Center.And then there´s the ageing of IndiaDemographers say the ageing of India receives little attention.In 1947, India´s median age was 21. A paltry 5% of people were above the age of 60. Today, the median age is over 28, and more than 10% of Indians are over 60 years. Southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu achieved replacement levels at least 20 years ago. ""As the working-age population declines, supporting an older population will become a growing burden on the government´s resources,"" says Rukmini S, author of Whole Numbers and Half Truths: What Data Can and Cannot Tell Us About Modern India. ""Family structures will have to be recast and elderly persons living alone will become an increasing source of concern,"" she says.Read more India stories from the BBC:India beefs up military at tense China borderWHO stands by ´dangerous´ India cough syrup claimThe rape victim’s mum fighting for India’s daughtersIs India seeing a surge in grisly copycat murders?Indian´s search for dad´s lost grave ends in MalaysiaRelated TopicsPopulation growthAsiaChinaAgeing populationIndia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-63957562,20,12,2022,bbc,china
"China Covid: France, Spain, S Korea and Israel tighten rules - BBC News","Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s borders are set to fully reopen on 8 January for the first time in nearly three yearsBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsFrance and Spain have announced Covid testing on visitors from China, following a similar decision in Italy.The French government said passengers flying from China to France would have to present a negative Covid test less than 48 hours old before embarking.Arrivals in Spain can skip the tests if they are fully vaccinated - and Spain does accept some Chinese vaccines.Beijing has said it will fully reopen its borders next week for the first time since March 2020.Its current Covid surge has caused wariness, with reports of hospitals filling up and waves of illness.The UK, South Korea and Israel also announced new testing rules on Friday, while the US and India have already imposed restrictions.UK to need negative Covid test for China arrivals""At the national level, we will implement controls at airports and require travellers from China to present a negative Covid test or be fully vaccinated,"" said Spanish health minister Carolina Darias.Neither France nor Spain have specified when the measures will come into force.However, the French health and transport ministries said the government would publish a decree and notify EU member states.On Thursday, the EU´s disease prevention agency has said such measures were not justified in Europe, because of the levels of immunity and the fact that variants spreading in China were already present on the continent.The World Health Organization, however, has said it was ""understandable"" that some countries had decided to impose restrictions and urged Beijing to be more forthcoming about its Covid numbers.China´s foreign ministry said earlier this week that its ""epidemic situation"" overall was ""predictable and under control"".But the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. Do restrictions on travel work against Covid?South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said that travellers from China would need to have a negative PCR or antigen test before boarding flights to South Korea. They will also need to undergo a PCR test within the first day of their arrival in South Korea.Israel, meanwhile, has ordered foreign airlines not to allow people to travel from China unless they have tested negative - and asked its own citizens to avoid unnecessary travel there. Not all countries have announced controls. Germany has joined Australia, France, and Portugal in saying there will be no new rules yet.However, Germany´s health minister has said the country is seeking a co-ordinated system to monitor variants across European airports.China´s decision this week to reopen its borders on 8 January marks the last stage of the country´s controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed.As the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing maintained an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdown.In November, the frustration spilled on to the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. A week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions.Related TopicsSpainAsiaTravelChinaCoronavirus testingCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64127917,30,12,2022,bbc,china
China seeks 'bold' steps to lift birth rate - BBC News,"Image source, Future PublishingImage caption, China is facing a shrinking population and falling birth rate.By Joel Guinto and Kelly NgBBC NewsA senior health official in Beijing has urged China´s local leaders to find ways to boost the country´s birth rate.Yang Wenzhuang said officials must take active steps to tackle the detrimental effects of China´s long-standing anti-population growth policy.He also urged officials to ""make bold innovations"" in tackling the cost of childcare and education.China reported in January that its population had fallen for the first time in 60 years.In 2022, there was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people in China, the lowest birth rate on record and down from 7.52 births in the previous year.The country´s strict one-child policy - which was implemented from 1980 to 2015 to respond to runaway population growth - has been blamed for the decline. Families that broke the rules were fined and, in some cases, even lost jobs.The limit was increased nationally for married couples to two in 2016, and boosted further to three in 2021. But one province - Sichuan - has adopted even looser rules. Mr Yang - who heads the country´s Population Monitoring and Family Development department - said officials had to ""firmly grasp the important window period of population development"". Speaking to a state-backed health magazine, Mr Yang said concerns about the cost of childcare were having a detrimental impact on population growth. He also identified challenges around money and career goals as causes for the decline. ""Local governments should be encouraged to actively explore and make bold innovations in reducing the cost of childbirth, childcare and education"" to promote the long-term balanced development of the population, Mr Yang said. Should China worry about its shrinking population?Mothers, your country needs you!Some provinces have already begun implementing new measures to try to boost the birth rate, including giving money to sperm donors.In Sichuan, health authorities said they would allow unmarried couples to raise a family and enjoy benefits reserved for married couples. Previously there was a ban on single women registering a birth.Authorities in the region also announced that couples would be allowed to have as many children as they want - a major reversal of the one-child policy. A shrinking population, falling birth rate and the prospect of a fast-aging population poses a long-term challenge to the world´s second largest economy, which only recently dropped ultra-strict Covid-19 curbs.In 2022, the population dropped by 850,000 people to 1.41175 billion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. It was the first decline since 1961, the last year of China´s Great Famine.A surging Indian population also threatens to overtake China and push it down to second place.Related TopicsPopulation growthAsiaChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64594469,10,02,2023,bbc,china

"China should be honest on Covid origin, says US envoy - BBC News","Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicImage source, Getty ImagesBy Max MatzaBBC NewsThe US envoy to China has called on the country to be ""more honest"" about the origins of the Covid-19 virus. His comments come a day after US media reported that a federal agency had found the pandemic probably started from a laboratory leak in Wuhan.The Department of Energy reportedly concluded with ""low confidence"" that the virus was accidentally leaked.China´s foreign ministry hit back, saying Covid´s origin ""was about science and should not be politicised"".Washington-Beijing ties have been under strain since the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon this month.Ambassador Nicholas Burns told a US Chamber of Commerce event on Monday that China needs to ""be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis"".The energy department had formerly said it was undecided on how the virus began.Other US agencies have drawn differing conclusions, with varying degrees of confidence in their findings. The FBI in 2021 concluded with ""moderate confidence"" that the virus leaked from a lab. Other studies suggest it made the leap from animals to humans at Wuhan´s Huanan seafood and wildlife market.Covid origin studies say evidence points to marketAn unclassified report released by the US top spy official in October 2021 said that four US intelligence agencies had assessed with ""low confidence"" that it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus.White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Monday there was still no firm finding either way.""There has not been a definitive conclusion and consensus in the US government on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he told reporters when asked about the energy department´s reported determination.A spokeswoman for China´s foreign ministry on Monday again rejected the lab leak theory.Mao Ning called on US investigators to ""stop smearing China and stop politicising origins-tracing"".After it was reported that the US energy department had settled on the lab leak theory, Republican Senator Tom Cotton tweeted ""being proven right doesn´t matter"". ""What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn´t happen again.""Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton told CNN he was ""not entirely surprised"" by the energy department´s reported conclusion.

China spy balloon: US Navy releases photos of debris - BBC News,"Image source, US Fleet Forces CommandThe US Navy has released photos of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot out of the sky on Saturday.The US Fleet Forces Command posted several photos on its Facebook page showing large debris of the balloon being hauled into a boat.The post said the sailors retrieving the debris on Sunday were part of the Navy´s specialist explosives team.The device will now be examined to see whether it was indeed spy equipment.US officials have described the balloon as being about 200 ft (60m) tall, with the payload portion comparable in size to regional airliners and weighing hundreds - or potentially thousands - of pounds. China has repeatedly insisted that the ""airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident"".On Tuesday, US officials said the Pentagon sought to arrange a phone call between Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart after the balloon was shot down, but was rebuffed by China. ""Lines between our militaries are particularly important in moments like this,"" defence press secretary Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, the PRC has declined our request.""The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off a weekend trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years - over the ""irresponsible act"". Image source, US Fleet Forces CommandThe balloon was retrieved off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a day after being shot down by a fighter jet.The navy said the debris was spread over seven miles (11km) of the Atlantic Ocean, and two naval ships - including one with a heavy crane for recovery - were sent to the area. However, the photos reveal the piles of balloon material were able to be pulled aboard by hand.The US military has also deployed unmanned underwater vehicles as part of the search effort. What can US learn from Chinese balloon debris?Experts say that the wreckage of the balloon could provide the US with valuable insight into Chinese aerial surveillance technology and techniques, allowing them to better understand what the balloon was capable of and how it transmitted information. Efforts to recover the balloon´s equipment, however, have been complicated by the need to ensure that US personnel are kept safe from potentially dangerous materials, such as explosives or battery components. US defence officials first announced they were tracking the strange object on Thursday, and waited until it was safely over water before shooting it down.Footage on US TV networks showed the balloon falling to the sea after a small explosion.On Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.Colombia´s Air Force says an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country´s airspace at above 55,000ft.It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Video appears to show China balloon shot downRelated TopicsSpyingChinaSurveillanceUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64562100,07,02,2023,bbc,china
US-China chip war: ASML says China employee stole data - BBC News,"Image source, ASMLBy Annabelle  LiangBusiness reporterMajor computer chip equipment maker ASML says a former employee in China stole information about its technology.The Dutch firm says it has since reported the breach to authorities in the Netherlands and the US.However, the company added that it does not ""believe that the misappropriation is material to our business.""ASML is one of the most important firms in the global microchip supply chain. It makes machines that produce the world´s most advanced chips.Chips, or semiconductors, which are used to power everything from mobile phones to military hardware, are at the centre of a bitter dispute between the US and China.""We have experienced unauthorised misappropriation of data relating to proprietary technology by a (now) former employee in China,"" ASML said in its latest annual report.""As a result of the security incident, certain export control regulations may have been violated. We are implementing additional remedial measures in light of this incident,"" it added.ASML did not name the former employee or give details on which export control regulations may have been violated.The firm did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.How China sneaks out America´s technology secretsHow the US-China chip war is playing outThis is not the first time that ASML has linked an intellectual property (IP) breach to China.In its 2021 annual report, the firm said it was aware of reports that a Chinese semiconductor equipment and software maker, DongFang JingYuan Electron, ""was actively marketing products in China that could potentially infringe on ASML´s IP rights.""DongFang JingYuan Electron denied the allegations.At the time the Beijing-based company said the reports were ""inconsistent with the facts"".""We reserve the right to take any other legal actions against the relevant false information,"" it added.Major companies in the semiconductor industry have faced controls on exports to China.In October, Washington announced that it would require licences for companies exporting chips to China using US tools or software, no matter where they are made in the world.The US has been pushing the Netherlands and Japan to adopt similar restrictions.Since 2019 the Dutch government has stopped ASML from selling its most advanced lithography machines to China.Lithography machines use lasers to print miniscule patterns on silicon as part of the manufacturing process of microchips.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: How the semiconductor shortage could be a problem for youRelated TopicsCompaniesSemiconductorsChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64658843,16,02,2023,bbc,china
Building giant CRH chooses US over London in blow to UK - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBuilding materials giant CRH is planning to move its main share listing from the UK to the US, in a further blow to the London stock market.The Ireland-based firm said North America now accounted for about three-quarters of its earnings and was likely to be ""a key driver of future growth"".The move is likely to add to concerns that the UK´s stock market is losing out to overseas rivals.Reports suggest UK tech firm Arm may also list its shares in New York.Chip designer Arm used to be a member of the FTSE 100 share index of top UK firms, but was bought by Japanese conglomerate Softbank in 2016.Recently, Softbank has been looking to list Arm´s shares after a planned sale to US firm Nvidia fell through.The UK government has reportedly been lobbying hard for the company to choose the London stock market. However, Bloomberg has reported that Arm is going to reject the UK and aim to list its shares in New York later this year.A number of takeovers of firms listed in London has increased concerns that the UK market is declining in importance, and is failing to attract fast-growing tech firms.CRH announced its plans to change its share listing as it reported strong sales and earnings for the past year.The company - which supplies products such as asphalt, cement and paving - saw sales climb 12% last year to $32.7bn (£27.3bn) with earnings rising 13% to $5.6bn.CRH said moving its main share listing to the US would bring ""increased commercial, operational and acquisition opportunities"" for the firm, and it would now consult its shareholders over the plans.If CRH does decide to switch, it will be following in the footsteps of plumbing and heating product firm Ferguson which moved its main listing to the US last year.Last month, betting firm Flutter said it was thinking of a US share listing, and earlier this week, the Financial Times reported that oil giant Shell - the largest company on the London stock market - had considered moving its shares to the US market in 2021.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said there were plenty of other companies in the FTSE 100 that could follow Ferguson and CRH.

Miley Cyrus achieves UK chart double - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Endless Summer Vacation is the star´s second number one album in the UKBy Mark SavageBBC Music CorrespondentMiley Cyrus has achieved a relatively rare chart feat in the UK - topping both the singles and album chart in the same week.Her eighth studio album Endless Summer Vacation enters the chart in pole position, while her single Flowers spends a ninth week at number one. It´s the star´s first number one album since 2013´s Bangerz.That record also scored the chart double, alongside the multi-platinum-selling single, Wrecking Ball.Flowers, which is said to be about the end of her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth, is now tied with Olivia Rodrigo´s Drivers License as the longest-running number one single by a female solo artist this decade. Last Friday´s release of Endless Summer Vacation (which includes two versions of Flowers) ensured that the song reclaims its title as the most-streamed song of the last seven days, overtaking the viral smash Boy´s A Liar Pt. 2 by PinkPantheress and Ice Spice.Figure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsReviews for the album have been broadly positive, praising Cyrus´s vulnerability and songcraft, while lamenting that some of her rougher edges have been sanded off.""The current of honesty that runs through Endless Summer Vacation encourages the listener to press play on the record again, and the stories here get even better on a second or third listen,"" wrote Consequence Of Sound. ""It´s cohesive without feeling repetitive.""The album ""holds your full attention even if it isn´t Cyrus´s boldest or most visionary,"" said the NME, calling the songs a ""remarkably intriguing"" insight into her post-divorce state of mind.Pitchfork noted that the record is divided into ""AM"" and ""PM"" sections, with the former, written alongside Harry Styles´ collaborator Kid Harpoon, outshining the ""maddening"" and ""grating"" second half.Two of the album´s stand-out tracks, River and Jaded, also make this week´s Top 40.Eurovision featElsewhere, Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding claimed this week´s highest new entry, with their trancey new collaboration Miracle.Figure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsThe song enters the chart at number three, marking becoming Calvin´s 29th and Ellie´s 12th top 10 hit. It´s also their third as a duo, following 2012´s I Need Your Love and 2014´s Outside.Miracle is a strong contender for next week´s number one... but it only gets one shot at the top. Ed Sheeran´s comeback single, Eye´s Closed, is out the following week.Meanwhile, UK Eurovision entrant Mae Muller gets her campaign off to a strong start, as her single I Wrote A Song enters the chart at number 30.That´s already an improvement on last year´s contestant, Sam Ryder, who only cracked the top 40 after taking second place in Turin.Mae Muller announced as UK act for Eurovision 2023Mae Muller: Who is the UK´s Eurovision entrant?In fact, Muller is the first UK act to enter the chart in advance of Eurovision since Blue in 2011. I Wrote A Song is her first Top 40 single as a solo artist. She previously reached number 32 in 2021, as the vocalist on Better Days, a collaboration with producer Neiked and US rapper Polo G.Figure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsMuller was revealed as the UK´s hopeful last week but, speaking to the BBC´s Eurovisioncast podcast, she said she´d been sitting on the secret for a couple of months.""It was hard because I´m a bit of a chatterbox and I´m quite open,"" she said. ""But I did tell my parents because I thought I can´t give them that much of a shock.""Related TopicsMiley CyrusOfficial UK music chartsMusic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64993564,17,03,2023,bbc,uk

Russia Ukraine invasion: Indians are braving war to study in Ukraine - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lviv in western Ukraine is far from the fighting - but there are frequent sirens warning of attacksBy Jugal Purohit BBC Hindi, DelhiRishi Dwivedi is one of thousands of Indian students evacuated from Ukraine a year ago - but he´s now back studying in Lviv, despite the threat the war poses to his safety.""Air raid sirens alerting us about incoming missile or drone attacks go off as many as four times a day,"" Mr Dwivedi, 25, told the BBC.The fifth-year student, from Kannauj in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, is pursuing a bachelor´s degree in medicine and surgery at the Lviv National Medical University. He was rescued when Russia invaded a year ago - but decided to return last October to finish his degree. Image caption, Rishi Dwivedi worries that if the war escalates again he will need to fleeAfter a 22-year-old Indian medical student was killed in shelling at the start of the war, India evacuated 23,000 of its nationals who´d been trapped, including 18,000 students.But large numbers - most of them medics - have since gone back, defying government advice. They say they have little choice if they are to work as doctors.Mr Dwivedi is among 1,100 Indians currently living in Ukraine. Most are students in cities like Lviv, Uzhgorod and Ternopil in the west of the country - within range of Russian air attacks but a long way from fighting in the east.They´re not the only foreigners to return. The BBC met African students who´d gone back to Lviv, and others are considering whether they should too.‘No one’s coming to save us’: Indian students in Kharkiv""We wonder if we´ll be able to finish our course. When helicopters or planes fly over us, we are unable to sleep. We worry if there is going to be an attack,"" says Shrishti Moses, a medical student  in her fourth year in Lviv. Power supply is patchy, so Ms Moses, who´s from the northern Indian city of Dehradun, had to move to a more expensive apartment in a neighbourhood with regular electricity.Image source, EPAImage caption, The scene of a Russian attack in Lviv region last week - five people were killedGiven these conditions, why return to Ukraine?Experts say that most Indian medical students abroad want to return to their country after graduating. But for that, they need permission from the National Medical Commission (NMC), India´s medical education regulator. When the war forced these students out of their education, India´s education minister said the government would ""do everything possible"" to ""make them doctors"". The Indian Medical Association asked for such students to be accommodated in Indian colleges. State governments made similar demands.India students back from Ukraine left in the lurchIndia´s external affairs ministry even asked for ""Indian private medical institutions to enrol returnee students… on a one-time exceptional basis"". But the health ministry ruled otherwise. It said in July that there were no provisions to ""accommodate or transfer medical students from any foreign medical institutes to Indian medical colleges"".Many students who returned from Ukraine aren´t even seeking admission to Indian colleges - because of the fierce competition to gain entry and the high cost of medical courses.Image caption, Vaishali Sethia left Ukraine in March and returned in NovemberVaishali Sethia, who is studying medicine at the Ternopil National Medical University, left Ukraine via the Hungarian border in early March last year and returned in November.""The NMC had issued an order declaring that Indian students who had taken admission in foreign universities after November 2021 would have to finish the course in the same university if they wanted their degrees to be recognised in India,"" says Ms Sethia, who´s from Faridabad just outside Delhi. She said she gained admission in December 2021, just a couple of months before war forced her to leave.""People keep asking us why we returned Ukraine. We had to,"" she says. Indian students stuck in Ukraine desperate for helpLast month, India´s health ministry said 3,964 Indian students who were in Ukrainian universities when the war began, had shifted to universities mostly outside Ukraine. About 170 students have continued studying in Ukrainian universities that have temporarily shifted their operations to safer areas.The health ministry also announced that Indian students who had completed their medical course on or before 30 June 2022, were eligible to sit the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination - an exam for students who´ve graduated abroad and want a licence to practice in India. But all this means little to students who have now returned to Ukraine. Those who haven´t done so find themselves in a strange limbo.Image caption, Dipak Kumar and his mother, who is not in favour of him returning to UkraineDipak Kumar, who lives in India´s northern state of Bihar, says that though he would like to go back to Ukraine and resume his studies, he can´t because of family pressure.""My family opposes the move because they fear for my safety,"" he says.Dipak says he could have secured admission to a private medical college in India, but chose not to because of the high fees.""We did not even have the money required for Ukraine, so my father sold some of our land to pay my fees,"" he says. Students the BBC spoke to say that the fees for the entire medical course in Ukraine works out to be less than half of what it costs to study in a private institution in India.Mrityunjay Kumar, whose son Shashank has now returned to study in Lviv, says that while Indian private colleges charge around 7.2m rupees ($87,000; £72,000) for the course, in Ukraine it costs closer to 2.5m rupees.Back in Lviv, Rishi Dwivedi says he now gets less attention since going back. ""We students were in the limelight for the month that we returned. People then stopped bothering about us.""But every day is filled with uncertainty about the future.""We have told our parents that in case the war escalates again and we need to run, then we are on our own now. We will try and find our way out from nearby border areas,"" he says.Additional reporting by Claire Press & Kevin McGregor BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Albanian migrants: Why are they coming to the UK and how many have arrived? - BBC News,"Image source, PA MediaThe government says its deal with Albania in December has reduced the number of Albanian migrants arriving in small boats.""I´ve also negotiated a new deal with Albania, which accounted for a third of all small boats arrivals, and that´s already delivering,"" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said at a news conference on 7 March.""We´ve returned 500 illegal migrants to Albania and we are seeing far fewer come as a result.""In 2022, more people arrived in small boats from Albania - which Mr Sunak has called a ""safe, prosperous European country"" - than from any other country. How many Albanian migrants come to the UK? There has been a rapid increase in the number of Albanian migrants crossing the English Channel:In 2020, 50 arrived on small boatsIn 2021, 800 made the crossingIn 2022, 12,301 arrived The figure for 2022 accounted for 28% of arrivals in small boats, which is somewhat less than the one third suggested by the prime minister.Many are single, adult men - the numbers represent around 1% of Albania´s working age men, according to figures from Eurostat. ""The rise has been exponential and we think that is in the main due to the fact that Albanian criminal gangs have gained a foothold in the north of France,"" Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O´Mahoney told the Home Affairs Select Committee.Has the number arriving been falling?Of the Albanian migrants who arrived in small boats in 2022, 95% arrived between May and October.The numbers were much lower in November, when 166 arrived and December, when 28 arrived.But that significant fall cannot be entirely due to the cooperation agreement between the UK and Albania because it was not signed until 13 December. No figures for arrivals broken down by nationality have yet been published for 2023. We have asked the Home Office for the figures to support the prime minister´s claim but were told they would not be available until they are published in May.How many Albanians does the UK return? In the 12 months to end of September 2022, a total of 900 Albanians were removed from the UK, with another 469 returning voluntarily. Those are the most recent figures that have been published.Albanians represented the highest number of foreign offenders sent back in the year to September 2022. The Home Office says that since the announcement on 13 December, more than 500 illegal migrants have been returned to Albania, but those figures will not be published until August.More than 500 enforced removals in just under three months would be a lot. We haven´t seen anything close to that for a single quarter since the 461 removals between October and December 2016, although of course there has been an unusually large number of arrivals in the past year.We also know that on 12 January 2023, the UK deported 43 people to Albania - 27 of whom had committed criminal offences according to the Home Office.The cooperation agreement signed with Albania in December:Set up a joint task force to deter and disrupt illegal migrationThe UK agreed to assist with services to support those returning to AlbaniaThe countries will share information to reduce illegal migration and combat human traffickingMr Sunak also announced he wanted to increase the numbers returned to Albania by:Setting up a new unit staffed by 400 specialists to process Albanian cases Raising the threshold someone has to meet to be considered a victim of ""modern slavery""New guidance for case workers that Albania is a ""safe country""Sending UK border officials to the airport in Tirana, the capital of AlbaniaImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Migrants crossing the Channel on small boats brought ashore at DoverHow many Albanian migrants are granted asylum? In 2022, 85% of Albanians who arrived by small boats submitted asylum applications.Only 68 of them (0.7%) have received an initial decision and none were granted refugee status or another type of leave to remain.In general, 53% of claims by Albanians are accepted. Most are by women and children. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has said some Albanian migrants falsely claim to be victims of trafficking, using standard letters to apply for help. In 2022, 13% of Albanians - 1,719 people - who arrived in small boats were referred to the National Referral Mechanism for modern slavery. That´s a higher number than for any other country. Other Albanian migrants disappear and work illegally in the UK, before returning home, according to Mr O´Mahoney.Albanians can apply to enter the UK with a visa for tourism, business or study.In 2022, the UK received 31,965 visitor visa applications from Albanian citizens and granted 22,359 of them, according to Home Office figures.How does the UK compare with the rest of Europe?In the first nine months of 2022, France processed more asylum applications from Albanians than the UK but rejected most of them. Germany and Greece were next, followed by the UK, which granted asylum at a significantly higher rate than the others except for the Republic of Ireland.One migration expert pointed out that some countries have been faster at making asylum decisions than the UK, pointing out: ""in Q3 [July to September 2022] this year, France made over 31,000 initial decisions. That´s the same total as the last 7 quarters in the UK.""EU countries appear to have been finding it difficult to return unsuccessful asylum-seekers to their countries of origin, although there are no comparable statistics for this. What makes migrants leave Albania?On 7 December 2022, Qirjako Qirko - the Albanian ambassador to the UK - told MPs that some Albanian migrants come to the UK to seek out business opportunities. He also claimed that some ""pretended"" to be victims of modern slavery.Speaking before the same committee, Balkans expert Andi Hoxhaj estimated that around 40% of people leave Albania for ""economic opportunities"".Three decades after the collapse of Enver Hoxha´s dictatorship and the opening of Albania´s borders, about 60% of the country´s adult population wanted to leave, according to a Gallup poll published in December 2018.They cited corruption, low salaries, poor working conditions and a low quality of life as their main reasons.Related TopicsAlbaniaMigrationTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished41 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Hong Kong 47: UK MPs call for release of ex-lawmaker Claudia Mo - BBC News,"Related TopicsHong Kong anti-government protestsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Former Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo has been detained since 2021By Nicholas YongBBC NewsA group of 54 British MPs and public figures have called for the release of a former Hong Kong lawmaker so she can visit her critically-ill husband.Claudia Mo, 66, has been in detention since being arrested in 2021 under a controversial national security law.Her husband, British journalist Philip Bowring, has pneumonia and is in a Hong Kong intensive care ward.The group has urged the UK Foreign Secretary to raise the family´s case with Hong Kong authorities.""Considering Philip´s deteriorating medical condition, we urge you to intercede on Claudia Mo´s behalf with the Hong Kong government... so she can be with her husband,"" read the letter, sent on 24 February.It also argued the UK´s foreign office bore a ""special responsibility"" for Ms Mo´s welfare as her husband and two children are UK citizens. Ms Mo had previously also held British citizenship which she gave up after becoming a member of Hong Kong´s parliament, the Legislative Council.The former lawmaker is one of the so-called Hong Kong 47 group-  who are on trial for alleged ""subversion"". She was one of the dozens in the pro-democracy parties arrested for organising and holding an unofficial primary vote in 2020.The group includes some of the city´s most prominent pro-democracy figures, such as student activist Joshua Wong and law professor Benny Tai. Most of them have been detained the past two years on security grounds.The rights group that organised the letter, the UK-based Hong Kong Watch, told the BBC they had received no response yet from Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.Signatories include Hong Kong´s last British governor Chris Patten, former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Conservative Party´s 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady and former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. It urges the UK government to press Hong Kong authorities and secure the release of the Hong Kong 47 opposition lawmakers and activists.The letter also notes that many of the 47 charged possess British National Overseas (BNO) status, which under a special visa scheme enables Hong Kong residents to come to the UK for up to five years and apply for permanent residency.The trial of the Hong Kong 47 is currently ongoing - but 31 people including Ms Mo, Mr Wong and Mr Tai have already pleaded guilty and will be sentenced after the trial.Critics say the national security law is being used as a tool to crush civil dissent, but Chinese and Hong Kong authorities maintain it is needed to curb unrest.Related TopicsHong Kong anti-government protestsChinaHong Kong",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64807507,03,03,2023,bbc,uk
Poland to send four fighter jets to Ukraine 'in coming days' - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, EPAImage caption, A Polish Air Force Mig 29 fighter during a flight in February 2023By Adam Easton in Warsaw & Thomas Mackintosh in LondonBBC NewsPoland will send four Soviet-era Mig fighter jets to Ukraine - becoming the first Nato country to send planes since Russia invaded last year.Polish President Andrzej Duda said they would be sent in the coming days, with others handed over in the future.Though a welcome boost to Ukraine´s air defence, the extra jets are not expected to be decisive in the war.The deputy speaker of Ukraine´s parliament Olena Kondratyuk said she hoped more countries would follow.Other Nato countries are considering sending the Soviet-era planes, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.Ukraine has previously asked Western countries for modern fighter jets, such as the F-16.The UK is training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard aircraft. But because of the long training times, it has warned that supplying Western jets would only ever be a long-term option.President Biden has previously ruled out sending jets from the US to Ukraine.What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?At the start of Russia´s full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have around 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing Mig-29s and Su-27s.President Duda said Poland still had around a dozen Soviet-era Mig 29 aircraft in operation.Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik told the BBC: ""We need them to strengthen our air defence systems and to help our army in the spring counter-offensive. ""It´s also a good sign to everybody that getting fighter jets to Ukraine is not something unspeakable or surreal - that this is something that can happen; that the only thing that is needed to make it happen is political will.""Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister, told the BBC the Polish jets would be used ""very efficiently by our air force"".He said in the past 24 hours, the existing Ukrainian air force had carried out 16 air strikes on Russian personnel and equipment. But he stressed that Ukraine wanted ""fourth generation"" jets, such as F-16s.""They are more universal platforms, they are more capable and of course they will make Ukrainian air forces more efficient,"" he said.Poland is a strong ally of Ukraine one of the largest suppliers of military equipment. It is currently replacing its old Soviet-era planes with newer American and Korean models.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warAndrzej DudaUkrainePoland",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64975770,16,03,2023,bbc,uk

Deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia is war crime - UN - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, Over 16,000 children are thought to have been transferred to Russia or Russia-controlled areas.By Laura GozziBBC NewsRussia´s forced deportation of Ukrainian children to areas under its control amounts to a war crime, UN investigators have said.The UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine said there was evidence of the illegal transfer of hundreds of Ukrainian children to Russia.The Commission´s report is categorical that Russia also committed other war crimes in Ukraine. They include attacks on hospitals, torture, rape and wilful killings.Ukraine government figures put the number of children forcibly taken to Russia at 16,221.Russia has introduced policies such as the granting of Russian citizenship and the placement of children in foster families to ""create a framework in which some of the children may end up remaining permanently"" in Russia, the report notes.While the transfers were supposed to be temporary ""most became prolonged"", with both parents and children facing ""an array of obstacles in establishing contact"", UN investigators wrote. In some cases, parents or children told the Commission that once in Russia-controlled areas, transferred children were made to wear ""dirty clothes, were screamed at, and called names."" They also said that ""some children with disabilities did not receive adequate care and medication.""The burden of contacting their parents fell primarily to the transferred children as the adults faced ""considerable logistical, financial, and security challenges"" in finding or retrieving their children, the report says.It also quotes witnesses as saying that the smaller children transferred may have not been able to establish contact with their families and might, as a consequence, ""lose contact with them indefinitely"".The forced deportations of Ukrainian children ""violate international humanitarian law, and amount to a war crime"", concludes the report.The UN said that in addition to the rapes, killings and ""widespread"" torture, Moscow could be responsible for the even more serious ""crimes against humanity"" - notably the wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine´s energy infrastructure that began last October. The commission is also trying to determine whether the bombing and siege of the city of Mariupol last May might constitute a crime against humanity.The investigators said they had also documented ""a small number"" of violations committed by Ukrainian armed forces.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUnited Nations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64985009,16,03,2023,bbc,uk

Snow and travel delays expected as Arctic blast hits UK - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A row of snow-covered houses in Aberbeeg, Wales on WednesdayBy Michael Sheils McNameeBBC NewsForecasters have warned of heavy snow and travel disruption as a wave of Arctic air brings icy conditions to central and northern England. An amber warning affecting an area between Stoke-on-Trent and Durham is set to come into force at 15:00 GMT on Thursday. The warning indicates a likelihood of travel delays, power cuts, and that some rural communities will be cut off. It comes after the UK recorded its coldest March temperature since 2010.The area affected by the amber warning includes the Peak District, Leeds, the Yorkshire Dales, and the North Pennines. The Met Office said around 10-20cm (4-8in) of snow is likely to fall across much of the area, with 30-40cm (12-16in) in some parts, and to be accompanied by ""strong winds bringing blizzard conditions"".The amber warning is not set to be lifted until midday on Friday. Less severe yellow weather warnings for snow and ice remain in place for much of the rest of the UK. These mean journey times are likely to be longer and icy patches on untreated roads and pavements are expected. National Highways in England has issued a severe weather alert for snow in the North West, North East and Midlands between 09:00 GMT on Thursday and 08:00 GMT on Friday.

Ukraine will remember who backed us - foreign minister - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage caption, Ukraine´s foreign minister spoke of his disappointment that the Pope is yet to visit UkraineBy James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent in KyivCountries that ""mistreated Ukraine"" will be held to account after the war ends, Ukraine´s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has warned.In a BBC interview he said the choice every nation made following Russia´s full-scale invasion will be ""taken into account in building future relations"".He also warned delays of Western weapon deliveries would cost Ukrainian lives.""If one delivery is postponed for one day, it means that someone is going to die on the frontline,"" he said. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Kuleba also discussed how he believes the war will end, the role of China in the war, and his disappointment that Pope Francis has yet to visit his country in war time.Mr Kuleba spoke to the BBC in Ukraine´s imposing, Soviet-era foreign ministry at the heart of Kyiv, now protected by sandbags and armed guards.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Western nations have shown strong unity in backing Ukraine so farAlthough Ukraine has received military and economic support from Western powers since Russia´s invasion, many countries in Africa, Asia and South America have stayed on the sidelines. Some are historically sympathetic to Russia, some are concerned about the economic costs of the war, and others believe the West is prolonging the fighting unnecessarily. But Mr Kuleba made clear that countries which failed to support Ukraine now - those, he said, which had ""misbehaved in the course of this war and mistreated Ukraine"", would pay a price in the future. Ukraine may well be dependent on Western aid and military support in the medium to long term and so its diplomatic disapproval may not worry some countries. But in peacetime Ukraine´s huge grain exports give it substantial economic leverage, particularly in parts of the developing world. ""If anyone in the world thinks that the way this or that country behaved - or treated Ukraine at the darkest moment of its history - will not be taken into account in building future relations, these people just don´t know how diplomacy works,"" he said.""War is a time when you have to make a choice. And every choice has been recorded.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ukraine is using vast amounts of shells and ammunition to defend itself - and needs even moreMr Kuleba said Western allies were not giving Ukraine military support fast enough because they had not been ready for a conflict on the same scale as World War One. And what he needed was artillery shells. ""We want partners to act faster,"" he said. ""And if one delivery is postponed for one day, it means that someone is going to die on the front line. ""It means that someone who could have been still alive is going to die.""Nowhere has the demand for ammunition been greater than in the eastern city of Bakhmut where Ukrainian forces have been holding out for more than seven months against repeated Russian attempts to seize the city. This, Mr Kuleba said, was ""emotionally very challenging"" because of the losses suffered. But if Bakhmut fell, then other cities would be next: ""So in order to save lives there… we have to fight in Bakhmut as long as we physically can.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Russia has lost many troops battling for Bakhmut, but Ukraine has also suffered high casualties defending itThere was no sign, he said, of Russia being willing to negotiate an end to the fighting but he added: ""Every war ends at the negotiating table... But my goal as a foreign minister is to make sure that Ukraine reaches the table after a defining success on the battlefield.""And that involves building the strongest possible coalition of support, an alliance that he feels does not include the Pope. Mr Kuleba said it was not for him but for God to judge the Holy Father but, he said: ""We deeply regret that the Pope has not found an opportunity to visit Ukraine since the beginning of the war.""China, too, has thus far resisted Ukraine´s lobbying for a meeting between China´s President Xi Jinping and Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky, even though Beijing confirmed on Friday that China´s leader is to visit Moscow next week.Mr Kuleba said his president was ready for a telephone conversation with Mr Xi and added: ""I don´t think China has reached the moment now… when it´s ready to arm Russia.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The West worries China may start sending weaponry to RussiaAs for the United States, some analysts have speculated support for Ukraine might reduce after next year´s presidential elections. But Mr Kuleba said: ""I think we can survive any Republican voice"", and insisted ""the biggest luxury that Ukraine enjoys in the United States is the bipartisan support in both Democratic and Republican camps"".As his country´s top diplomat, Dmytro Kuleba remains quietly confident Ukraine can maintain the backing of the allies that count: the ones which provide tangible support. And, he says, Ukraine has one crucial factor on its side: ""Historically, Ukraine was unfairly under-appreciated, and I regret it took a bloodshed and a devastating war for the world to realise how cool we are. ""And we will always be cool. But it just took you too much time to realise that.""Related TopicsUkrainian governmentRussia-Ukraine warVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64976079,17,03,2023,bbc,uk

It takes place after a period of mourning for the previous sovereign.  Elizabeth II became Queen on 6 February 1952 on the death of her father King George VI, but was not crowned until 2 June 1953. Image source, PA MediaImage caption, The Queen was the 39th sovereign to be crowned at Westminster AbbeyKing Charles III´s coronation will take place on Saturday 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey in London. He will be the 40th monarch to be invested there. During the ceremony, the King will be crowned alongside Camilla, the Queen Consort. The occasion will be marked by an additional bank holiday across the UK on Monday 8 May 2023.The coronation is an Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The monarch is anointed with ""holy oil"", and receives the orb and sceptre, symbols of royalty. At the climax of the ceremony, the Archbishop will place St Edward´s Crown on Charles´s head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661.This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation itself. Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and ultimately decides the guest list.Queen Elizabeth´s coronation was the first to be broadcast live on TV, and was watched by more than 20 million people.

As Queen Elizabeth´s firstborn child, Charles became King on his mother´s death and his wife, Camilla, became Queen Consort. King Charles´s heir is his elder son, Prince William. Prince William´s eldest child Prince George is second in line to the throne, and his daughter Princess Charlotte is third. Prince Louis is fourth and Prince Harry is fifth. Royal Family tree and line of succession Where do the Royal Family live?King Charles and the Queen Consort Camilla live in Buckingham Palace. They previously split their time between Clarence House in London and Highgrove in Gloucestershire.Other Royal residences include Windsor Castle, Sandringham in Norfolk, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, and Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire. In August 2022, the Prince and Princess of Wales moved from Kensington Palace in west London to live in Adelaide Cottage, on the Windsor Estate.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, The Prince and Princess of Wales with their children on their first day at Lambrook School in Berkshire.Related TopicsPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince LouisUK Royal FamilyCoronation of King Charles IIIPrince GeorgeMeghan, Duchess of SussexPrince Harry, Duke of SussexUK ParliamentPrince William, Prince of WalesQueen Elizabeth IIPlatinum Jubilee of Elizabeth IIPrincess CharlotteCatherine, Princess of WalesRelated Internet LinksThe Royal FamilyThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished40 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Ukraine war: How ballroom dancing helped children settle in UK - BBC News,"Image source, Katerina DrozhzhynaImage caption, Yeva Drozhzhyna and Zakhar Postupailo moved from near Kyiv to Castleford, West YorkshireBy Julia Bryson & Abi JaiyeolaBBC NewsA Ukrainian family who live with MP Yvette Cooper and her husband Ed Balls have revealed how a love of ballroom dancing helped them settle in the UK.Yeva Drozhzhyna, 12, and her mother Katerina came from near Kyiv to Castleford, West Yorkshire, where their sponsor Ms Cooper is the Labour MP.Mrs Drozhzhyna said dancing helped Yeva keep some normality in her life.Ms Cooper said Mr Balls - who appeared on BBC show Strictly Come Dancing, had been ""offering a few tips"" of his own.""She really hasn´t been convinced!"" she added.Yeva´s friend Zakhar Postupailo, 10, also relocated to Yorkshire and lives round the corner with his mother Yana.Image source, PAImage caption, Ed Balls and Katya Jones were contestants in the BBC show Strictly Come DancingImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Yvette Cooper is Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and CastlefordThe pair, who have been dance partners since 2017, now practise together regularly and have performed in Blackpool at the Tower Ballroom, which Mrs Drozhzhyna said had always been their dream.""Before the war we planned to compete in Blackpool, it was a goal that we planned to do, and that is why maybe we chose to relocate to the UK as Blackpool is here and it is the centre of ballroom dancing. ""Back home they would usually have lessons every day, but when we first relocated to Hungary and we couldn´t practise, it was stressful for everybody, especially for kids. ""Dancing kept them in a normal life and was an important connection with their past.""Zakhar said ballroom dancing was a big part of his life.""For some people it is a hobby, but for me it is a part of my life so it makes me fun, and more energetic,"" he said.Image caption, Katerina, Yeva´s mother, said performing in Blackpool was a dream come trueMs Cooper said she met Katerina and Yeva after a meeting with a Ukrainian dancer at a fundraising event - the Rob Burrow Strictly Ball - led her to sponsoring the pair and welcoming them into her home. She said: ""It is great having them stay with us, but it´s so awful that they are separated from their families as a result of the illegal war.""It´s amazing watching the dancing, it is so incredible, it´s so important to be able to keep going with something that is a normal part of their lives.

Turkey earthquake: UK team to assess building damage - BBC News,"Related TopicsTurkey–Syria earthquakes 2023Image source, ReutersImage caption, The team will be trying to understand why some buildings survived but others collapsedBy Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis  BBC News Climate and Science Structural and civil engineers from the UK have travelled to Turkey to help to investigate the damage caused by last month´s powerful earthquake.They are collecting geological data and carrying out detailed assessments of why so many buildings collapsed.Work with their Turkish colleagues has revealed examples of poor construction, including large pebbles mixed in concrete, which weakens its strength.But the sheer power of the quake also caused some of the devastation.The ground movement was so great in some areas that it exceeded what buildings had been designed to withstand.Turkey is also carrying out its own extensive investigations into the quake. Image source, Tugce Tetik/EEFITImage caption, Samples from fallen buildings show that large pebbles have been mixed into concreteThe research is being carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT).The group includes experts from industry as well as leading academics and has carried out assessments of major earthquakes over the last three decades. They will combine their findings with research being carried out by Turkish teams and other structural engineers with the aim of learning lessons from the earthquake and finding ways to improve the construction of buildings to make them more resilient.""It´s important to get the full picture rather than just looking at a snapshot of a single asset or a single building,"" explains Professor Emily So, director of the Cambridge University Centre for Risk in the Built Environment, who is co-leader of the investigation. ""The successes of the buildings that are still intact and perform perfectly well are as important as the neighbouring buildings that have collapsed. ""And actually having that distribution, having that overview, is really key to what we can learn from this earthquake.""Image source, BBC/Tony JolliffeImage caption, Emily So (pictured) is leading the EEFIT investigation with Yasemin Didem Aktas from UCLThe Magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck on 6 February in southern Turkey close to the Syrian border and was followed by powerful aftershocks.More than 50,000 people lost their lives in the region as buildings collapsed.In the wake of the devastation, there has been scrutiny of building regulations and construction practices in Turkey. Now the EEFIT team is carrying out technical evaluations of the performance of buildings in the area.Structural engineers from Turkey, who are working with the team, have already found some problems.Samples of concrete taken from a collapsed building in Adiyaman have revealed that it contains 6cm-long stones. They have come from a nearby river and have been used to bulk out the concrete.""That has some serious implications on the strength of the concrete,"" says Prof So.Image source, Tugce Tetik/EEFITImage caption, Steel reinforcements were smooth not ridged, which weakens the concreteAnd steel bars inside the concrete, which should reinforce it, have been found to be smooth instead of ridged. This means the concrete doesn´t cling to them, again weakening the structure.In Turkey, many older buildings collapsed during the quake, but some modern ones also failed. New building codes were brought in after a major earthquake in Iznit in 1999, and Prof So says newer buildings should have fared better. ""I think it´s really important that we recognise those and actually do the testing, to find out why these new buildings, which would have been built to code, have failed in such a way,"" she told BBC News.Image source, Tugce Tetik/EEFITImage caption, A process called liquefaction can make buildings topple overThe EEFIT team is also analysing the nature of the quake.Dr Yasemin Didem Aktas, co-leader of the expedition, from UCL in London, said that the earthquake was extremely powerful.""Even the aftershocks were as large in magnitude as a decent-sized earthquake,"" she said. The quake also caused major ground shifts.""In an earthquake, the ground shakes in a horizontal and vertical fashion. Often the vertical component is much lower and negligible compared to the horizontal movement. However, this event recorded very high vertical accelerations as well.""Some areas saw a process called liquefaction. It turns the solid ground into a heavy fluid - like very wet sand - a tell-tale sign of this is a building that has toppled over or has sunk.""I think the characteristics of the events also played a very important role in the devastation that we are seeing,"" Dr Aktas added.Image source, Tony Jolliffe/BBCImage caption, Ziggy Lubkowski tells the BBC how buildings can be constructed to withstand earthquakesBut buildings can be designed to be earthquake resilient.Ziggy Lubkowski, who leads the seismic team at design and engineering company Arup, which has sent engineers to Turkey for the investigation, said: ""What we try and do when we design buildings is to prevent life loss.""The basic design principle is to allow some form of damage within the building. That damage absorbs the energy of the earthquake, and ensures that the building still stays upright, but doesn´t collapse.""Components such as dampers, which act like shock absorbers as the building sways to and fro, and rubber bearings, which are fitted underneath a building and absorb the energy of a quake, can be added.But all of this costs money.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Rebuilding in the area will cost more than $100bn the UN says""Those increases, in terms of the structural cost of the building, may be in the order of 10 to 15%, depending on the nature of the building,"" Ziggy Lubkowski says. ""But actually, if you think about it, the fit-out costs of a building often outweigh the structural costs of a building. So at the end of the day, the additional structural costs are not that much more.""The United Nations has estimated that the cost of clearing and rebuilding in the earthquake in Turkey could exceed $100 billion. The EEFIT team says the findings, which will be published in the coming weeks, could help in setting new building codes to stop the devastation caused by this earthquake from happening again,Follow Rebecca on Twitter.Related TopicsTurkey–Syria earthquakes 2023Engineering",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64920236,14,03,2023,bbc,uk

London's counter-terror Prevent referrals buck UK trend - meeting - BBC News,"Image source, Metropolitan PoliceImage caption, Ali Harbi Ali, who murdered Sir David Amess MP in 2021, engaged with Prevent between 2014 and 2015By Jess Warren BBC NewsMost of London´s anti-terrorism referrals are for ""Islamist activity"", bucking a national trend, London´s Police and Crime Committee has heard.Latest figures from Prevent show there were more than three times the number of referrals compared to right-wing extremism, the meeting heard.London Assembly members were putting questions to the Met Police and the Mayor´s Office for Policing And Crime. Met Police Commander Dom Murphy said: ""Our focus is where the threat exists.""Prevent is a key part of the UK´s counter-terrorism strategy and places public bodies, including schools and the police, under a legal duty to identify people who may turn to extremism, and intervene in their lives before it is too late.But in a recent highly critical independent review, Prevent was said to have ""apparently failed"" repeatedly to identify attackers.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, London Assembly´s Police and Crime Committee discussed the Prevent review with members of the the Met Police and the Mayor´s Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC)The report from the Home Office´s hand-picked reviewer, William Shawcross, said that while eight out of 10 plot investigations were linked to Islamist causes, less than a fifth of Prevent´s caseload was in the same area. Too often, he argued, there was ""a culture of timidity"" when it came to tackling Islamism.The committee was discussing the review with the Met Police and the Mayor´s Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC).Kenny Bowie, director of strategy at MOPAC, told the meeting the data for the capital did not reflect the national picture.""The latest figures that we have for this show that there were over three times as many Prevent referrals in London related to Islamist activity than there were I think for extreme right wing [views].Image caption, There are more referrals for Islamist ideology in London than right-wing extremism, Kenny Bowie, director of strategy at MOPAC, says""It was 384 against 122, so that would suggest that they are going, and they should go, where the threat is.""Oliver Levinson, head of the Countering Violent Extremism programme at MOPAC, told the committee Prevent had delivered ""good work"" but was not ""without its shortcomings and failures"".He said of the 34 recommendations in the review, which the government had accepted, MOPAC agreed with some and not others.He called for more to be done to raise awareness of the Prevent strategy, the signs of radicalisation, and what help and support could look like.Why the government Prevent scheme is so difficultImam criticised in anti-terror report denies claimsPrevent counter-terror scheme lambasted in reviewCommander Murphy told the committee meeting it was difficult to take a national view on Prevent when it had ""very local implications"".""We don´t recognise in London that we have removed our focus from Islamist ideology.

BBC 'speaking frankly' with Gary Lineker over tweet comparing UK asylum policy to 1930s Germany - BBC News,"Image source, AFPBy Jemma Crew & Katie RazzallBBC NewsThe BBC says it is having a ""frank conversation"" with Gary Lineker after the Match of the Day host tweeted critically about the government´s asylum policy.Lineker said the language in which the plan was set out was ""not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s"".The BBC has impartiality guidelines and the corporation said Lineker was being ""spoken to"" about his responsibilities.Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she was ""disappointed"" by the comments.On Tuesday, the government outlined its plans to effectively ban anyone arriving via an illegal route from claiming asylum in the UK.Anyone found to have entered the country illegally will also be blocked from returning or claiming British citizenship in future.  The measure is part of attempts to address an increase in the number of people arriving in the UK via Channel crossings each year, which rose from around 300 in 2018 to more than 45,000 in 2022. Responding to a video message setting out the policy by Ms Braverman, Lineker tweeted: ""Good heavens, this is beyond awful.""Told by another user he was ""out of order"", he added: ""We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. ""This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I´m out of order?""It is not clear which language in particular Lineker was referring to, but Ms Braverman´s video and accompanying tweet included the words ""enough is enough"" and ""we must stop the boats"". This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Suella Braverman says she is ""disappointed"" by Gary Lineker´s tweetFollowing the comments, the home secretary told BBC One´s Breakfast: ""I´m disappointed, obviously. I think it´s unhelpful to compare our measures, which are lawful, proportionate and - indeed - compassionate, to 1930s Germany. I also think that we are on the side of the British people here.""The decade saw the rise to power of the Nazi party in Germany and persecution of Jewish people, leading to the Second World War.Gary Lineker row: What can BBC presenters say and not say?Why the row over the Migration Bill is just beginningAnalysis: Will this bill become reality?How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Lineker, who has presented Match of the Day since 1999, is the BBC´s highest paid star, having earned about £1.35m in 2020-21.He has in the past been vocal about migrants´ rights and has taken refugees into his home. He has also been critical of successive Conservative governments over issues including Brexit. In October, the BBC´s complaints unit found Lineker had broken impartiality rules in a tweet asking whether the Conservative Party planned to ""hand back their donations from Russian donors"".The comment came after the then Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged Premier League teams to boycott the Champions League final in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. In 2018, after BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew called on him to ""keep your political views... to yourself"", Lineker responded: ""I´m the face of my own Twitter account. I´ll continue to tweet what I like and if folk disagree with me then so be it.""The furore surrounding Lineker´s latest remarks put pressure on the BBC, with director general Tim Davie having made impartiality a cornerstone of his leadership.The broadcaster´s editorial guidelines state that the organisation is ""committed to achieving due impartiality in all its output"" and that ""public comments, for example on social media, of staff [or] presenters... can affect perceptions of the BBC´s impartiality"".Mr Davie said he had not spoken to Lineker.Asked about how many ""strikes"" the presenter has had over social media posts, he said: ""I wouldn´t talk specifically about individuals, I don´t think it´s right. ""I think the BBC absolutely puts the highest value on impartiality and that´s clearly important to us.""What will the new law mean?People removed from the UK will be blocked from returning or seeking British citizenship in futureMigrants will not get bail or be able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detentionThere will be a cap on the number of refugees the UK will settle through ""safe and legal routes"" - set annually by ParliamentA duty on the home secretary to detain those arriving in the UK illegally and remove them to Rwanda or a ""safe"" third country - this will take legal precedence over someone´s right to claim asylumUnder-18s, those medically unfit to fly, or those at risk of serious harm in the country they are being removed to will be able to delay removalAny other asylum claims will be heard remotely after removalConservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said Lineker was ""out of touch"" and should stick to football.Writing on Twitter following Lineker´s comments on Tuesday, he said the presenter had ""piped up again with his virtue-signalling nonsense"".""This is just another example of how out of touch these overpaid stars are with the voting public,"" he said. ""Instead of lecturing, Mr Lineker should stick to reading out the football scores and flogging crisps.""Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay said Lineker´s comments were ""foul, ill-conceived and disgraceful"" and called on the BBC to sack him. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Radio 4´s Today programme she did not agree with the comment, adding it is ""entirely"" a matter for the BBC when asked whether it should take significant action against him.She continued: ""He´s somebody that´s spoken out very strongly on lots of different issues, and people who feel strongly should be able to speak out and say the things that they feel.""A spokesperson for the corporation said: ""The BBC has social media guidance, which is published. Individuals who work for us are aware of their responsibilities relating to social media. We have appropriate internal processes in place if required.""We would expect Gary to be spoken to and reminded of his responsibilities.""The corporation has also responded to previous criticism of Lineker by highlighting that he is not involved in its news or political output and is a freelance broadcaster, not a member of staff.

Shamima Begum bid to regain UK citizenship rejected - BBC News,"Related TopicsShamima Begum caseImage caption, Ms Begum was 15 when she joined the self-styled Islamic State group in 2015By Dominic Casciani and Sean SeddonBBC NewsShamima Begum has lost her challenge over the decision to deprive her of British citizenship despite a ""credible"" case she was trafficked. Mr Justice Jay told the semi-secret court dealing with her case that her appeal had been fully dismissed. The ruling means the 23-year-old remains barred from returning to the UK and stuck in a camp in northern Syria. Her legal team said the case was ""nowhere near over"" and the decision will be challenged.Ms Begum was 15 years old when she travelled to join the self-styled Islamic State group in 2015. She went on to have three children, all of whom have died, after marrying a fighter with the group.  How can you lose your citizenship?In 2019, the then home secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of her British citizenship, preventing her coming home, and leaving her detained as an IS supporter in a camp. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission has ruled that decision, taken after ministers received national security advice about Ms Begum´s threat to the UK, had been lawful - even though her lawyers had presented strong arguments she was a victim. The Shamima Begum StoryThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ""I´m ashamed of myself"" - Shamima Begum (speaking in June 2022)Listen to The Shamima Begum Story investigative podcast on BBC Sounds and watch the film on BBC iPlayer. During the appeal hearing last November, Ms Begum´s lawyers argued the decision had been unlawful because the home secretary had failed to consider whether she had been a victim of child trafficking - in effect arguing she had been groomed and tricked into joining the fighters, along with school friends Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase in February 2015. Ms Sultana was reportedly killed in a bombing raid in 2016, but the fate of Amira Abase is unknown.As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria, it is extremely difficult for the government to confirm the whereabouts of the British nationals. That was the first time judges had to consider whether the state´s obligations to combat trafficking and abuse of children should have any influence over national security decisions.Mr Justice Jay revealed the complexity of the case had caused the panel of three ""great concern and difficulty"". ""The commission concluded that there was a credible suspicion that Ms Begum had been trafficked to Syria,"" he said in his summary.""The motive for bringing her to Syria was sexual exploitation to which, as a child, she could not give a valid consent. ""The commission also concluded that there were arguable breaches of duty on the part of various state bodies in permitting Ms Begum to leave the country as she did and eventually cross the border from Turkey into Syria.""But despite those concerns, the judge said even if Ms Begum had been trafficked, that did not trump the home secretary´s legal duty to make a national security decision to strip her of her British nationality.""There is some merit in the argument that those advising the secretary of state see this as a black and white issue, when many would say that there are shades of grey,"" said the judge in his summary. Previous legal failuresBut despite those questions over how the case had been handled, the commission concluded the home secretary had still acted within his powers - even if there could have been a different outcome. ""If asked to evaluate all the circumstances of Ms Begum´s case, reasonable people with knowledge of all the relevant evidence will differ, in particular in relation to the issue of the extent to which her travel to Syria was voluntary and the weight to be given to that factor in the context of all others,"" said the judge. ""Likewise, reasonable people will differ as to the threat she posed in February 2019 to the national security of the United Kingdom, and as to how that threat should be balanced against all countervailing considerations. ""However, under our constitutional settlement these sensitive issues are for the secretary of state to evaluate and not for the commission."" This isn´t the first time a legal challenge by Ms Begum´s lawyers has failed. In February 2020 the same commission rejected her team´s argument that she had been made ""de facto stateless"" when her citizenship was removed.It agreed with the Home Office´s position that since she was technically entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship, it wasn´t legally obliged to allow her to keep her UK rights.In February 2021, the Supreme Court said she could not return to the UK to fight her case on security grounds.Unlike the UK, other western countries like France, Germany and Australia have allowed an increasing number of former IS supporters back.All US citizens who travelled to Syria to join the self-styled Islamic State group have been allowed to return to the country, barrister Jonathan Hall KC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the BBC.He said the pace of repatriations ""seems to be increasing"", with Germany allowing 100 citizens back, France allowing more than 100, and Sweden also allowing citizens to return in double figures.Canada to take back 23 citizens from IS camps He told BBC News: ""Little by little, countries are beginning to change their posture from [a] strategic distance to try and manage their return.""There is a bit of a risk that the UK could become a bit of an outlier.""´Troubling findings´In a statement, Ms Begum´s lawyers Gareth Pierce and Daniel Furner called on Suella Braverman, the current home secretary, to look at the case again ""in light of the commission´s troubling findings"".They said the decision removes protections for British child trafficking victims in cases where national security is involved and leaves their client ""in unlawful, arbitrary and indefinite detention without trial in a Syrian camp"".Her legal team said ""every possible avenue to challenge this decision will be urgently pursued"" without providing further details of any potential appeal.A spokesman for the Home Office said it was ""pleased"" with the outcome, adding: ""The government´s priority remains maintaining the safety and security of the UK and we will robustly defend any decision made in doing so.""Mr Javid also welcomed the ruling. Ministers must have the ""power to prevent anyone entering our country who is assessed to pose a threat to it"", he said. Human rights groups and campaigners have criticised the ruling and the government´s position, maintaining that Ms Begum was a child exploitation victim.Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK´s refugee and migrant rights director, said: ""The home secretary shouldn´t be in the business of exiling British citizens.""Conservative MP David Davis, who has repeatedly challenged the government on civil liberties issues, described the situation as a ""shameful abdication of responsibility and must be remedied"".

Bank of England boss says UK interest rates may rise further - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Vishala Sri-PathmaBusiness reporter, BBCInterest rates may need to go up again to slow the cost of living down, Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey has said.Mr Bailey said raising rates higher may be ""appropriate"" to control inflation but said nothing was decided yet.Raising interest rates helps to control price rises by making it more expensive to borrow money. People tend to borrow less, spend less and save more.The next rate decision is on 23 March and Mr Bailey said the Bank would assess the latest data before deciding.""I would caution against suggesting either that we are done with increasing Bank Rate, or that we will inevitably need to do more,"" Mr Bailey said at an event hosted by public relations firm Brunswick Group.""Some further increase in Bank Rate may turn out to be appropriate, but nothing is decided. The incoming data will add to the overall picture of the economy and the outlook for inflation, and that will inform our policy decisions.""In February, the Bank raised rates to 4%, the highest level for 14 years. Analysts believe the rate will peak at 4.5% in the summer.How high could interest rates go?Mr Bailey had previously said inflation - the rate at which prices rise - and wages data since February´s rise had been as expected, which some took as a signal rates would not go up in March. He warned that the Bank faces a difficult balancing act.""If we do too little with interest rates now, we will only have to do more later on,"" he said.He said the Bank needed to keep a close eye on how the interest rate rises it had already made were working to bring prices down.Inflation has fallen for three consecutive months to 10.1% after hitting a record high of 11.1% in October. It is currently more than five times the Bank´s inflation target of 2%. The Bank expects the rate of inflation to fall further this year, with energy bills forecast to rise a lot less than they did last year. Eating out lessThe Bank also released its annual survey on the cost of living which found households were changing their buying habits to cope with higher prices. The survey found that people were eating out less, cancelling subscription services, and switching to supermarket own-brand foods. Prices have been going up quickly worldwide, as Covid restrictions eased and consumers spent more. Many firms are having problems getting enough goods to sell. And with more buyers chasing too few goods, prices have increased. There has also been a very sharp rise in oil and gas costs - a challenge that has been made worse by Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.The Bank has predicted the UK will slide into recession - a period of economic decline - but this will not be as long or as severe as it previously thought.Related TopicsInflationCost of livingBank of EnglandAndrew Bailey",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64810682,01,03,2023,bbc,uk
Ukraine conflict: What war crimes is Russia accused of? - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersThe International Criminal Court in the Hague has issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin.It accuses him of being responsible for war crimes in Ukraine, including the unlawful deportation of children.Russia´s Commissioner for Children´s Rights, Ms Maria Lvova-Belova, is also subject to an arrest warrant.According to Ukraine, tens of thousands of possible war crimes have been carried out by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine in February last year.What is a war crime?""Even war has rules"", as the International Committee of the Red Cross says. These are set out in treaties called the Geneva Conventions along with other international laws and agreements. Military forces cannot deliberately attack civilians - nor the infrastructure that is vital to their survival. Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines, and chemical or biological weapons. The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers, who have rights as prisoners of war. Serious offences such as murder, rape or mass persecution of a group are known as ""crimes against humanity"" or in some circumstances ""genocide"".What are the latest allegations against President Putin?The United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has said there is evidence of the illegal transfer of hundreds of Ukrainian children to Russia.Russia has introduced policies such as forcing children to take Russian citizenship and placing them in foster families to ""create a framework in which some of the children may end up remaining permanently"" in Russia, the commission´s report notes.While the transfers were supposed to be temporary, ""most became prolonged"", with both parents and children facing ""an array of obstacles in establishing contact"", the UN investigators wrote.Ukraine government figures put the number of children forcibly taken to Russia at 16,221.These forced deportations ""violate international humanitarian law and amount to a war crime"", concludes the UN report.What other war crimes is Russia said to have carried out in Ukraine?The UN said that in addition to the rapes, killings and ""widespread"" torture, Moscow could be responsible for the even more serious ""crimes against humanity"" - notably the wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine´s energy infrastructure that began last October.Mass burial sites have been found in several parts of Ukraine previously occupied by Russian troops, including some holding civilian bodies showing signs of torture. In April 2022, more than 400 bodies of civilians were found in Bucha, a town on the outskirts of KyivIn September 2022, 450 bodies - mostly of civilians - were found in mass graves in Izium, in Kharkiv regionPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russian troops could have committed more than 400 war crimes in the Kherson region while it was under their occupation from March to November 2022In March 2022, Russian forces carried out an air strike on a theatre in Mariupol which was being used as a refuge for childrenA hospital in Mariupol was also struck in March last yearImage source, ReutersImage caption, Mariupol theatre after the air strikeHow can war crimes be prosecuted?Ukraine´s courts have already prosecuted one Russian soldier. 21-year-old Russian tank commander Vadim Shishimarin was jailed for life for shooting an unarmed civilian, 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka, a few days after the invasion began. It may prove easier, however, to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes than military commanders or senior politicians.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Vadim Shishimarin was the first Russian soldier to be tried for war crimesHugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch says establishing the ""chain of command"" is very important for any future trials, including whether a leader authorised an atrocity - or turned a blind eye to it. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine - going back as far as 2013, before Russia´s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Its chief prosecutor, British lawyer Karim Khan, believes there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out. However, the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects, and Russia is not a signatory to the agreement which set up the court - so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.The ICC generally takes over prosecutions for war crimes in countries where the court systems are too weak to carry out the prosecutions themselves.So far, however, it seems Ukraine´s courts have been able to mount their own cases. By the end of August, its prosecutor general had charged 135 suspected war criminals.Image source, Getty ImagesThe ICC can bring a prosecution against political leaders for ""waging aggressive war"". This covers an unjustified invasion or conflict not undertaken in self-defence. However, Professor Philippe Sands, an expert on international law at University College London, says the ICC couldn´t prosecute Russian leaders such as President Vladimir Putin for this - again, because the country isn´t a signatory to the court. In theory, the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But Russia could veto this. Prof Sands says world leaders should set up a one-off tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression in Ukraine.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaInternational Criminal CourtInternational Court of JusticeVladimir PutinUkraineTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished40 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished19 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Sir Keir Starmer says he's not talking down UK economy - BBC News,"Image source, PA MediaBy Faisal Islam & Lucy HookerEconomics editor & Business reporterSir Keir Starmer has said he is not ""talking down"" Britain when warning that Poland is on course to overtake the UK within a decade in terms of the size of its economy per person.The Labour leader was launching details of his party´s ""mission"" to make the UK the fastest growing G7 economy.He was speaking to business leaders and economists in the City of London.Labour´s analysis said Bulgaria and Romania could also overtake the UK if current trends continued until 2040.Asked in a BBC interview if he was talking down the British economy, Sir Keir said: ""No, I think what´s talking down Britain is having absolutely no plan, burning through three prime ministers and four chancellors in one year. ""My main concern has been that we´ve got fantastic potential and talent and skills and innovation in Britain but we haven´t got the growth that we need. We need a plan for growth, a strategy for growth.""Monday´s announcement from Labour reveals a little bit more about the opposition´s economic priorities. It will measure its G7 chart-topping growth mission on a per capita basis.Labour explicitly says a ""bad Brexit deal"" is exacerbating the nation´s economic challenges, calling for a ""reset"" to relations with Europe. It canvases for ideas on both a closer relationship with Europe and the UK response to the US and Europe pouring investment into green and high tech businesses.Asked to flesh out what Labour´s ""reset"" in relations with the EU would mean in practice, Sir Kier reiterated that his party would not be rejoining the European Single Market or Customs Union, but did say he wanted to pursue ""every opportunity"" for trade deals with countries across the world.He said Monday´s Northern Ireland protocol deal would open the door to stronger post-Brexit relations with Europe, and that was one of the reasons he would lend Labour´s votes to the PM to support the deal.""I do think we need to reset that relationship with the EU and want to see the UK and EU have a better relationship than we´ve got now. And I do think that progress on the Protocol is a first step"".Starmer unveils Labour´s five missions for the UKWatch: Sunak vs Starmer: How their pledges measure upRishi Sunak´s five promises analysedLabour announced last week that if elected, it would pursue five ""missions"": the first is for the UK to achieve the ""highest sustained growth"" in the G7.The other missions - broad themes on what Labour wants to achieve in power - include turning the UK into a ""clean energy superpower"",  improving the NHS, reforming the justice system and raising education standards.The party has promised to provide more specific policy proposals later in the year. ""We´ve got to find the courage to take on vested interests,"" Sir Keir said in his speech earlier on Monday.""So, if you think it´s not government´s role to shape markets, that we´re only here to serve them; that a labour market which locks in low pay and productivity is something beyond reform; or that the planning system should favour the already wealthy, not the new houses, wind farms and laboratories we need to create more wealth… then that´s not going to work for us,"" he said.In the first indication of how the mission on the economy would be measured, Labour said it would look at growth in output per person and compare that to other countries. Labour said the Tories had put the country on a ""path of decline""  and if recent growth trends continued, people in the UK would be worse off than Poland´s population by 2030.It said UK GDP per capita grew at an average annual rate of 0.5% in real terms between 2010 and 2021, while Poland´s grew 3.6%, (based on World Bank data).If those trends continued, by 2030 people in the UK would each be £500 ($600) poorer than Poland´s population, Labour said, and by 2040 would have fallen behind Hungary and Romania.It also plans to look at living standards via the measure of disposable income for the median UK household, with the ambition to make progress towards eliminating the gap between the median British family and those in France and Germany by the end of the parliament. However Sir Keir also suggested he should be judged on whether people ""feel better off"" at the end of a Labour term in government.Business targetLabour has been wooing the business community, suggesting it would provide long-term, stable government in contrast to last autumn´s rapid change of Conservative prime ministers, and the disruption on the financial markets.However, Sir Keir has previously said he supports the increase in corporation tax - from 19% to 25% - that is coming in April, arguing that businesses are more concerned about stability than taxes.He has also previously promised sweeping constitutional reform, which he said would unleash potential in the nations and regions of the UK, and has said he would ""make Brexit work"".Tesco chairman John Allan said: ""Growth can best be achieved by a partnership between government and business. Now we need to work together to create a detailed plan so that if Labour form the next government, they can hit the ground running on day one.""

"Still time to save Our Wild Isles, say UK conservation charities - BBC News","Image source, Getty ImagesBy Justin RowlattClimate editorThree of Britain´s biggest conservation charities are joining forces to try to halt the destruction of UK nature.They say they want to use their collective voice to call on everyone to act now to protect the natural world. Between them, The National Trust, WWF and RSPB have 8.5 million members.""We´ve come together because whilst we have spectacular nature here in the UK, it is in crisis,"" said Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF, which has 1.5m members. The ""Save Our Wild Isles"" campaign aims to use Sir David Attenborough´s new five-part series focusing on UK nature to help catalyse action. The first episode of Wild Isles was broadcast on BBC1 last night and highlighted some of the stunning wildlife that still exists in the UK. But Sir David warned viewers ""how fragile and fragmented our nature is"". He said the UK is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world.""Never has there been a more important time to invest in our own wildlife,"" the 96-year-old told viewers, as he sat surrounded by puffins on the island of Skomer off the Welsh coast in the final scene of the first episode.The RSPB and WWF are credited as co-producers of the series, but the BBC says they had no editorial input on the programme. ""We need to use the love which people have for nature and amplify it to make sure everyone plays a part to make a difference,"" said Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, which has 5.8m members.The charities want individuals, businesses, public bodies and our politicians to participate. ""It will take every single one of us to play our part,"" said Rebecca Munro, the executive director of the RSPB, which has 1.2m members.  Charities can´t do this on their own, she told the BBC.  ""It needs to be individuals. It needs to be communities coming together. It needs to be businesses, and it needs to be our leaders.""Image source, © naturepl.com / Paul Harris / 2020VISION / WWFImage caption, The charities say there is just enough of the UK´s natural world still left to saveThe campaign urges us all to ""Go Wild Once a Week"".

UK scrambles to help tech firms after Silicon Valley Bank collapse - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) offices in the US were shut as customers sought their fundsBy Tom Espiner & Laura KuenssbergBBC NewsThe government says it is working ""at pace"" on a plan to prevent UK tech firms caught in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank from running out of cash.The Treasury said it wanted to ""minimise damage to some of our most promising companies in the UK"" after the US bank´s failure on Friday.Firms could start to run into problems on Monday morning without intervention.US regulators shut down the lender on Friday in what is the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.The bank´s UK subsidiary will be put into insolvency from Sunday evening.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey ""were up late last night"" and have been ""working through the weekend to come up with a solution"" to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank UK, Mr Hunt told the BBC´s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.While there´s no risk to the UK´s financial system as a whole, ""there is a serious risk to some of our most promising companies in technology and life sciences"", Mr Hunt said.""These are very important companies to the UK, a very important part of our future.""We want to find a way that minimises or avoids all losses to those incredibly promising [firms],"" Mr Hunt said, although he said he could not commit to companies recovering all of their money.Faisal Islam: Is the UK right to bail out tech firms?He said the government was ""working at pace"" to bring forward a plan to make sure firms can meet their cashflow needs ""within the next few days"".That plan will mean companies can pay their staff, he said. ""That´s the big ask we´ve had in the last 24 hours.""But Rachel Reeves, Labour´s shadow chancellor, said firms need to urgently hear how the government planned to help. She said start-ups needed to pay wages and suppliers, and some could feel pressure on share prices, or even have investors saying they no longer have confidence.""We need, tomorrow morning, to hear from the government, how they are going to protect firms,"" she said, whether that is guarantees, or working with the US government on a rescue for the bank.Asked whether the government would come up with a solution by the time the markets open on Monday morning, Mr Sunak said: ""The Treasury is working at pace.""Tech firm concernsMore than 200 bosses of UK tech companies signed a letter addressed to Mr Hunt on Saturday calling for government intervention.The letter, from Fintech Founders, said many financial technology firms did all of their banking with SVB ""and will therefore go into receivership imminently unless preventative action is taken"".""The firms affected by the collapse of SVB serve millions of people in the UK along with businesses that are critical to our economy,"" the letter said.""The cost of inaction here means that these firms could fail in the short-term and your technology growth ambitions will fail in the long-term.""Image caption, Toby Mather, founder of LingumiToby Mather, chief executive and co-founder of Lingumi, an education technology start-up, told the BBC his business was very exposed. ""85% of our cash is held in Silicon Valley Bank.. [So this] is a really existential threat to us because I´ve got to pay my employees and they´ve got kids and mortgages and so on."" One source in a tech firm told the BBC the situation could be ""pretty terminal"" for many UK start-ups. ""This Monday, at least 200 firms employing tens of thousands of people will find they can´t pay their staff or suppliers because the bank they had an account with has gone bust,"" the source said.Between 30% and 40% or UK start-ups employing up to 50,000 people could be affected by the collapse, the source added.Michael Moore, director general of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, said this was an ""urgent matter"" and that ""help is needed by tomorrow [Monday]"" for tech firms and entrepreneurs.SVB collapsed in the US after failing to raise $2.25bn (£1.9bn) to plug a loss from the sale of assets, mainly US government bonds, that were affected by higher interest rates. Its troubles prompted a run on the bank in the US and sparked investor fears about the general state of the banking sector.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday she was working closely with regulators to protect US depositors, but she was not considering a bailout.Financial shares hit by Silicon Valley Bank slumpSilicon Valley Bank specialised in lending to early-stage businesses, and the company served nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. It employs more than 8,500 people globally, with most of its operations in the US. But it has been under pressure as higher rates make it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales. More clients were withdrawing deposits in a trend that snowballed last week.Silicon Valley Bank UK, which has stopped making payments or accepting deposits, is officially expected to go into insolvency on Sunday evening.The move will allow individual depositors to be paid up to £85,000 from the UK´s deposit insurance scheme.However, the government committing to protecting any more than this would create a ""serious moral hazard"", Treasury permanent secretary Nick Macpherson tweeted - that is, depositors would lack an incentive to guard against risk if they expected all of their losses to be covered in the event of a bank collapse.

YouTube accused of collecting UK children's data - BBC News,"Image caption, Duncan McCann says he has tried to explain to his own children how platforms like YouTube use their dataBy Zoe KleinmanTechnology editorYouTube has been accused of collecting the viewing data of children aged under 13, in breach of a UK data privacy code designed to protect children.Campaigner Duncan McCann has lodged an official complaint with the Information Commissioner´s Office (ICO).He says the site is gathering data about the videos children watch, where they are watching and what device they are watching it on.YouTube said it had invested in protecting families.This included treating all children´s content as though children were viewing it, even on an adult´s account, it said.""We remain committed to continuing our engagement with the ICO on this priority work, and with other key stakeholders including children, parents and child-protection experts,"" a spokesperson said.The platform is owned by the US tech giant Alphabet, which is also the parent company of Google.The firm has always said its service was not intended for use by children below the age of 13, and it offers a separate children´s app called YouTube Kids as well as a ""supervised experience"" which requires parental consent.Mr McCann says plenty of children watch YouTube content on family devices, where this data can be gathered by default because it is not registered as a children´s account.His complaint is believed to be the first test of the ICO children´s code, which was introduced in 2020, when tech firms were given one year to comply with it.Children´s internet code: What is it and how will it work?Its terms include providing a high level of privacy for children by default and not using design features that encourage them to provide more data.YouTube said at the time it would turn off default auto-play on videos and block ad targeting and personalisation for all children.According to the regulator Ofcom, 89% of children in the UK between three and 17 used the video platform in 2021.Firms found to be in breach of the children´s internet code can face large fines, similar to the penalties for breaching data protection laws.The ICO said it would consider the complaint carefully.Mr McCann is acting in a personal capacity, but works for the campaign group 5Rights Foundation, which has championed the code.  ""My preferred reform that YouTube should make is that actually when you enter YouTube, they don´t collect any unnecessary and process any unnecessary information,"" he said.""The best way to ensure that they are only collecting the data of adults who are properly consenting would be to have a process where adults can sign in to the tracking, recommendation systems, profiling, targeted ads.""He added that he believed it would be ""a minority"" of users who would choose to do so.In 2019, YouTube was fined $170m (£139m) by a US regulator for violating children´s privacy laws.This followed a similar accusation that it was collecting data on children under 13 without parental consent.YouTube did not admit responsibility but it did pay the fine and also changed its business practices as a result, said Stephanie Hare, author of Technology is Not Neutral.""It assumed that anyone watching children´s content would be potentially under the age of 13. And so it now collects far less data on that type of content, and also doesn´t send personalised ads to people watching that content,"" she said.""The solution exists, they just need to pull it out of the toolbox.""Related TopicsYouTubeInternet privacyInformation Commissioner´s OfficeData protectionPrivacy",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64786968,01,03,2023,bbc,uk
Climate change: Warming could raise UK flood damage bill by 20% - BBC News,"Related TopicsClimate changeImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Flood damage costs the UK an estimated £700m annuallyBy Victoria Gill and Kate StephensBBC NewsResearchers have produced a detailed ""future flood map"" of Britain - simulating the impact of flooding as climate change takes its toll. It has revealed that annual damage caused by flooding could increase by more than a fifth in today´s terms over the next century. That could be reduced if pledges to reduce global carbon emissions are met.Climate change is set to have a particular impact on ""hotspots"" where homes and businesses are in harm´s way. Image source, BBC NewsEven if climate change pledges are met - keeping temperature increase to around 1.8C - places including south-east England, north-west England and south Wales are set to experience significantly increased flooding. The detail in the new ""flood risk map"" also reveals locations that will be largely unaffected. This level of detail, the researchers say, is critical for planning decisions. To create these flood risk maps, the research team from Bristol University and Fathom - a company that assesses flood and climate risk - simulated all types of flooding in the coming decades.They used information about terrain, river flow, rainfall patterns and sea level to build a detailed picture of how much flood damage there would be to people´s homes and businesses across England, Scotland and Wales. They combined this with Met Office climate predictions over the next century.The team is also currently modelling flooding in Northern Ireland to expand the forecasts to include the whole of the UK as the climate warms.Prepare for flooding now, public urgedWhy drought can lead to dangerous floodingThe annual cost of flood damage across the UK currently, according to the Association of British Insurers, is £700m. Chief research officer at Fathom, Dr Oliver Wing, explained that it was crucial to understand how that ""flood risk landscape"" would change in a warming world, because it will be different for every community.  ""Our model shows that there are many places where flood risk is growing,"" said Dr Wing. ""Being able to understand the communities where this is likely to happen allows us to make sensible investment decisions - about flood defence structures, natural flood management or even moving people out of harm´s way.""    Image caption, Volunteers in Calderdale create diversions for the water to slow its flow down the hillsideCalder Valley in West Yorkshire is one of the areas at particularly high risk from flooding caused by heavy rain. Katie Kimber, from community volunteer group Slow the Flow, explained that the steep-sided valley meant that run-off swelled the river quickly. ""When it happens it´s really fast - it´s a wave of destruction,"" she told BBC News. ""Then it´s a case of clearing up the damage - it´s mentally and physically very hard for people here.""During the 2015 Boxing Day floods, more than 3,000 properties were flooded in the Calder Valley, causing an estimated £150m of damage. Image source, @bezberesford via PAImage caption, Heavy rainfall can swell rivers rapidly, putting communities at riskAfter the clean-up, Katie and other volunteers started their own flood-prevention efforts, with the help of the National Trust. ""We´re essentially creating speed bumps for the water running down the hillside [before it gets to the homes and businesses below],"" she explained. ""We´re stuffing the channels with branches."" The community members also dig diversion channels to divert and slow water down. Calderdale is a flood hotspot on the new map. But many places are set to see very little change or - when it comes to flood risk - actually improve, Dr Wing explained. Those areas include swathes of north-east and central England as well as eastern and northern Scotland.Image source, BBC NewsThis level of detail, according to the scientists, is missing from the government´s own current efforts to measure flood risk.  ""Current government flood maps are not scrutinised by scientists, generally speaking,"" said Dr Wing. ""The methods they use are not transparent.""And every pound we spend on flood risk mitigation is a pound that could be spent on teachers, nurses, hospitals, schools, so it´s really important that it´s grounded in accurate science."" The scientists add that the UK as a whole is ""not well adapted to the flood risks it currently faces, let alone any further increases in risk due to climate change"".  They hope this detailed forecast could help change that. Back on the Calderdale hillside, Katie says that better forecasting would be invaluable. ""Anything that helps us to prepare and plan,"" she said. ""Because we want to keep living here - we love this area. So we need to face these challenges, particularly with climate change."" Dr Wing added that the new, detailed maps could help land use planning decisions.  ""Those are something that ultimately put people in the way of floods in the first place,"" he said. ""That´s something we see the world over - that the most important part of flood risk is where people are, not necessarily how the floods are changing."" Related TopicsFloodsClimate changeEnvironment",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64866058,07,03,2023,bbc,uk
Concern over closure of Welsh welcome centres for Ukraine refugees - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, 6,500 refugees with sponsors in Wales have fled Ukraine, say ministersA cross-party Senedd committee says it is concerned at the planned closure of Welsh welcome centres for Ukrainian refugees.The group of politicians questioned whether there is enough accommodation for the refugees to move to.BBC Wales understands that ministers hope to move most Ukrainian refugees out of the centres within 18 months.The Welsh government said it exceeded recommendations in the report.Large numbers of refugees remain in the Welsh government´s initial accommodation centres.The report comes as the Welsh government announced it would step in to increase payments to people hosting refugees in Wales from £350 to £500.Wales scales back services for Ukraine refugeesI told friends I´d play football, but war broke outCentres housing Ukrainian refugees set to closeLast month, the Welsh government announced that the welcome centres would eventually close.They are part of the super-sponsor scheme, where ministers in Cardiff have supported 3,200 refugees - part of the 6,500 who have come to Wales overall.Welcome centres have included hotels, holiday parks and university accommodation. A total of 17 hotels are used for initial accommodation, as well as 10 other venues.Officials say more than 1,500 have moved out, such as into the homes of sponsors and private rented accommodation. Currently 1,200 are left in initial accommodation.Welsh government sources stress there is no intention to close all initial accommodation imminently, and that they aim to shut hotels first.Earlier in March Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt reassured the Senedd that no refugees would be made homeless.A sum of £40m has been set aside for the next financial year from April to support the scheme - with most going on accommodation - and £20m has been earmarked for the year after.´Surprised´In a report, the local government committee said: ""We are concerned by reports that the Welsh government will begin closing its welcome centres.""We are surprised by such a step, given the positive feedback from the Welsh government and stakeholders on the role of the centres"".It said Ms Hutt ""should provide an update to the Senedd as a matter of urgency to clarify the welsh government´s position"".""We are particularly concerned as to whether there is sufficient accommodation available for Ukrainians to move into"""" the report added.The committee, said there had been no official announcement on the welcome centre plans, and also called for a ""long-term plan"" to ensure sufficient provision.On Thursday the Welsh government announced it would provide £2.5m to allow councils to increase ""thank you"" payments to Ukrainian guests.The UK government - which funds most of the money - plans to do the same but only for refugees who have been in the country for 12 months.Another £2m will be given to Welsh councils to help more Ukrainians move into longer term accommodation.Ms Hutt said the rise recognised the ""enormity of their kindness"" and the impact of the cost of living crisis on hosts.""People from all over Wales have stepped up, showed true compassion and been there for families forced to flee their homes,"" Ms Hutt said.John Griffiths, chairman of the committee, said: ""We welcome the Welsh government´s announcement that it will fund an increase in the ´thank you´ payments to people in Wales hosting Ukrainian guests.""He added: ""However, we´re concerned at reports that the Welsh government will soon begin to close welcome centres for Ukrainian guests and whether there is sufficient availability of move-on accommodation to meet demand. ""The Committee´s recent report on homelessness highlighted the already high number of people currently living in temporary accommodation in Wales, which is why we´re calling on the Welsh Government to set out how it intends to ensure that those currently in welcome centres are moved to suitable accommodation.""A Welsh Government spokesman welcomed the report, adding: ""We have today announced how we will continue to support people fleeing the war in Ukraine and support those already in Wales to move into longer-term accommodation with an additional £40m investment over the next financial year.""Our approach meets, and in some cases exceeds, the recommendations in the report.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRefugees and asylum seekersWelsh governmentJane HuttUkraineUkrainian refugees",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-64976609,16,03,2023,bbc,uk

Ukraine war: The shrimp shell fabric saving lives - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage caption, Dr Irnya Rybinkina volunteers for the charity Smart Medical AidBy Matthew HillBBC West health correspondentAn ""anti-bleeding"" fabric made from shrimp shells is saving thousands of lives in Ukraine, according to an NHS doctor working in the war-zone.The bandages are coated with an extract known as chitosan that can stem bleeding by forming clots.Made by Nonwovenn in Somerset, the bandages are in first-aid kits being sent out to the Ukrainian military.Dr Iryna Rybinkina said: ""It´s been saving a lot of lives, thousands of them, I mean.""The consultant cardiac anaesthetist, who volunteers for the charity Smart Medical Aid, left her job in Brighton to train medics on the front line and has used the bandages many times. She says she uses them alongside other compression bandages on the battlefield.She said: ""Our charity supplied about 110,000, and we get a lot of feedback from the people who are using them. ""The first thing is your put a tourniquet on, and then you try to stop the bleed by packing the wound.Image caption, The bandages are coated with a substance that expands into a gel-like clot when they make contact with blood""So if there is a re-bleed, then you repack the one you take out and you put that in.""The Bridgwater supplier said Ukrainian military rang shortly after the invasion asking for as many as they could make.The gauze aims to stop heavy bleeding from wounds with 60 seconds of compression, according to the manufacturer´s website.Chitosan is extracted from shrimp shells and then purified. When it comes into contact with blood it swells into a gel to make a clot. Dr Rybinkina added: ""We get a lot of feedback from the people using them. ""They say ´you know what your first aid kit it, did save lives. We used the tourniquet and the Celox and the person actually arrived alive at the evacuation point´."" Image caption, Production line at the Nonwovenn factory in Bridgwater where the bandages are madeThe coated bandages are also used by the US and UK military and were also deployed in the 2014 conflict between Russia and Ukraine.The bandages are incorporated into first-aid kits sent out by MedTrade in Crewe in Cheshire. Nonwovenn chairman, David Lamb, said: ""Our Somerset team is part of a remarkable British success story which is saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians caught up in Europe´s worst conflict since World War II.""Since I interviewed Dr Rybinkina, she was involved in a serious road traffic accident on her way back from duties in Ukraine, and she is now being treated for a broken arm.

Following the same selection process as last year, the BBC has been working with a management company to pick the act.Figure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsMuller was born in 1997 - the year the UK last won Eurovision - and has previously supported Little Mix on tour as well as working with artists like Aitch and Sigala.""I´m a huge fan of so many of the artists that have found success at Eurovision, from ABBA to Måneskin,"" Muller said.""Sam Ryder was so amazing last year and proved the UK can be back on the left-hand side of the leaderboard.""  Ryder came second in last year´s contest, giving the UK its best result in 20 years. Muller said she was aware she had a lot to live up to.""This is obviously such a level up from anything I´ve ever done, and I can really feel it,"" said the singer. ""You´ve got to go big and you´ve got to do it right.""She said Ryder had already been in touch with some tips. In an Instagram video, he also congratulated Muller on her selection.""You´re in for the most wild, inexplicable ride and I´m chuffed for you,"" he said. ""Have a blast.""Image source, CORINNE CUMMING / EBUImage caption, The UK´s Sam Ryder won the jury vote in last year´s contest with his song Space ManAfter years of dismal results, Ryder turned things around for the UK at the 2022 competition, placing second to Ukraine.TaP Music management, which has worked with Dua Lipa, Lana Del Rey and Ellie Goulding, were the team who selected the TikTok star and his song Space Man for the contest.This year, they started with ""a shortlist of 50 or more"" acts, said co-owner Ben Mawson; but when they met Muller, they instantly ""fell in love with her"".""We needed someone with a huge amount of charisma and an incredibly strong voice, who can perform flawlessly on the night without making any mistakes,"" added the firm´s co-president Anna Neville.""Mae is witty, she´s funny, We´ve got so much faith in her. Mae is going to bring it home.""Spiky break-up songs are Mae Muller´s trademark, and I Wrote A Song is no exception. Over a polished club beat, she gleefully takes down a cheating ex, listing all the things she wants to do to him - make a scene outside his house, crash his car, generally make his life a misery. Instead, she goes meta, working out her anger by writing a song about writing a song about him. ""And that´s what we call growth, ladies and gentlemen,"" she said in a video introducing the song. Described by one colleague as ""a Bulgarian nightclub banger"" and by my 13-year-old as ""too good for Eurovision"", it´s certainly the most contemporary, credible song we´ve sent to the contest in a long time. Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Muller was pictured outside Radio 2 headquarters after being announced as the UK entrantMae´s sassy north London charisma conveys the depth of her contempt, and the singalong chorus is instantly memorable. The flourishes of flamenco guitar are more Mi Chico Latino than La Isla Bonita. But still, they´re an astute acknowledgment of Europe´s influence on a British music industry that too often sees itself as superior. As for the song´s chances, I´m in two minds. My first reaction to the song was like a cat tasting wasabi: Get this horror show away from me. It took a couple of listens to fully embrace Mae´s campy insouciance. After 24 hours, I can´t get it out of my head - but in Liverpool, she only gets one chance to impress the Eurovision voters. The country will be holding its breath to see what they decide. Like Ryder, Muller will spend the months leading up to the contest promoting her song to outside the UK.""There´s an extra Eurovision dynamic, which involves going to countries you wouldn´t ordinarily go to on a promotional campaign,"" said Mawson. ""Lots of travel, lots of radio and TV, lots of interviews. It´s going to be be a tiring few months for her - but hopefully fun.""Muller said she was raring to go. ""I can´t wait to see you all. I can´t wait to get to Liverpool,"" she posted on TikTok. ""I´m very excited! What is life?""Tickets sold outMost of the 37 competing countries have confirmed the song and act they will be sending to Liverpool, with a deadline set for 13 March for the handful who have yet to confirm their plans in public.There are typically two ways a Eurovision entry is chosen: An internal selection, in which an act is chosen behind the scenes; or a national selection, involving a TV show where the winner gets to fly their country´s flag in Liverpool.Thousands of Eurovision fans follow how each country chooses its act with events like Super Saturday gripping devotees across the continent.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, The rundown on the 2023 contest in 50 secondsNormally, the country who wins hosts it the following year but organisers ruled it was too dangerous in Ukraine, following Russia´s invasion, so the BBC was asked to host it instead.Earlier this week, tickets for May´s event sold out in 90 minutes, with fans now being warned scammers are targeting their hotel bookings with phishing cyber-attacks.All the build-up, insights and analysis is explored each week on a new BBC podcast called Eurovisioncast.Eurovisioncast is available on BBC Sounds, or search wherever you get your podcasts from.Related TopicsTelevisionEurovision Song ContestRadioLiverpoolMusic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64888312,09,03,2023,bbc,uk
HSBC swoops in to rescue UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Jeremy Hunt: ´We could have seen some of our most important companies wiped out´By Michael RaceBusiness reporter, BBC NewsHSBC has swooped to buy the UK arm of collapsed US Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), bringing relief to UK tech firms who warned they could go bust without help.Customers and businesses who had been unable to withdraw their money will now be able to access it as normal.The government and the Bank of England led the talks and worked through the night to scramble together the deal, which involves no taxpayer money.HSBC said it paid just £1 for the SVB´s UK arm.Speaking to the BBC, HSBC boss Noel Quinn said the deal had been ""too good an opportunity to miss"" and had ensured ""a crisis in one institution did not become a systemic crisis"".Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators on Friday in what was the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.Its collapse sent shockwaves across the tech industry over the possible impact it could have on businesses, with some firms telling the BBC they could go bust if deposits were not secured.Lessons learned from failed ´tech bank´ SVBMoney in failed US bank is safe, government saysShares fall as fears persist about failed US bankWith fears over how firms would be able to access cash on Monday morning, frantic talks were held between Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, the prime minister, the Bank of England governor, HSBC bosses and civil servants to find a solution.The Bank of England said no other UK banks had been ""materially affected"" by SVB´s collapse and said the banking system remained ""safe, sound, and well capitalised"".Although the UK arm of SVB was small with just over 3,000 business customers, its collapse would have presented a risk for a sector which the government views as pivotal to the UK´s future economic success.Mr Hunt said some of the firms only had bank accounts with SVB UK, ""so for that reason we were faced with a situation where we could have seen some of our most important companies, our most strategic companies, wiped out and that would have been extremely dangerous"".However, he added there was ""never a systemic risk to our financial stability in the UK"".Image caption, Toby Mather, founder of Lingumi, said he´d had an ""anxious weekend""Toby Mather, chief executive and co-founder of Lingumi, an education technology start-up, said 85% of its cash was tied up with the bank and he had had a very ""anxious weekend"".""We had enough money in bank accounts outside the UK and enough revenue coming through each week from our customers that we could look our staff in the eyes at nine o´clock this morning and say we can make payroll in two weeks, but it would have been very uncertain from then"", Mr Mather said.Sebastian Weidt, chief executive of Universal Quantum, a tech company which employs about 40 people and held all its funds with SVB, said the deal was a ""huge relief"" after an ""unbelievably stressful"" few days.Although its US parent was in financial trouble, Silicon Valley Bank UK was in reasonable financial health when it was bought for £1 by HSBC. It had adequate capital and was making reasonable profits. Bank of England sources confirmed this weekend´s intervention was more a preventive strike before the collapse of its US parent sparked mass withdrawals from the UK business. What that means is that HSBC got one hell of a deal which it owed to its size and strength - with regulators confident that Europe´s largest bank could easily take on any risk from SVB UK´s customers.It seems the only thing wrong with SVB UK was its name. While not a Lehman Brothers moment, what the collapse of SVB US has highlighted is that many banks are riskier than they look on paper as they have all sustained losses on their investments in government bonds as interest rates have soared - pushing their value down. One reason why bank shares are lower again on Monday as that thought sinks in with jittery investors. What went wrong at Silicon Valley Bank?The rescue deal for the UK arm comes after the US agreed a rescue deal for customers in the US bank, with all depositors fully protected.SVB specialised in lending to start-up firms, and the company served nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that had listed on stock markets last year.The firm was under pressure as higher interest rates made it harder for its customers to raise money through private fundraising or share sales. More clients were withdrawing deposits in a trend that snowballed last week.The bank collapsed in the US on Friday after failing to raise enough money to plug losses from the sale of assets, mainly US government bonds, that were affected by higher rates. The knock-on impact on SVB´s UK arm sparked fears it could lead to the collapse of many smaller UK tech firms, with more than 200 tech bosses signing a letter calling for the government to step in.Former investment banker Sir Philip Augar said the UK government and regulators had a ""good weekend in actually avoiding a crisis"", but warned there was an irony in the collapse of SVB just as the government was considering ""slackening"" regulations in the financial services industry.""It shows that it´s a dangerous industry that can cause damage to the whole economy if it´s not controlled properly,"" he said.""It has the capability of delivering a nasty shock.""While the deal with HSBC was broadly welcomed, the Bank of London - a UK clearing bank - said it was a ""missed opportunity"".The bank, which was among firms that had put forward a rescue bid for SVB UK, said: ""It cannot be right that, once again, the heritage banks that have provided a poor service to UK entrepreneurs over many years benefit from their already dominant position.""Related TopicsUK bankingCompaniesHSBCBanking",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64937251,13,03,2023,bbc,uk
Starbucks to open 100 new UK stores this year - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Faarea MasudBusiness reporterStarbucks plans to open 100 new stores across the UK this year, while investing millions of pounds in upgrading existing cafes.It comes as the world´s largest coffee chain reported a big jump in sales in the UK for 2022, continuing its recovery from the pandemic. Last year the firm was reportedly looking to sell its British operations.Starbucks, which launched in the UK in 1998, has over 1,000 outlets in the country. Its UK expansion comes despite inflation - the rate at which prices rise - being near a 40-year-high, pushing up the cost of ingredients for the firm and eating into its profits. The firm also plans to open 300 new stores in the rest of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Pret A Manger gives staff third pay rise in a yearStarbucks illegally fired workers over union - judgeHowever, Duncan Moir, who lead´s firm´s EMEA business, said he remained ""cautious"" about economic outlook. ""Like many other businesses"", he said Starbucks had faced challenges including shortages of HGV drivers, rising supplier costs and shipping delays.It is also struggling with higher energy bills and demands for higher wages from staff. Hospitality companies across the UK have been putting up pay as they face a shortage of workers and the cost of living rises. Pret A Manger recently announced it will be giving its staff their third pay rise in 12 months.Starbucks said that since the pandemic, its customers´ habits had changed and as a result, the firm would seek to increase its number of drive-through branches, and invest in digital capabilities in its stores.It added that as many people continued to work from home, footfall at cafes in city centres and train stations had been slower to recover, with London being the exception.Starbucks last year was reportedly considering selling its UK business as it faced rising competition from other chains.The firm, which denied it ever began a formal sales process, had also been hit hard by pandemic restrictions around the world. About 70% of its UK shops are run as franchises, with the remainder owned by the company, and Starbucks said the new stores will be a mixture of both.

UK job vacancies fall for eighth time in a row - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter, BBC NewsJob vacancies in the UK have fallen for the eighth time in a row as companies blamed economic pressures for holding back on hiring new staff. The official figures come a day ahead of Wednesday´s Budget when the chancellor is expected to set out plans to encourage people back into work.The number of jobs on offer between December and February fell by 51,000 compared with the three months before.Despite the drop, the number of job vacancies remains high at 1.1 million.There are also 328,000 more vacancies compared to the pre-pandemic period of between January and March 2020.The rate of economic inactivity - people aged between 16 to 64 who are not in work and not seeking a job - dipped to 21.3% between November and January.This was driven by younger people aged between 16 to 24 either getting jobs or looking for work.However, there are still nine million economically inactive Britons who are not part of the workforce either because they are students, have retired or are suffering from long-term illness.On Wednesday, it is anticipated that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will detail how the government intends to entice people back into work. One measure expected to be announced is a boost to the amount that people can save for their pensions before it is taxed. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell said this move was ""an incredibly welcome start"", but added: ""It does little to address labour issues at the lower end of end of the scale."" James Reed, chairman of recruitment firm Reed, said that while there was a fall in new jobs ""it´s not cause to panic"".He told the BBC´s Today programme: ""Actually there are over 300,000 more vacancies than there were this time pre-pandemic, three years ago, so the labour market is pretty buoyant still which is surprising many people.""Robin Clevett, a self-employed carpenter and joiner who manages up to 10 subcontractors on construction projects, said that he was having to turn down work because there are not enough skilled workers available. Image caption, Carpenter Robin Clevett is inundated with work but skilled people are hard to find""Business is really buoyant at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""Everyone needs trades - they need people to do insulation work, they need people to do new builds, refurbish old builds, replace cladding. There´s so much work but there´s not enough labour to go around so that´s what has driven this massive demand and adverts everywhere for all kinds of trades.""He added: ""I personally won´t take on work now knowing I´m not going to find the staff. So I´m turning down opportunities.""On the eve of the chancellor´s so-called ""back to work"" Budget, the official numbers show that is already beginning to happen.Employment has risen again, but this time driven by part-time and the self-employed. While vacancies have fallen they still remain very high.  Wages are growing in cash terms versus last year but by still well below the inflation rate. On a month-to-month basis though, there is some evidence that pay growth is starting to stall.With unemployment still very low by international standards, and employment high, the jobs market remains a bright spot in the figures. This has underpinned a consumer more resilient than might be expected to the massive energy price shock.With the global financial system exhibiting some fragility after bank collapses in the US, the Bank of England could decide to hold off on further rate rises next week.Meanwhile, pay growth appeared to be stalling, according to the data from Office for National Statistics. The average weekly salary in the UK, excluding bonuses, in January stood at £589, up by £1 on a month before.Throughout 2022, the average salary rose by nearly £3 a month. That was not enough to keep up with the cost of living. The average salary fell by 2.4% in the three months to January compared to the same period last year after taking account rising prices, or inflation.While the rate of inflation is falling, it remains high at 10.1%. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""Although the inflation rate has come down a little, it´s still outstripping earnings growth, meaning real pay continues to fall.""The ONS also detailed that there were 220,000 working days lost to strike action in January. However, this was far lower than 822,000 recorded in December when widespread industrial action hit areas such as postal deliveries and train services.Related TopicsUnemploymentEmploymentUK economyPayRetirement",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64939336,14,03,2023,bbc,uk

"Ukraine war: Putin pays visit to occupied Mariupol, state media reports - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Russia´s President Putin tours Mariupol in occupied UkraineBy Laurence Peter & Samuel HortiBBC NewsRussian President Vladimir Putin has paid a surprise visit to Mariupol, a Ukrainian port captured by Russia after its forces pounded much of it to ruins.An official video shows Mr Putin driving a car through streets at night and speaking to people. The Kremlin says it happened late on Saturday.It is believed to be his first trip to a newly-occupied Ukrainian territory. Mariupol´s exiled mayor told BBC News that Mr Putin was a ""criminal"" who had ""returned to the scene of the crime"".""He has come in person to see what he has done,"" Vadym Boychenko said. ""He´s come to see what he will be punished for.""Other exiled Ukrainian city officials said Mr Putin had visited at night so he would not see the destroyed city in daylight.Tass news agency says he travelled to Mariupol by helicopter. In the video he is in the car with Russia´s Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin, who explains how the city is being rebuilt. The Kremlin has said the decision to drive round the city was made spontaneously by the Russian leader.Putin also visits the city´s Philharmonic Hall, which had been due to be used for trials of captured Ukrainian forces before they were released in a prisoner swap instead.The Russian leader is also reported to have met top military commanders in Rostov-on-Don, a Russian city just east of Mariupol.Mariupol has been under Russian occupation for more than 10 months after being devastated in one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the conflict. Ukraine says more than 20,000 people were killed there.UN analysis estimates that 90% of the buildings were damaged and around 350,000 people were forced to leave, out of a pre-war population of about 500,000. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Putin was filmed looking at maps near residential buildingsA group of locals have told the BBC that Russia is conducting an expensive campaign to rebuild the city and win over the hearts and minds of its people. The purpose is to assimilate Mariupol and make it Russia´s own. Russian authorities say 300,000 people are now living there.The fighting saw Russia strike a Mariupol theatre where hundreds of civilians were sheltering. The building collapsed, and at least 300 are believed to have died there.Ukraine and human rights groups say the attack amounted to a war crime. It is among incidents for which Mr Putin and his regime could be held legally responsible, the United Nations has said.The International Criminal Court said on Friday it had issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Putin over  involving the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. It means he could now be arrested if he sets foot in any of the court´s 123 member states.´You can rebuild Mariupol - you can´t bring back the dead´Russia declares victory at Mariupol steelworksOn Saturday Mr Putin made an unannounced visit to Crimea, to mark the ninth anniversary of Russia´s annexation of the territory from Ukraine. He visited a new Russian arts school, a children´s summer camp and future cultural projects, such as the New Russia museum and museum of Christianity, Russian state media reported.The Kyiv authorities have vowed to liberate all Russian-occupied territories, including Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.

The man extradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawl - BBC News,"Image caption, Rory McGrath with his wife and sons in the USBy Libby Sutcliffe & William McLennanBBC NewsDecades after moving to the US, retired construction worker Rory McGrath was extradited to the UK to face trial for a 41-year-old crime. Eventually he was found not guilty. Rory McGrath had just stepped through his front door carrying the morning newspaper when a dozen or so officers from the US Marshals Service arrived at his New York home with their guns drawn. They ordered his wife and twin 18-year-old sons out of bed at gunpoint. It was May 2021 and New York was starting to emerge from Covid restrictions, but for McGrath and his family it was just the start of a ""nightmare that has never ended"".The officers were acting at the request of prosecutors in England. McGrath, a retired construction worker, faced extradition and trial in the UK over his involvement in a drunken street fight four decades earlier. The story began in March 1980 when McGrath, an Irish-British national born in Leeds, was out drinking with friends. The 21-year-old, by his own admission, became involved in a drunken fight between two groups of young men. In his telling, he fled to a nearby pub when police arrived. ""I´m not getting involved with the police,"" he remembers thinking. But British prosecutors alleged he was part of a group that assaulted an officer, who suffered a broken nose, cuts and bruising while attempting to restrain a suspect. Five men were charged, including McGrath. Instead of facing justice, he fled to Ireland.He says he absconded because he believed he was being ""set up"". The case against him was based in part on the evidence of an off-duty officer, who has since died, who said he recognised McGrath running from the scene.""I believe I was forced to abscond because [of] the simple reason they fabricated identification,"" he says.McGrath says that as an Irish national living in England in the 1970s and 80s, he faced ""constant harassment"". ""All my life, since I can remember, [I was] constantly harassed by the English police, so I knew it wasn´t going to be a good outcome.""His life in England was set against the backdrop of the IRA bombings of the 1970s. A series of high-profile convictions linked to some of the attacks - including the Guildford Four, Birmingham Six and the Maguire Seven - were later found to be miscarriages of justice, involving false confessions and police misconduct. ""Tensions were high, always,"" says McGrath. In 1986, after several years living in Dublin working as a carpenter, he went to the US on holiday.""I was hearing a lot about it, so I went for a couple of weeks and I ended up staying for 12 years.""He met his wife Alice in New York in 1990. They married in 1992, and 10 years later he returned to Ireland to successfully apply for US citizenship.Image caption, Alice and Rory´s wedding dayAs a dual Irish-British citizen, he assumed that US authorities would have contacted the UK Home Office. ""I know that they knew where I was as early as 2002, for the simple reason all the paperwork from the citizenship went back to England."" he says. The Home Office has declined to answer questions about the case.McGrath says he did not view himself as a fugitive. He travelled to the UK on several occasions, using his own name and passport, including for his brother´s wedding in 1996. While accepting he had absconded in 1980, McGrath says he had come to believe the matter was closed. He was never contacted by authorities and experienced no difficulties while travelling in the UK. The first he knew of any extradition request was the US Marshals´ raid in 2021. But events had been set in motion six years earlier.In 2015, a local neighbourhood police officer in West Yorkshire ""became aware and revisited"" an outstanding warrant for McGrath. The officer referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which began extradition proceedings in 2016. McGrath´s lawyer, Daniel Martin, says it is difficult to understand what motivated ""this sudden need"" to get McGrath back to face trial. ""The victim was a police officer and obviously a request was made by his police force,"" he says. ""It seems this has been sat on some cabinet somewhere gathering dust until one day someone picked it up and decided it was imperative [McGrath] be extradited.""Under US law, people facing extradition are typically held in prison, except when there are ""special circumstances"" permitting their release. After McGrath´s arrest in May 2021, a judge granted bail, and said he presented no real flight risk or danger to the public. The judge also acknowledged that McGrath was at greater risk from Covid-19 due to respiratory complications, some of which related to time spent volunteering at the site of the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terror attacks. He was among the first to comb through the scene of destruction and it left a lasting impact. ""You´d walk into an office, there would be a coffee cup half-drunk, a doughnut with a bite taken out of it,"" he says. ""It was eerie.""Image caption, 2001: McGrath volunteered at the 9/11 wreckage site in New YorkAfter 15 months of house arrest - largely confined to his home on a quiet residential street in Pearl River, New York - McGrath was flown to the UK in July 2022. He spent seven months in HMP Leeds awaiting trial.  In February this year, a jury rejected the prosecution case and found McGrath not guilty. He had always maintained his innocence. According to local media, after McGrath was acquitted, the judge told jurors that he did not know why the case had been brought after so many years: ""We have worse things to deal with, if I can put it that way,"" he said.Martin says he has ""never seen such a flagrant waste of taxpayer resources as in this case"".  When McGrath was arrested in the US, courts in England and Wales were experiencing unprecedented delays and a backlog of cases that had grown during the pandemic.  Martin questions why prosecutors chose to ""spend so much money and time and effort bringing back Mr McGrath for an allegation, which by any standards was low on the Richter scale of assaults"".He claims the prosecution case was flawed. It relied in part on the assault victim identifying McGrath after a description had been circulated and he was in custody - a process which is no longer permitted. Several other witnesses had died or could not be found by police.CPS guidance states that extraditions should only be used where it is ""clearly appropriate and proportionate"".It maintains that assaults on police officers are a serious matter regardless of when they happened, and that it was right to put all the evidence before a jury: ""Two judges, including the trial judge, ruled that there was no abuse of process by the prosecution in this case."" West Yorkshire Police said its pursuit of McGrath was ""appropriate"" and a consequence of him ""deliberately avoiding the criminal justice process by failing to attend court at the time he was charged"".McGrath is now back with his family in the US. He says the case has had a ""devastating"" impact on his wife and sons. ""There are multiple victims here,"" he says. ""It´s been very stressful for everybody.""  He is slowly adjusting to life back home and attempting to put the ""pure hell"" of the past two years behind him.  ""It´s like Ground Zero - I don´t care to think about it, but it´s always going to be there.""Top Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished41 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, has been held in India since November 2017.He alleges the UK Intelligence Services ""tipped off"" their Indian counterparts despite the risk he could be tortured.In papers lodged at the High Court of Justice in response to Mr Johal´s legal claim, the UK government said the torture allegations were not admitted.It said they would be required to be heard in full in front of a judge. In Scotland, Mr Johal was an active blogger, highlighting historical human rights abuses and atrocities against Sikhs in the Punjab region.UK accused of tip-off that led to Brit´s tortureScot held in India faces murder conspiracy chargeBrit ´tortured to sign blank confession´ in IndiaHe was arrested in the Indian city of Jalandhar soon after his wedding, more than five years ago.The 36-year-old was shopping with his wife when his family say he was snatched from the street by plain-clothes officers of the Punjab Police and forced into an unmarked car. He says he was beaten and tortured by officers over the following days, and given electric shocks to his genitals, before being made to sign a blank confession document. These allegations have been denied by the Indian authorities.Mr Johal has remained in detention in a series of Indian prisons ever since, accused of funding the purchase of weapons used to assassinate a number of right-wing Hindu religious and political leaders in the Punjab.He denies the charges against him and says his arrest and trial is political.Image caption, Jagtar Singh Johal (right) arrives at court in India in November 2017Last year, the BBC revealed claims by investigators at the human rights organisation Reprieve that Mr Johal was arrested after information on him was passed by the UK Intelligence Services to their Indian counterparts. He is now suing the Foreign Office and other branches of the government saying this information ""caused or contributed"" to his mistreatment as well as the ""ongoing mental anguish"" he has endured facing a potential death sentence and execution in India.  The UK government has a longstanding policy of neither confirming nor denying public statements about the role of its intelligence services, but it has now responded formally to Mr Johal´s legal action and some of his allegations. In court papers, its lawyers write: ""For the avoidance of doubt, the allegations of torture and/or inhuman or degrading treatment by the Punjab Police… are not admitted.""And they say the UK government denies having ""caused, contributed to [or] legal responsibility for any personal injuries, loss or damage suffered by"" Mr Johal. The latest headlines from ScotlandMore stories from Glasgow and the West They make several references to Mr Johal having been visited by consular staff from the British High Commission in the days after his detention and appearing ""fine"", with ""no visible injuries"". They also say ""When asked about mistreatment [Mr Johal] said he wanted to discuss this at the next visit.""Mr Johal´s family and legal representatives believe this defence is at odds with public and other statements made by UK government officials on his case, and that material has been ""selectively quoted"". His brother Gurpreet Singh Johal said he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the UK government´s response to his brother´s legal claim. He told the BBC: ""For years, ministers and consular staff have been telling me they take Jagtar´s torture claims seriously and that there should be an independent investigation. ""So for the lawyers to question that, now that it´s come out that Britain´s intelligence services might have played a role in his abduction, is very hurtful."" Image source, Free Jaggi CampaignImage caption, Mr Johal got married in India in 2017In an email to Gurpreet in December 2017, a consular official wrote after a visit to Mr Johal: ""I just want to reassure you that this does not mean we take at face value that he told us he was well.""We are conscious that your brother is speaking in front of an Indian official and therefore is considering carefully what he says to us. We know that there is more to be said at the right opportunity.""The same official also wrote: ""At the end of my visit the official left the room to get the guard in. At this point Mr Johal whispered to me ´we need to talk about mistreatment, but not now, at a later stage´.""The human rights organisation Reprieve represents Mr Johal. Its director of policy and advocacy Dan Dolan said the UK government´s defence was ""alarming"" and used ""artful phrases"". He told the BBC: ""Government lawyers claims that he was looking fine are really disingenuous.""They don´t take into account the full context and frankly they look like an attempt from the government to defend itself from a legal claim rather than doing what is right on behalf of this British national.""In a statement a Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""Mr Johal´s allegations against the UK government are the subject of ongoing court proceedings and, as such, it would not be appropriate to comment.""Related TopicsForeign & Commonwealth OfficeHuman rightsDumbartonIndia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64951436,15,03,2023,bbc,uk

Abortion UK: Women 'manipulated' in crisis pregnancy advice centres - BBC News,"Image caption, BBC Panorama conducted undercover filming in three pregnancy crisis centres to see how they operateBy Eleanor Layhe & Divya TalwarBBC PanoramaWomen are being misled and manipulated about abortion by some crisis pregnancy advice centres in the UK, according to evidence from a Panorama investigation.The centres operate outside the NHS and tend to be registered charities. Most say they don´t refer women for abortions, but offer support and counselling for unplanned pregnancies. But the BBC´s investigation reveals more than a third of these services give misleading medical information or unethical advice, and sometimes both.Abortions have been available on the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales for more than 50 years. They have been legal in Northern Ireland since 2019.Pregnancy counselling is available through the NHS and regulated abortion providers, but searching online, Panorama identified 57 crisis pregnancy advice centres advertising.Most claim to provide a safe space for women to receive support and accurate information about their options.  The BBC decided to investigate after hearing from women who had been to these centres. One said she had been ""traumatised"" and that the centre had tried to ""manipulate"" her into not having an abortion. The Panorama team wanted to find out more, so contacted all 57, posing as women wanting advice about their options, including abortion.Of these, 34 directed us to the NHS website or regulated abortion providers. Some 21 centres gave misleading medical information and/or unethical advice about abortionSeven centres said having a termination could lead to ""post-abortion syndrome"" - a mental health condition likened to post traumatic stress disorder, which is not recognised by the NHSEight centres linked abortion to infertility and problems carrying future pregnancies to termFive centres linked abortion to an increased risk of breast cancerThe NHS says, like any medical treatment, there is a small risk something could go wrong, and that having an abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer, infertility, or mental health problems.Leading medic in the field of obstetrics, and director of an abortion provider, Dr Jonathan Lord, said women needed an ""informed choice"" which required ""good quality unbiased information"".During telephone and in-person consultations, Panorama was told: Women who have an abortion ""suffer emotional disturbances"" because ""they know they have been a mother, but they have no baby""They would suffer ""consequences"" after having an abortion and ""walk out of here a different person""Women who ""move on quickly"" after an abortion have done so because they have ""blocked out of their minds that it was a real baby""That it would be ""amazing"" to have ""your own child"" and asked how it would feel to ""actually hold your own baby""One centre said women could experience hallucinations involving babies crying and have ""nightmares of something happening to a child"" after an abortion. Jo Holmes, of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, said: ""From a professional-standards point of view... they are not there to advise, they are not there to guide, and they are... not there to give their opinion. This language is designed to make the client feel guilty.""Information and supportIf you need any help with the issues raised in this story, details of help and support can be found here.We wanted to find out more about how the centres operate so we went undercover.We visited the Crossroads Crisis Pregnancy Centre in Harrow, north-west London, which opened in 2005 and is based in a Baptist church. The centre´s website says its trained counsellors provide free and accurate information.  An undercover reporter told a counsellor she was three weeks pregnant, and asked what an abortion would involve at that stage. The counsellor replied: ""The baby is waiting for the pill to kill it and to get rid of it."" Listing depression and infertility as possible side effects, she added: ""There is no kind of safe thing because women have had the abortion and some will bleed to death, and all sorts of things happen.""The counsellor later said she was not telling the undercover reporter what to do about her pregnancy. Crossroads Pregnancy Advice Centre and the counsellor did not respond to Panorama´s request for comment. This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: Counsellor at Crossroads Pregnancy Advice Centre speaks to our undercover reporterWe also investigated the Tyneside Pregnancy Advice Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne. Its website says it has a ""Christian ethos"" and is committed to providing a caring, compassionate, and professional service. The centre is run by Dr Chris Richards who has anti-abortion views. He is also an NHS paediatrician. Our undercover reporter visited, saying she was married with two children and had discovered she was pregnant again. The adviser asked her what her children would think about her having an abortion. ""Would you be able to tell your daughters about having a termination? Or would it be something you´d always have to keep quiet about?"" she said. The reporter was handed a leaflet which said ""avoidance of children"" was a psychological risk. Asked what that meant, the counsellor replied: ""Having the termination and feeling like maybe you shouldn´t be around children as a result.""The counsellor added if the reporter wanted to have an abortion, she should consult the NHS website. Ms Holmes described the exchanges as extraordinary. ""It´s the woman´s experience and she´s just trying to manipulate the conversation to her end,"" she said. Dr Richards said: ""We have a 14-year track record of compliance with all our regulatory obligations and over 1,200 women have benefited from the work of our staff and volunteers."" He added that anyone who has read the centre´s website can see ""where they are coming from"". ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64751800,27,02,2023,bbc,uk
What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda? - BBC News,"Related TopicsEurope migrant crisisImage source, Getty ImagesThe UK government plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.The High Court has ruled the scheme is legal, but the decision is facing further challenges in the courts.What is the Rwanda asylum plan?The five-year trial will see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there.They may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda. If not, they can apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in a ""safe third country"". The government says this will deter people arriving in the UK through ""illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods"", such as on small boats which cross the English Channel.  However, the numbers crossing have not fallen since the policy was announced on 14 April 2022. More than 45,700 people used this route to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.Is the Rwanda scheme legal?Opponents argue that Rwanda is not a safe destination for asylum seekers and that the scheme breaks human rights laws. But in December the High Court ruled that the plan is legal. It said the Rwanda scheme does not breach the UN´s Refugee Convention.However, on 16 January, the High Court ruled that the some of the groups who lost the case have the right to appeal against parts of its decision. That means flights will not be able to take off to Rwanda while the case goes to the Court of Appeal. No date has been set.Ministers warned about Rwanda rights, court told Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinionHow many people could be sent to Rwanda?The UK government previously said ""anyone entering the UK illegally"" after 1 January 2022 could be sent, with no limit on numbers.Rwanda says it can process 1,000 asylum seekers during the trial period, but has capacity for more. Under the deal, Rwanda can also ask the UK to take in some of its most vulnerable refugees.  However, no asylum seeker has actually been sent to the country. The first flight was scheduled to go in June, but was cancelled after the legal challenges.Privilege Style - the airline which was scheduled to take asylum seekers to Rwanda - has said it will withdraw from its contract with the Home Office, following a campaign by refugee charities. How much will the plan cost?So far the UK has paid the Rwandan government £140m for the scheme.Other costs would include flights to Rwanda, food, accommodation, access to translators and legal advice. Removing people from the UK by charter flight cost more than £13,000 per person in 2020. When the policy was announced, former Home Office Minister Tom Pursglove said the cost would be ""similar to the amount of money we are spending on this currently"". He said that ""longer term, by getting this under control, it should help us to save money"". The UK´s asylum system costs £1.5bn a year. Almost £7m a day is spent on hotel accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. Critics say the daily cost is so high because of the time taken to decide on applications, and a ban on asylum seekers working while waiting for confirmation of their status.What is an asylum seeker?The UN Refugee Agency defines an asylum seeker as someone who has applied for shelter and protection in another country. A refugee is a person who has fled conflict or persecution in their own country. The legal rights of refugees are protected by international law. However, it is up to host countries to decide whether an asylum seeker is granted refugee status. In 2022, the UK received more than 74,700 asylum applications, the highest number for 20 years. Of these, more than 23,800 people and their dependants were granted a form of protection.

"Native UK plants in catastrophic decline, major report finds - BBC News","Related TopicsClimate changeImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Heather and gorse are two flora species native to the UKBy Georgina RannardBBC climate and science reporterParts of Britain´s landscape today would be unrecognisable to someone who grew up just 70 years ago, a major survey of plant life suggests.Non-native species have thrived while some native plants have been hit by modern agriculture and climate change. In a 20-year study, botanists counted more non-native than native species in the wild.Thousands of volunteers counted millions of flora to produce a Plant Atlas covering the UK and Ireland.Britain is now one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. That decline in biodiversity is also the subject of a new BBC documentary, Wild Isles, presented by Sir David Attenborough. One in every five plant species in the UK is listed as threatened.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harebells are native and found throughout the UKThe Plant Atlas 2020 is the third produced by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI). The findings are ""catastrophic"" for native species, explains Kevin Walker, head of science at the BSBI.""The loss of grasslands, heathlands and other habitats would be really shocking for someone brought up in the 1950s,"" he suggests.The survey also shows evidence for the first time of how climate change is affecting plant life, Dr Walker said.What is biodiversity?UK one of most nature-depleted in the worldFive takeaways from biodiversity summitThousands of volunteers recorded 3,445 plant species, of which 1,692 were native to Britain. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Corn marigold are becoming rarer to find in the wildBut 1,753 were non-native flora that compete with native species and can become invasive. They usually escape from gardens or are thrown away for taking up too much space, but thrive in the wild. They includes the American Skunk cabbage and Japanese Rose.The areas where half the recorded species naturally thrive has declined since the 1950s, the survey found. Heather, Alpine Lady-fern, and Devil´s-bit Scabious have decreasing ranges.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, American Skunk Cabbage is a non-native invasive species now found in the UKBut some species, including the Bee Orchid, Early Meadow-grass and Mossy Stonecrop, have expanded their ranges.Warmer temperatures further north means that some plants have been able to move into new areas where they can grow, but flora that live on top of mountains are dramatically declining as less snow falls.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Japanese Rose is popular in gardens but is not a native UK speciesThe decline in plant life is largely driven by increased use of land for intensive agriculture as well as pesticides in farming.These have removed land that flora grow on or altered the nutrient balance in soils.Insect, animal and human life depend on plants as pollinators must feed on flora and in turn help to produce food crops.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A variety of Bearberry -the Alpine Bearberry was found in northern ScotlandThe survey also found 10 new plants never before recorded, such as the Saltmarsh Sedge, an arctic plant found in Scottish saltmarshes. And some species were found to be more abundant than thought. That includes the shrub the Alpine Bearberry which was found in several new places after intensive recording in remote parts of northern Scotland.The most significant decline in flora was found in England followed by Scotland. Wales had the smallest reduction in species. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Wolfsbane is a native plant found throughout the UK - it is also very poisonousThe survey´s authors say that plants can be protected with stronger laws to safeguard natural sites and extension of plants´ natural habitats with sustainable land management. They also call for ""plant blindness"" to be addressed, suggesting that people be taught how to appreciate and understand the importance of flora.How the survey was conducted:8,500 volunteers visited 10x10km sites in 99% of the UK and Ireland to record flowering plants, ferns and charophytes Many sites were visited multiple times in different seasons to record varietyA total of 26 million records were made over 20 yearsThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Key moments from David Attenborough´s new BBC series, Wild IslesRelated TopicsPlantsBiodiversityClimate changeTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished40 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

UK visas: How does the points-based immigration system work? - BBC News,"Related TopicsBrexitImage source, Getty ImagesBy Tom EdgingtonBBC NewsThe government is adding five construction occupations to its list of jobs for which it´s easier to get a visa to come to the UK.The occupations include bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters.How many migrants come to the UK?In the year ending June 2022, just under 1.1m people came to the UK and an estimated 560,000 departed.That means net migration (the difference between people arriving and leaving) stood at just over 500,000.This represents a record high and an increase of 331,000 on the previous year (ending June 2021).The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which compiles the figures, said the rise was driven by non-EU migrants, specifically students, and the resumption of post-pandemic travel.It also said the war in Ukraine, the resettlement of Afghans and the new visa route for Hong Kong British nationals had all contributed.In October 2022, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said her ""ultimate aspiration"" was to reduce net migration to the UK to the ""tens of thousands"".Official immigration data gathering was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Estimates from June 2020 are based on different data sets and are not comparable with earlier years.What impact has Brexit had on immigration?Before Brexit, European Union and UK citizens had the freedom to live and work in any other EU country without needing a work visa.However, this freedom of movement came to an end on 1 January 2021.In the year ending June 2022, net EU migration was -51,000. This means more EU nationals left the UK than arrived.Net migration of non-EU nationals, on the other hand, was +509,000.There was a net increase of +45,000 British nationals. The ONS said this figure included some British nationals arriving from Hong Kong as well as those returning during the pandemic.Many Brexit supporters - including Ms Braverman - say leaving the EU has given the UK more control over migration policy.Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out restoring freedom of movement and says the UK must wean itself off ""immigration dependency"".However, the CBI - the UK´s biggest business group - says immigration is needed to solve worker shortages and boost economic growth.What are the current visa rules for economic migrants?Most people wanting to work in the UK have to apply for a visa through a points-based system (PBS).A points system was first adopted by the Labour government in 2008 and applied to migrants from non-EU countries. It was then overhauled by the Conservatives after the Brexit vote.The current PBS - which covers EU and non-EU migrants - was launched at the end of 2020. New ´simple´ UK immigration system launchesHow does the point-based system work?Applicants need enough points to qualify for a skilled worker visa.A total of 70 points is required. Attributes like: English skills; qualifications; and being under 26 all count towards the total.Having an offer of a skilled job from an approved employer and being able to speak English would give 50 points for example.A further 20 points would also be awarded if the applicant´s job pays at least £25,600 a year.There are some exceptions. Certain jobs in health or education, for example, will still award 20 points even if the salary is less than £25,600.The standard fee for a skilled visa is usually between £625 and £1,423.If granted, the visa will last for up to five years before it needs renewing.What is the ´shortage occupation list´?A ""shortage occupation list"" exists to help employers fill certain roles. These jobs have a lower salary threshold, making it easier for applicants to gain the required number of points.Jobs currently on the list include:care workersgraphic designersnursesvetsThe government updates the list based on advice from an independent group of experts - called the Migration Advisory Committee.At the Budget in March 2023, the government accepted the committee´s advice to add five construction sector occupations to the list:Bricklayers and masonsRoofers, roof tilers and slatersCarpenters and joinersOther construction and building tradesPlasterersThe government is also having a wider review of the list, which will conclude in autumn 2023.What about seasonal workers?Temporary work, like fruit picking, is covered by a seasonal worker visa.Up to 40,000 of these visas are issued each year. However, the National Farmers´ Union argues this number is too small and needs to increase to 70,000.Workers who are granted a visa must be paid at least £10.10 an hour.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Temporary work, like fruit picking, is covered by a seasonal worker visa.´It used to be easy to get fruit pickers´Can students and graduates come to the UK?There is no limit on international students coming to the UK under the student visa application system. However, Ms Braverman has suggested she wants to reduce the number of partners and children who come to the UK with students.Students who have already completed their degree can stay in the UK for two years under a graduate visa.World´s top graduates get new UK visa optionRelated TopicsUK immigrationImmigrationBrexitMigrationTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished41 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Silicon Valley Bank: Offer made for UK arm of failed US lender - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesAn offer has been made for the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) after it collapsed into administration, putting customer deposits at risk. A consortium of investors led by The Bank of London, a UK clearing bank, has submitted a formal bid to the Treasury. The government has been working ""at pace"" on a plan to support UK tech firms affected by the collapse of SVB.There have been warnings some could struggle to pay their staff from Monday without intervention.It comes as US customers have been told their deposits will be fully protected by the US government, putting pressure on the UK government to act. Earlier, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the BBC there was no risk to the UK´s financial system as a whole from the collapse of SVB, but ""there is a serious risk to some of our most promising companies in technology and life sciences"". Mr Hunt said he had been working with the prime minister and Bank of England governor ""through the weekend to come up with a solution"", and the government would bring forward a plan in the ""next few days"". However, Rachel Reeves, Labour´s shadow chancellor, urged the government to do more, warning UK start-ups needed to pay staff and maintain investor confidence.""We need, tomorrow morning, to hear from the government, how they are going to protect firms,"" she said.Faisal Islam: Is the UK right to bail out tech firms?SVB, which focuses on lending to technology companies, was shut down by US regulators on Friday in what was the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.The bank´s UK subsidiary will be put into insolvency from Sunday evening. This will allow individual depositors to be paid up to £85,000 from the UK´s deposit insurance scheme - however many have far more money than this saved with the bank. The government is looking for a buyer for the UK arm, with other lenders including Barclays and Oaknorth said to be mulling bids. As a clearing bank, the Bank of London does not lend and holds all of its deposits with the Bank of England. Its boss Anthony Watson said: ""Silicon Valley Bank cannot be allowed to fail given the vital community it serves. ""This is a unique opportunity to ensure the UK has a more diversified banking sector, whilst allowing continuity of service to SVB´s UK client base.""Image caption, Toby Mather, founder of Lingumi, says his firm is highly exposedMore than 200 bosses of UK tech companies signed a letter addressed to Mr Hunt on Saturday calling for government intervention.The letter, from Fintech Founders, said many financial technology firms did all of their banking with SVB ""and will therefore go into receivership imminently unless preventative action is taken"".""The firms affected by the collapse of SVB serve millions of people in the UK along with businesses that are critical to our economy,"" the letter said.""The cost of inaction here means that these firms could fail in the short-term and your technology growth ambitions will fail in the long-term.""Toby Mather, chief executive and co-founder of Lingumi, an education technology start-up, told the BBC his business was very exposed. ""85% of our cash is held in Silicon Valley Bank.. [So this] is a really existential threat to us because I´ve got to pay my employees and they´ve got kids and mortgages and so on."" One source in a tech firm told the BBC the situation could be ""pretty terminal"" for many UK start-ups. ""This Monday, at least 200 firms employing tens of thousands of people will find they can´t pay their staff or suppliers because the bank they had an account with has gone bust,"" the source said.Between 30% and 40% of UK start-ups employing up to 50,000 people could be affected by the collapse, the source added.Michael Moore, director general of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, said this was an ""urgent matter"" and that ""help is needed by tomorrow [Monday]"" for tech firms and entrepreneurs.SVB collapsed in the US after failing to raise $2.25bn (£1.9bn) to plug a loss from the sale of assets, mainly US government bonds, that were affected by higher interest rates. Its troubles prompted a run on the bank in the US and sparked investor fears about the general state of the banking sector.What went wrong at Silicon Valley Bank?Silicon Valley Bank specialised in lending to early-stage businesses, and the company served nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. It employs more than 8,500 people globally, with most of its operations in the US. But it has been under pressure as higher rates make it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales. More clients were withdrawing deposits in a trend that snowballed last week.Silicon Valley Bank UK, which has stopped making payments or accepting deposits, is officially expected to go into insolvency on Sunday evening.Related TopicsCompanies",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64934348,12,03,2023,bbc,uk
Public emergency alerts to be sent to all UK mobile phones - BBC News,"Image source, PA MediaImage caption, The alerts will initially focus on the most serious weather-related events, such as this flooding in YorkBy Aoife WalshBBC NewsA siren-like alert will be sent to mobile phone users across the UK next month to test a new government public warning system.It allows the government and emergency services to send urgent messages warning the public of life-threatening situations like flooding or wildfires.The test is expected to take place in the early evening of 23 April.Phone users will have to acknowledge the alert before they can use other features on their devices.A message will appear on the home screens of people´s devices during the test, with vibration and a loud warning sound that will ring for about 10 seconds, even if the phone is set to silent. The system - which became operational on Sunday - is being modelled on similar schemes used in the US, Canada, Japan and The Netherlands. Messages would only ever come from the government or emergency services and will initially focus on the most serious weather-related events, with the ability to get a message to 90% of mobile users within the relevant area.Terror alerts could be added to the list of potential events that would trigger a notification.The messages will include details of the area impacted and instructions about how to respond. They will only be sent where there is an immediate risk to life and many people may not receive an alert for months or years. Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden told the BBC the warnings are sent in a ""very targeted way"" and other than the test, he hopes many people will never hear the alert again.People can opt out by searching their device settings for emergency alerts and then turning off severe and extreme ones. Officials say the alerts could be life-saving, though, advising against switching them off.  Alerts ´can save a life´The Cabinet Office says the service will be secure, free to receive and will not collect personal information such as someone´s telephone number, identity or location.The new system uses cell broadcasting technology and messages will be based on someone´s current location - but location services do not need to be switched on to receive the alerts. That is because when an alert is triggered, all cell towers in a defined area will broadcast it, allowing the message to reach an area the size of an electoral ward.The government has released a video of what the alerts will sound like.Figure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsTrials have already been held in Reading and East Suffolk. People will also be alerted if they are in one of 19 other countries which currently use them. Mr Dowden, whose role as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster gives him oversight of the preparation and planning for emergencies, said the technology would ""revolutionise our ability to warn and inform people who are in immediate danger"".And he told the BBC´s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the alert is ""a sound that can save your life"". He said people are likely to hear the alert in instances where there has been a major flood and ""your house was at risk of being inundated and your life is at risk"".National Fire Chiefs Council chairman Mark Hardingham said the new system would help fire and rescue services to do their jobs ""and to help communities in the event of emergencies"".He said: ""We´ve seen this type of system in action elsewhere across the world and we look forward to having the facility here in the UK - by working together with fire services and partners, we want this system to help us to help you be as safe as you can if a crisis does hit.""The Environment Agency´s Caroline Douglas, executive director for flood and coastal erosion risk management, said the system would allow officials to communicate warnings in a ""timely and accurate manner"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64999417,19,03,2023,bbc,uk
Royal Navy Museum aims to keep Irishman Henry Kellett's flag in UK - BBC News,"Image source, The National Museum of the Royal Navy By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI education correspondentThe rare polar sledge flag of a ""proud Irishman"" and notable 19th Century naval officer could be lost to the UK.Born in County Tipperary, Capt Henry Kellett led two Arctic expeditions to search for Sir John Franklin´s lost ships.HMS Erebus and HMS Terror disappeared with all their crew and were not found for more than 160 years.The UK government had put a temporary export bar on a personal flag from the sledge Kellett used on the searches.It was valued at £120,000.The National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) is making what it said was a ""last-ditch"" attempt to raise the money to keep it in the UK.""It´s so important because there are only half a dozen of these surviving from this period in polar exploration,"" Prof Dominic Tweddle from the museum told BBC News NI.""The Art Fund, which is a funder of these kind of projects, have come in with £40,000.""The museum has another £40,000, so we´re £40,000 short.""The museum has obtained the backing of actor and writer Sir Michael Palin and broadcaster and historian Dan Snow for its attempt to acquire the flag.The age of Victorian explorationAccording to the Dictionary of Irish Biography, Capt Henry Kellett was born in Clonacody in November 1806.He joined the Royal Navy in 1822 and during his career sailed to Africa and South America.Image caption, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, as they appeared in Illustrated London NewsIn 1841 he was promoted to commander and served during the ""opium war"" in which British forces fought a trade war with China over the right to use Indian opium to buy Chinese goods.But it was during two searches for Franklin´s lost expedition that Kellett found fame as an explorer.Sir John Franklin led HMS Erebus and HMS Terror and 129 men on a voyage in 1845 to chart the Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic.The expedition´s disappearance shortly after became one of the great mysteries of the age of Victorian exploration.The British government sent a number of ships to search for the expedition from 1848 to 1859 without success.´Proud Irishman´Kellett led two searches, one aboard the famed HMS Resolute, which itself had to be abandoned in Arctic ice.Timbers from the ship were later used to make the Resolute desk, which is used by presidents of the United States in the White House´s Oval Office.HMS Erebus and HMS Terror were eventually found in Canada´s northern waters in 2014 and 2016.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, BBC´s Alpa Patel: ""the mission set sail in high spirits and hope but contact was lost two years later""Although Kellett had failed in his mission to find the ships he helped chart new routes through the Arctic.""During the search for Sir John Franklin´s lost 1845 expedition, Capt Kellett´s voyages helped map out the northern extremes of North America for Britain,"" said the UK government when announcing the export ban on his sledge flag.""The sledge flag, one of the earliest known in existence, helps to tell the story of British obsession in the 19th Century with arctic exploration and serves as an important reminder of the tragedy of Franklin´s failed voyage.""The UK government imposed an export bar on the flag in September 2022 to allow time for a UK gallery or institution to buy it at the recommended price of £120,000.Announcing the bar, the UK government described Kellett as a ""proud Irishman"" and a ""famous Arctic explorer"".But that export bar is due to expire in mid-March and the NMRN is trying to raise the full cost of buying the flag in order to display it at Portsmouth historic dockyards.Kellett served in the Royal Navy for almost half a century and died on 1 March 1875 at Clonacody in Tipperary where he was born.Related TopicsRepublic of IrelandRoyal NavyArcticTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished40 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

University strikes: Why staff across the UK are taking industrial action - BBC News,"Image source, BBC/Hazel ShearingTens of thousands of staff at 150 universities across the UK are continuing to strike, with several days of action in March. Academic staff are walking out, as are those in other roles including librarians, technicians, security staff and catering workers.The action is over pay, working conditions and pension cuts. When are UCU university staff striking?The University and College Union (UCU) initially announced 18 days of industrial action during February and March. It had called off seven of those dates after making what it described as ""significant progress across a range of issues"". A revised pay offer was made by employers in the dispute on pay, working conditions and pensions, but the union decided not to consult formally on it with its members. Three of the seven called off days of walkouts will still go ahead on: 20, 21 and 22 MarchThe union has said it will re-ballot staff at 150 universities about further strike action if there is no resolution.UCU staff also walked out in November 2022. Industrial action has been taking place at some universities since 2021.Which universities are involved?UCU members at 83 universities are striking over pay and working conditions, five are striking over pensions and 62 are striking over both issues. You can read the full list here.Unison members are striking on 20 and 21 March at Glasgow School of Art and Queen Margaret University and on 25 April at Arts University Bournemouth, after walking out in February.Unite and EIS have also been on strike but do not have any further dates scheduled.When are the next strikes and what pay do workers want?Are you affected by the dispute? Are lectures being cancelled?The Universities and College Employers Association (UCEA) says the strikes have caused ""low and isolated"" levels of disruption to students.Universities UK (UUK), which represents 140 institutions, said some universities have extended coursework deadlines and rescheduled teaching.If students feel the measures put in place aren´t good enough, they can use their university´s existing complaints procedure.The UCU says 70,000 staff have taken part in the strikes and they have been ""overwhelmed by the support of thousands of students"" who have joined picket lines. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Some students are supporting staff in their strike over pensions, pay and conditionsWhy are university staff striking?Most staff are striking over pay and conditions. For the 2022-23 pay round, the unions have asked for:a pay rise worth either the RPI measure of inflation +2%, or 12% - whichever is higheraction to end the use of zero hours and temporary contracts.The unions said they were offered an improved pay deal for 2023-24 worth between 5% and 8% on 25 January, but this was a real-terms ""pay cut"".The UCEA said it would begin implementing that 2023-24 pay uplift in March, despite talks stalling without an agreement on pay.The UCU said progress had been made ""across a range of subjects"". Further talks are scheduled in March, although these will not involve discussions on pay.Some UCU members are also striking over pensions.The dispute over pensions began more than a decade ago, but was reignited by the revaluation of the pension scheme used by academic staff - the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). The UCU says this valuation was ""flawed"" because it took place at the start of the pandemic, ""when global markets were crashing"", and recorded a deficit of £14.1bn. Changes were introduced which meant pension contributions increased and future benefits were reduced.According to the UCU, the average member ""will lose 35% from their guaranteed future retirement income"".It says the scheme was more recently found to have a surplus of £1.8bn and is demanding that employers restore staff pension benefits. How much do lecturers get paid?Every year, a committee including trade union and employer representatives meets and decides on any changes to university workers´ pay.  Most universities opt in to the negotiations, but they don´t have to - they can make their own decisions. The 22/23 pay scale was implemented in August 2022. The median salary for a professor is around £80,000, according to analysis of Higher Education Statistics Agency figures carried out by the UCEA employers´ body. Some 25% of professor salaries are at or below around £70,000, the UCEA says.However, the UCU says a third of academic staff are on temporary contracts and are paid hourly. It says that casual staff only get holiday entitlement based on the hours they work and have inadequate paid time to prepare for their classes. Staff titles vary across institutions, and universities employ staff on different types of temporary contracts. Some academics say their salary is substantially less than the figures quoted.What do university employers say?The UCEA says any increase in pay ""puts jobs at risk"". Some 30% of universities are already in deficit.It says the January 2023 offer is the highest HE pay offer made in nearly 20 years and was ""a genuine attempt by employers to address cost of living pressures"".On pensions, Universities UK said it is working with the UCU ahead of the next pension scheme valuation. It said that without the changes in pension benefits which have been introduced, employees would have had to pay much more in contributions.Correction 25 January 2023: This article was amended with revised figures for professors´ salaries after clarification from the UCEA.

"UK budget worth extra £320m to Scotland, Hunt says - BBC News","Image source, UK ParliamentThe UK budget will be worth an additional £320m to the Scottish government over the next two years, the chancellor has said.Jeremy Hunt said the money would be on top of £1.5m of funding for the Cloddach Bridge in Moray and £8.6m for Edinburgh´s festivals. Mr Hunt said one of the UK´s 12 new Investment Zones would be in Scotland.He did not announce any funding for the Acorn carbon capture project in Aberdeenshire.But he did confirm that alcohol duty would ""go up in line with inflation in the usual way"" in a move the Scotch Whisky Association described as a ""hammer blow"" to the industry as it would raise duty on a bottle of Scotch by 10.1%.The only exception to the hike in alcohol will be for drinks sold on draught in pubs, where from August the duty charged will be up to 11p lower than it is on products sold in supermarkets.Many of the chancellor´s budget measures, including the expansion of free childcare in England to one and two-year-olds, do not apply in Scotland but the Scottish government receives additional money through the Barnett formula.The Scottish Conservatives have urged the Scottish government to match the childcare expansion, saying it would be a ""huge boost for families and the economy"".Budget 2023: Key points at-a-glanceWhat the Budget means for you and your moneyHunt aims to get parents and over-50s back to workChildren aged three and four in Scotland currently get 1,140 hours of free childcare a year.Deputy First Minister John Swinney described the the spring Budget statement as ""another missed opportunity"" to help households, businesses and public services through the cost-of-living crisis.He added that the additional money for the Scottish government´s budget was welcome but will ""not go far enough and in the long-term our capital funding will fall in real-terms"".Which measures affect Scotland?Among the measures that will apply UK-wide are an extension of the Energy Price Guarantee until June, which the government says will save the average family £160 a year and give certainty over their bills. The chancellor announced the government will also pay the childcare costs of parents on universal credit moving into work or increasing their hours upfront, rather than in arrears - removing a major barrier to work for those who are on benefits.The maximum they can claim will also be boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children - an increase of around 50%. Image source, Getty ImagesThe planned 11p rise in fuel duty will be cancelled and the 5p cut will be maintained for another twelve months, saving a typical driver another £100 on top of the £100 saved so far since last year´s cut, the Chancellor said.He also set out a plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack Alister said he had tried to lobby against the increase in alcohol duty but had not been successful.He added that it was a ""matter of regret that whisky duty, spirits duty is going up, it´s not what I wanted for the Scottish industry.""´Fall in living standards´Mr Swinney said Mr Hunt had failed to deploy the full range of powers available to him to mitigate the impact of soaring energy prices and high inflation.He said: ""While reversal of the planned increase in the energy price guarantee is welcome, with the end of the energy bills support payments, average household monthly bills will still rise by almost a third in April, at a time when wholesale energy costs are falling.""Rising interest rates combined with reduced support means some people are expected to experience a larger fall in living standards this coming year than they have over the last 12 months.""An uplift on universal credit and extending this to legacy benefits would have made a meaningful difference to households struggling to make ends meet.""Related TopicsScottish governmentJohn SwinneyJeremy HuntTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished41 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Vitiligo: Controversial skin cream may come to UK - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Model Winnie Harlow felt isolated when first diagnosed with vitiligo but now says it´s one of her ""greatest gifts""By Michelle RobertsDigital health editorA controversial new treatment for a condition called vitiligo that can restore pigment to the skin might soon be offered on the NHS, if UK experts approve it. Some call ruxolitinib a miracle cream because it can return skin´s natural colour and get rid of whitened patches. But it carries some potentially serious side effects. Others question whether vitiligo should be celebrated rather than masked or corrected.Ruxolitinib (brand name Opzelura) must be prescribed by a doctor because the treatment requires monitoring. Risks and benefitsIt can affect the body´s immune system, which might leave users more prone to infections such as coughs and colds, for example.A stronger pill formulation of the same drug is already used to treat some cancers.In trials of the cream for vitiligo, some users developed acne and redness affecting the area of skin where it was applied. But it was an effective treatment for nonsegmental vitiligo - the most common type - where patches or blotches of depigmentation appear on both sides of the body. About half of those who used it twice a day experienced a significant improvement, and about one in six had almost a complete repigmentation within three months. The list price for a tube is $2,000 (£1,660) in the US, where it is already approved for use. European regulators look set to recommend it too, for people aged 12 and over.  What is vitiligo and what causes it?Vitiligo is thought to be an autoimmune condition where the person´s own body starts attacking cells in the skin that make protective pigment. This causes visible whitened patches or blotches which are prone to sun damage. Vitiligo affects everyone, but is more noticeable in people with skin of colour. It is not infectious or contagious.Experts say living with vitiligo can be psychologically devastating, causing anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and even suicidal thoughts.Vitiligo: The shame and stigma in South Asian communities´Inclusive Barbies are a major step in my life´Dr Viktoria Eleftheriadou from the British Association of Dermatologists, says some people with vitiligo may feel like they have lost their ethnic identity.She said: ""The risk of this can be higher among people of colour, as the condition is more noticeable in people with darker skin tones.""She says it would be good to offer people the choice of a treatment.Winnie Harlow, one of the world´s most recognisable models, has embraced having vitiligo rather than trying to hide her patches - although she has said she found living with it as a child ""incredibly isolating"". ""I vividly recall being in third grade and trying to befriend two girls who would run away from me because their mothers didn´t want them to ´catch´ what I had, as if I were contagious,"" she told Cosmopolitan magazine. She now describes her skin condition as one of her ""greatest gifts"". ""It has taught me, from the time I was a little girl, to use it as a megaphone: to be louder, prouder, and always fuelled by passion and love. It´s helped me look beyond my own cover - and everyone else´s, too.""Emma Rush, founder and chief executive of Vitiligo Support UK, says while it is great to see models raising public awareness, ""there is a gap between the average model and the average person on the street"".She says many people find having vitiligo on your face can be particularly distressing. ""My face is now covered with it. I don´t recognise old pictures of myself from before I had it. It´s like I was a different person. ""I can wear make-up to cover it but I can´t just walk around unnoticed without it. It helps with that first encounter so people don´t stare.""When it starts on the face it is often around the mouth and eyes and those are the parts that people look at. It can be catastrophic experience in a society that is focused on appearances.""Having a condition that can turn your skin white is not just impacting your skin colour, either. When your appearance changes, it can come with a whole raft of assumptions about where you come from and who you are. ""Some people say they feel like they have lost a depth of their identity or had something taken away from them by the disease.""She says having it as a new treatment option would be ""an absolute godsend"". Teacher Joti Gata-Aura was diagnosed with vitiligo in her early 20s. At that time, she says, she would have been willing to try almost anything to remedy it. Image source, Joti Gata-AuraImage caption, Joti Gata-Aura has written a book about living with vitiligo and building self-confidence""I battled with it for a very, very long time. I was constantly searching for treatments,"" she said. ""I hadn´t accepted the skin I was in.""""I´m Indian. I have brown skin - I´m not a fair-skinned Asian person. So when I had vitiligo I stood out. I covered up my skin for many, many years. ""I hid my skin so much.""Now aged 45, her outlook has changed and she campaigns about body positivity and mentors young people to help them with self-confidence.   ""I´ve done so much work on being happy in the skin you are in and being confident in who you are.""She says identity is still a big issue. ""My identity was stripped when I lost my pigment. It´s taken so long for me to accept this white skin.""It does, for me, add the extra layer of having to... not justify myself, but explain who I am, and that can sometimes be quite difficult, especially now that my skin is whiter than some of my English friends. That´s difficult because I am proud of my background and culture.""She said people needed to make their own choices about living with vitiligo. ""It might not be a disability, it might not be an illness, but people psychologically have been ripped apart because of this condition.""I think it is so important that, while I´m in a good place right now, I wasn´t in a good place when I was diagnosed. People are going through what I went through 20 years ago. This could be light at the end of the tunnel for many people.""Current treatments for vitiligo that result in a return of patients´ natural skin colour are limited and have variable effectiveness, which means that if one treatment worked well for one patient it might not work for another at all, says the British Association of Dermatologists. The most commonly used ones - phototherapy, tacrolimus and topical corticosteroids - can all have their downsides. For example, there are side effects associated with the long-term use of strong topical steroids, and phototherapy sessions usually require repeat trips to hospital for several months.Ruxolitinib would need to be approved by the drug regulator, the MHRA, to be sold or prescribed in the UK. The advisory body NICE is planning to assess its merits and risks and whether the cost can be justified for the NHS to provide to patients.

NI Protocol: UK and EU appear to be on brink of new Brexit deal - BBC News,"Related TopicsBrexitImage source, EPABy Chris Mason & Andre Rhoden-PaulPolitical editor, BBC NewsThe UK and the European Union appear to be on the brink of completing a new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.A No 10 source describes the negotiations as ""positive"".Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said on Saturday that a deal was not yet done on the protocol but was ""inching towards a conclusion"". There had been plans for King Charles to meet the president of the European Commission in the UK on Saturday, the BBC understands.Multiple sources said the visit by Ursula von der Leyen was cancelled due to operational reasons unconnected to the political talks.The planned meeting between the King and European Commission president, originally reported by Sky News, was not part of the negotiations between the UK and the EU.But the fact a meeting was planned is significant as it appears to indicate a Brexit deal was about to be done - and publicly presented - while Ms von der Leyen was in the UK.It is not known when she will now come to the UK.Some had suggested a new deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol - thought to be all but complete - could be called the Windsor Agreement and include a moment in front of the cameras involving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Ms von der Leyen.The protocol, which was agreed under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and came into force in 2021, saw Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU laws to get round the need for checks at the UK´s border with the Republic of Ireland.Analysis: DUP´s moment of truth fast approachingBrexit: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol?Negotiators clear diaries as Brexit deal in sightMr Sunak and Ms von der Leyen spoke by telephone on Friday and Downing Street said the prime minister had made ""good progress"". A source said afterwards that it had been ""positive"" and negotiations would continue, with the leaders agreeing ""to discuss this further in coming days.""Both the UK and the EU have to co-ordinate diaries to make the choreography of an announcement work at a mutually convenient time and place.Mr Varadkar told reporters: ""There is the possibility of agreement in the next few days but by no means guaranteed... there´s still a gap to be closed.""He said there was ongoing engagement between the UK government, European Commission and Northern Ireland parties, urging them to ""go the extra mile"" to reach an agreement as the benefits were ""huge"". Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has pulled out of a long-planned trip to the Middle East at the beginning of next week - raising expectations that a formal announcement from the UK and Brussels could be days away.But there have been repeated delays over the past week or so, as wrangling went on between No 10, the Democratic Unionist Party and Conservative backbenchers.The prime minister has been trying to win support for changes to the controversial protocol. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol?The Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks.Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries. The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland´s troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability.The UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday agreement - was an absolute priority.So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.It is now part of international law. Learn more about it here.Earlier, a source from the DUP told the BBC they had not been involved in any talks with the prime minister on Friday and had no meetings scheduled over the weekend.Mr Sunak has been trying to win over the DUP to a deal, as the party is currently blocking the formation of devolved government in Northern Ireland.Sammy Wilson MP, the DUP´s shadow spokesperson for Brexit, said his party would only accept a deal if EU law ""imposed"" on Northern Ireland was removed. He told Sky News: ""If the prime minster succeeds in getting that we will embrace it, but if he hasn´t succeeded in achieving that aim then as part of the UK we cannot accept it.""Mr Wilson said that ""we expect British law should apply in Northern Ireland, not Brussels law imposed on us, with all the disastrous effects that has.""The prime minister has been facing pressure from some Conservative MPs over Northern Ireland´s current obligation to follow some EU laws and be accountable to the European Court of Justice. Eurosceptic Tory MP Sir John Redwood said: ""The UK needs to hold out over the EU imposing laws on Northern Ireland. The EU needs to get the Unionists on side.""Related TopicsNI BrexitBrexit",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64765375,25,02,2023,bbc,uk
UK microchip firms ask government for hundreds of millions - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Semiconductors, or microchips, are used to control electronic devicesBy Jonty Bloom and Will SmaleBusiness reportersThe boss of one of the UK´s leading microchip firms is calling for the government to invest ""hundreds of millions"" in the sector.Millions of products from cars to washing machines and mobiles rely on microchips also called semiconductors.Scott White, of Pragmatic Semiconductor, said without a huge funding boost UK firms will go abroad.The government said it would soon publish its strategy to improve access to skills, facilities and tools.It comes as a new report says the UK government ""must act now to secure the future of the vital UK semiconductor industry"".What was the chip shortage all about?Mr White, Pragmatic´s chief executive, said the government ""can´t just spend a few tens of millions of pounds"" on the semiconductor sector, as ""that isn´t enough to move the needle"".""It has to be hundreds of millions, or even more than £1bn, to make a substantive difference,"" he said.""It is not about unfair subsidies, it is about having a level playing field with other countries around the world.""Mr White said that other governments were ""investing substantially"" in their microchip industries, and that the UK had to follow suit.Pragmatic Semiconductor employs 200 people across its headquarters in Cambridge and at two production sites in Country Durham. Mr White added that while the company wanted to keep manufacturing in the UK, ""that only makes sense if the economies are justified compared to elsewhere"".Image source, PragmaticImage caption, Scott White says the UK industry just wants a ""level playing field""A joint report published on Thursday by the Institute of Physics (IOP) and the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAE) found ""skills shortages, high costs and low public awareness threaten the UK´s position in the vital semiconductor race"".The study follows a global shortages of microchips in recent years temporarily halted production of everything from games consoles to cars.The IOP and RAE are calling for financial support for the sector in the UK.They also want to see more children encouraged to study sciences at school, to help increase the number of qualified potential employees, and highlighting the importance of the sector.The report - entitled UK Semiconductor Challenges and Solutions - also calls for the government to release its long-awaited national semiconductor strategy. This has now been two-years in the making. The IOP´s director of science, innovation and skills, Louis Barson, said the UK cannot simply rely on importing the microchips it needs.He said: ""We need a strong homegrown semiconductor industry, and that is critical to our economic security and physical security."" More BBC news and features on global tradeThe UK´s semiconductor sector is valued at $13bn (£11bn), according to one recent estimate. That might sound like a lot, but the global industry is said to be worth $580bn (£490bn).Meanwhile, a parliamentary report last autumn said that the UK only produced 0.5% of the world´s semiconductors.The IOP says that there are currently 40 or so semiconductor firms in the UK, with 25 doing manufacturing work. And it estimates that the total workforce is around 11,400 people.There have recently been some worrying signs for the industry in the UK.Last week, the UK´s top chip-designer Arm announced that it would be listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange instead of London´s. The news came despite UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak meeting with bosses from Arm´s parent company, Japan´s SoftBank.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Arm is due to list its shares in New York rather than LondonIn addition, another UK chip firm, IQE, has already warned that it might have to relocate abroad without more government support for the sector.All this comes against a backdrop of big overseas government investment in the semiconductor sectors. Last summer, the White House announced that it would invest $50bn in the industry in the US over five years, $29bn in boosting production, and $11bn in research and development.It is a similar picture in the European Union, with Brussels planning to invest €43bn ($46bn; £38bn).""Other countries are continuing to invest significantly in their own semiconductor industries, and the UK will fall behind without timely government action and a coherent strategy,"" said Prof Nick Jennings, chairman of the RAE´s engineering policy centre committee.In addition to the matter of funding, the IOP and RAE want the government to confirm that it will proceed with its proposed plan to set up a national body for the sector, a so-called ""semiconductor institute"".""Crucially it could speak for the sector, provide a coordinated voice that would allow the industry to present a united front,"" said Mr Barson.A government spokesman said: ""Our forthcoming semiconductor strategy will set out how the government will improve the sector´s access to the skills, facilities and tools it needs to grow. The strategy will be published in due course.""Related TopicsCambridgeGlobal tradeSemiconductorsTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished41 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

UK Weather: Snow and ice warnings extended to more parts of UK - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Weather for the Week AheadBy James FitzGerald & Jemma CrewBBC NewsWarnings of snow and ice have been extended to many parts of the UK over the coming days.Yellow weather warnings remain in place for parts of north-east Scotland and England until Wednesday morning.The Met Office issued a slew of further yellow warnings on Monday which cover much of the UK during the next five days.Heavy snow could bring ""significant disruption"" to northern and central parts on Thursday and Friday, it said.Forecasters say a ""major change"" is under way as Arctic air sweeps in from the north, bringing snow, ice and plunging temperatures for many.A fresh warning of ice and some snow across areas of the Midlands, East, south of England and Wales comes into force between 21:00 GMT tonight and 10:00 on Tuesday.This could lead to ""difficult travel conditions"" in some parts, the Met Office said.Some roads and railways were likely to be affected in these areas, it said, and people should expect longer journey times.A similar warning covering much of Northern Ireland is also in place overnight.Snow is likely to cause some travel disruption across parts of southern England and Wales throughout Wednesday, according to another warning. Further warnings for heavy snow are in place for Thursday and Friday in much of Scotland, northern England, parts of the Midlands, north Wales and Northern Ireland.Weather conditions may disrupt travel and other day-to-day activities, with more alerts likely to be issued.The first Met Office warning began on Sunday evening for parts of Scotland, covering places including Aberdeen and Dundee, the Highlands, Orkney and Shetland.The warning in place on Monday encompasses more of Scotland and a corridor of north-east England that extends to Newcastle upon Tyne and Yorkshire.For Tuesday, the area grows further to cover Strathclyde, more of Yorkshire and the Humber, and the East Midlands. Frequent snow is expected, with northern Scotland experiencing frequent and often heavy snow showers on Monday afternoon.The Met Office said snow could cause delays on roads in these places, as well as rail and plane cancellations. It also warned of the risk of slips and falls on icy surfaces. There was ""slight chance"" that rural communities could be cut off, it said, adding that cuts to power and phone services were possible.Find out if snow or ice are forecast where you areCheck if the Met Office warnings cover your areaGetting colder - but is it a Beast from the East?What does an unheated room do to your body?Tuesday night may prove to be the coldest of the year so far, when the temperatures could fall as low as -15C in some sheltered Scottish glens.Some uncertainty surrounds Wednesday, when a ""battleground"" is expected to be set up as milder Atlantic air from the south meets colder Arctic air from the north.BBC forecaster John Hutchinson said it would be ""a very cold start to March"", with many areas likely to see snow at some point.In some areas, this may only but a small amount, with the heaviest snowfall likely to be in northern Scotland over the next few days, he added. On Thursday and Friday, he said snow may become ""a bit more widespread in central and northern Britain"" and flurries may be ""fairly persistent"".There could be drifting and some disruption to travel and power, he added.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has extended its level three cold weather alert to all of England, with the warning in place from 01:00 on Monday to midnight on Thursday.This means there is a 90% chance of severe cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow. The agency said this could have a ""serious impact"" on the health of those who are vulnerable to cold weather, and urged people to check on relatives.It advised over-65s, or those with pre-existing medical conditions, to heat their homes to at least 18C.How is the cold weather affecting you?

Taxpayers spent £10.5m on fees for diplomats' children at UK schools - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eton College is seen as the most prestigious private school in EnglandBy Ione WellsPolitical correspondentThe Foreign Office spent £371,827 sending the children of top diplomats to Eton in 2021/22, official figures obtained by Labour have revealed. The Eton figure represents 3.5% of the £10.54m spent by the government on UK private schools last year.The boarding school subsidies are for top diplomats who may be posted abroad at short notice.The Foreign Office says it wants to ensure children don´t have their education disrupted if their parents have to leave the country.In the same year, £21.38m was spent on school fees for 902 UK diplomats´ children in education overseas. Under the longstanding scheme - called the Continuity of Education Allowance - senior Foreign Office staff can apply to have up to 90% of their children´s school fees paid by the taxpayer if they contribute the remaining 10% themselves.A total of 531 children had their education subsidised at UK schools in 2021/22.State and private schools cash gap doubles - studyPrivate school tax breaks inexcusable, says LabourPrivate schools say abolition would be vote-loserIn the last academic year, the maximum amount that could be claimed for secondary pupils to board at schools was set at £11,814 per term, equivalent to £35,442 per year. ´Put out´Ten children subsidised to attend Eton College last year did so at a total cost of £371,827 - an average of £37,182, about 5% higher than the maximum allowance.We asked the Foreign Office why the average amount spent at Eton appears to be higher than the cap but they did not give an explanation for the discrepancy.The figures were obtained through Freedom of Information requests by Labour´s shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry.James Roberts, managing director of the TaxPayers´ Alliance campaign group, said: ""Hard-pressed taxpayers will feel put out by these figures. ""While it´s understandable that diplomats want the best education for their kids, we don´t need to subsidise sending their children to our most elite public schools. ""Diplomats should expect to send their children to one of our brilliant state schools, like everybody else does, or pay private school fees themselves.""The maximum amounts in 2021/22 diplomats could claim for children included £11,814 per term for ""senior boarder"" fees, £8,270 for ""senior day school"" fees, £10,385 for ""junior boarder"" fees, and £7,629 for ""junior day"" fees.´Academic development´Labour´s Freedom of Information request showed the amounts spent by the government at the 10 UK private schools where the most places were funded in 2021/22.  These included £629,073 spent on 23 pupils at Sevenoaks School, in Kent, and £381,851 on 11 pupils to Oundle School, in Northamptonshire. In its current form, the allowance dates back to 1996.

How is the UK stopping Channel crossings and what are the legal routes to the UK? - BBC News,"Related TopicsCalais migrant crisisImage source, Getty ImagesNew plans to tackle small-boat crossings have been set out by the government.It follows large increases in the number of migrants crossing the Channel.What is the government´s new plan?Under the Illegal Migration Bill:the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another ""safe"" third countrymigrants would not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detentionunder-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country they are being removed to would be able to delay departurepeople removed from the UK would be blocked from returning, or seeking British citizenship in futurethere is a cap on the number of refugees the UK will settle through ""safe and legal routes""The law would apply retrospectively, with anyone arriving illegally from Tuesday 7 March at risk of deportation. Sunak says he is up for the fight on migrant boatsCan asylum seekers currently reach the UK legally?It is already illegal for migrants to knowingly enter the UK without a visa or special permission.People who do so can be jailed for up to four years and removed to a safe country. However, between June and November fewer than 100 people who crossed in small boats were arrested.The UK also has an international legal duty to not criminally penalise anyone seeking protection as a refugee. How many people cross the Channel in small boats?What are the ""safe and legal"" routes to claim asylum in the UK?The Home Office says there are a number of ""safe and legal"" routes to the UK. However, some are only available to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, or British National status holders in Hong Kong.Other asylum routes only accept a limited number of refugees:UK Resettlement Scheme - prioritises those from regions in conflict. It planned to resettle 5,000 in its first year, but resettled 1,125Community Sponsorship Scheme - for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees. In 2021, 144 people used this routeRefugee Family Reunion - for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK. In 2021, 6,134 visas were grantedMandate Resettlement Scheme - to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home. The scheme has resettled about 430 refugees since 2004, but just two people in 2021Organisations including the Refugee Council and Amnesty International says there are no safe and legal routes for most people to seek asylum in the UK. What does international law say about refugees?Critics of the government´s latest asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they break international law. The UN´s refugee agency the UNHCR told the BBC the plans were ""very concerning"", and would block even those with compelling asylum claims. In a letter to MPs, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said there is a ""more than 50% chance"" that the new bill is incompatible with international law.The 1951 Refugee Convention is an international agreement outlining the rights of refugees around the world. The main principle of the Refugee Convention states that refugees should not be returned to a country where they faced threats to life or freedom. The government argues that its Rwanda plan is in line with international law because it´s a safe third country. The Nationality and Borders Act changed the law so that asylum seekers in the UK could be rejected if it can be shown they passed through a safe third country before reaching the UK. But this has no basis in the Refugee Convention. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a commitment to protect human rights signed by Council of Europe members. It is part of UK law under the Human Rights Act.The ECHR protects the same rights of refugees as the Refugee Convention. It commits signatories like the UK against sending asylum seekers to countries where their lives may be at risk. Will this migrant bill become a reality?The row over the Migration Bill is just beginning What has the government already said it will do about small boats?Prime Minister Rishi Sunak previously set out plans to reduce numbers crossing:a new Small Boats Command Centre bringing together the military and National Crime Agency (NCA)increased funding for the NCA to address immigration crimemore raids on people suspected of working illegally moving up to 10,000 migrants into disused university halls and holiday parks to save on hotel costsThe government also pledged to abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by end of 2023. It later said this only covers the 92,601 initial asylum decisions from claims made before June 2022.The government also announced a new agreement with Albania to place more UK Border Force staff in its capital Tirana, and to fast track the return of failed asylum seekers. In November, a £63m deal was signed with France to pay for additional French officers patrolling the Channel and more use of drones. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The government has promised better cooperation between the agencies responsible for immigrationWhat happens when people arrive in the UK?Most people arriving by boat claim asylum on arrival in the UK. An asylum seeker is a person who has applied for the right to seek shelter and protection in another country.Asylum seekers have an initial interview and - if their case is accepted - they can apply to remain in the UK.However, asylum claims from 28 June 2022 can be rejected if the applicant has a connection to a safe third country. This includes passing through France. The Home Office says applicants should receive a decision within six months, but in the year to June 2022 70% had not heard back within that time. Asylum seekers usually cannot work while their case is considered.If their application for asylum is accepted, they can stay in the UK. If rejected, they face being returned to the country they came from, but can appeal.Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government´s ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.Related TopicsCalais migrant crisisSuella BravermanEnglish ChannelRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakEurope migrant crisisRight of asylumRwandaMigrationTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished40 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished19 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

Sunak and Macron summit: UK to give £500m to help France curb small boat crossings - BBC News,"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, The UK PM looks to reset UK-France relations as he meets Emmanuel Macron in Paris.By Damian Grammaticas & Kate WhannelBBC NewsThe UK will give France almost £500m over three years to help stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats.The cash was announced at a summit in Paris between UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and President Emmanuel Macron, who said France would also contribute.The money will go towards an extra 500 officers and a new detention centre in France, but this will not be fully operational until the end of 2026. The UK had planned to pay France around £63m this year to tackle the problem.This new package appears to at least double that amount, with the UK pledging £120m in 2023-24.France will also step up its funding of enforcement but has not said by how much.Labour´s shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry accused the Conservatives of ""lurching from one crisis to another with nothing more than their typical sticking plaster politics"".""Before Rishi Sunak sends even more money to the French authorities to tackle this crisis, he needs to explain what was achieved by the hundreds of millions we´ve given them before, and why small boat crossings continued to go up regardless.""Follow live: Sunak and Macron summit in ParisHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Will this migrant bill become a reality?Mr Macron praised the joint efforts of UK and French teams working to reduce small boat crossings.Speaking at a press conference with Mr Sunak at the Elysee Palace, he said the team had prevented 30,000 small boat crossings and made 500 arrests in the past year.Mr Sunak said the money would help ""put an end to this disgusting trade in human life"". He added: ""Working together, the UK and France will ensure that nobody can exploit our systems with impunity.""Mr Sunak said the new deal agreed by the two leaders will see 500 extra French law enforcement officers using ""enhanced technology"" such as drones to prevent Channel crossings.The money will also go towards a new detention centre in France, adding to the 26 already in existence. Downing Street said the detention centre would allow more migrants ""to be removed from the French coast"".Mr Sunak has made stopping the boats one of his key pledges for his government.However, if the centre is completed on that timetable it would not fully functioning before an election is due in the UK, which can be held no later than January 2025.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, ´We have to work together to dismantle traffickers´ - MacronBoth men said the summit in Paris marked a new beginning in Anglo-French relations. Mr Macron said it was a ""moment of reconnection"" while Mr Sunak described the meeting as an ""entente renewed"". The French leader had no qualms about putting his finger on what he thought had led the relationship into difficulties in recent years - Brexit.Between the lines of his statement, that was a criticism of Mr Sunak´s three predecessors as UK prime minister and the tensions all have had with the EU.During their press conference, the two leaders presented a strong sense of comradery - Mr Macron addressed ""dear"" Rishi, who in turned thanked ""mon ami"", and the briefing concluded with an embrace.However, it is clear this meeting was just the start of something more cooperative - a small step, no more.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, A group of migrants brought to Dungeness in Kent, after being rescued by the RNLILast year saw a huge increase in the number of people trying to get the UK by crossing the English Channel in small, often flimsy boats.For Mr Sunak, this is a domestic political issue. At the start of 2023, he said tackling small boats was one of his priorities. He needs to see a reduction in boats reaching the UK in order to fulfil his pledge. Mr Macron also wants to see the movements reduced - but for him the issue is one that has broader implications. He wants European countries to look at the routes people take to reach western Europe. Earlier this week, Mr Sunak unveiled a new Illegal Migration Bill.Under the plans, anyone found to have entered the UK illegally would not only be removed within 28 days, but also be blocked from returning or claiming British citizenship in future.Mr Sunak argues his new plan was ""designed to break the business model of the criminal gangs and remove the pull factors, bringing them to the Channel coasts"".However, the bill has been fiercely criticised by some charities and the UN´s refugee agency. It is also likely to face legal challenges. Related TopicsEnglish ChannelEmmanuel MacronRishi Sunak",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64916446,10,03,2023,bbc,uk
Russia threatens to destroy Ukraine jets after Poland and Slovakia pledges - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Poland pledged four MiG-29 jets on ThursdayBy Jonathan Beale, Defence correspondent, & Robert GreenallBBC NewsRussia has threatened to destroy any fighter jets given to Ukraine by its allies, after two countries promised planes.Slovakia became the second Nato country to pledge Kyiv some MiG-29 aircraft on Friday, a day after Poland.Slovakia´s fleet was grounded last year and it no longer uses the jets.Ukraine has asked Western countries for modern jets, but because of long training times, these are seen only as long-term options.It sees extra aircraft as important for its defences and possible counter-attacks, a year into Russia´s invasion.Other Nato countries are considering sending planes such as the MiG-29 - a model which dates from the time of the Soviet Union - which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the plans, saying that the aircraft would not affect the outcome of Moscow´s ""special military operation"", as it calls the war.He said they would only ""bring additional woes for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people"".""Of course, during the special military operation, all this equipment will be subject to destruction,"" the spokesman added.The Polish and Slovak pledges are a positive move for Ukraine - which has more pilots than planes - but will not make a decisive difference. The Ukrainians say what they really need is US-made F-16 fighters. Yuri Sak, a senior Ukrainian defence adviser, says the fourth-generation fighters have better capabilities.  It still seems unlikely that Ukraine would get them - at least for now, as it would take time to train Ukrainian pilots on Western jets.Western military officers remain sceptical about modern fighters. Their focus is on helping Ukraine win the battle on the ground. The front lines are swamped with air defence systems on both sides. The Russian air force is much bigger than Ukraine´s and it hasn´t been able to gain control of the skies.At the start of Russia´s full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have about 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing MiG-29s and Su-27s.On Friday, Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger tweeted that his government had approved sending the country´s 13 MiG-29s to Ukraine.He said ""promises must be kept"" and that he was glad others were answering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky´s call for more weapons.It is not clear how many of the Slovakian planes are operational.What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Mr Heger said Slovakia would also send Ukraine part of its Kub air defence system.On Thursday, Poland pledged four MiG-29s, to be sent in the coming days, but more are expected to follow.As with its pledge of Leopard tanks, Poland has broken a barrier. This was a step no-one was prepared to take a year ago.News of the pledges came amid Russian media reports that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had decorated pilots involved in an incident earlier this week .Washington has condemned the Russian actions, in which it says one of the Su-27 jets clipped the drone, as reckless, but Moscow says the drone failed on its own.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jetRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraineSlovakiaPoland",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64988504,17,03,2023,bbc,uk
What has happened to pay in the UK? - BBC News,"Image source, PA MediaBy Rob EnglandBBC Data Journalism TeamWages have failed to keep up with the rising cost of living for many UK workers, prompting a wave of strikes in recent months.Figures suggest the picture is much worse in some professions than others, with teachers and nurses seeing more pay lost to inflation than workers in other sectors.BBC News analysed salary figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the last 10 years to see how wages in different professions compare to the overall average, and to find out how far pay for train drivers, paramedics, civil servants and others, has kept up with prices.What is the average employee paid?Over the last decade, the wage of an average full-time employee in the UK has risen by about a quarter, to £33,000 in April 2022. That is almost in line with rising prices, falling just £230 short of matching inflation.You can see average pay in a range of sectors using this interactive chart.This is an average across each job category captured in the ONS survey, some of which include many different individual jobs. It may also include both those with and without London weighting in the average. The survey is made up of both public and private sector workers.

TeachersImage source, Getty ImagesThe average salary for secondary school teachers has fallen behind rising prices by nearly £4,500 over the last 10 years: one of the largest drops of the careers examined.The average secondary teacher earns more than the average overall worker: just under £41,000 last April. But had this salary kept pace with rising prices over this period, this figure would be more than £45,000.The ONS does not produce data for every type of teacher. But the picture for ""teaching professionals"" overall, which includes primary schools and university teaching staff, looks very similar to what has happened in secondary schools. They have an average wage of about £41,000 but this is nearly £5,000 behind the rise in prices since 2012.When are teachers striking, and what are they paid?Will some teachers receive a 15.9% pay rise?Junior doctorsImage source, ReutersImage caption, Junior doctors are asking for a 35% pay riseThe average earnings for a junior doctor in England in the year to March 2022 was just over £55,000, according to a separate analysis by the Nuffield Trust. The salaries of both junior and senior doctors are combined in the ONS´s data, and so the BBC is not able to analyse them in the same way as other careers.Senior doctors are not striking and are in the top 2% of earners in the UK.Junior doctors earn well above the average salary in England, but the Nuffield Trust estimate that their pay has fallen behind inflation by nearly £5,000 since 2011. This is a smaller fall than the headline figure used by the junior doctors´ union, the BMA, but still larger than many other groups of workers, based on the ONS data. Why are doctors demanding the biggest pay rise?How Monday´s junior doctors´ strike affects youWhen are the NHS strikes and what does it mean for patients?Civil servantsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, PCS union members on strike at Cardiff AirportThe wages of the most junior civil servants, or ""national government administrative occupations"" as the ONS calls them, have kept up with rising prices, but they are not well off.For this job category the average full-time salary is about £27,700 in the survey. That´s nearly £1,300 more than if the salary had just been increased by inflation over the past decade. But it is still well below the national average.This is also a very broad category which includes many different jobs within the civil service, both inside and outside London. For those in jobs on the lower end, starting salaries can be as lower, at about £21,000, but this isn´t shown in the average for the broader category.The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) say they´ve prioritised the wages of the least well off when negotiating with bosses in the civil service.On the next rung up are mid-level ""associate professionals"". Their average salary is about £2,400 above the national average, but if it had kept pace with prices since 2012, it would be nearly £900 pounds higher still.More civil servants to strike on Budget dayWho else is currently in negotiations?There are other workers represented in the data who have been poised to take, or have taken, strike action over the past few months, such as physiotherapists, ambulance staff, nurses and rail workers. Some are currently in pay negotiations with their employers.A new pay deal has been offered to NHS staff in England except doctors, which trade unions are recommending to members. Firefighters, who had threatened strike action, recently accepted a new pay deal.Broadly, the average salary of a nurse is a few thousand pounds higher than the national average, but their pay has not kept up with rising prices. For a full-time paramedic, the average salary is nearly 50% higher than the average worker´s salary and has grown by about £3,000 more than prices in the last 10 years. Unions say part of that growth is due to NHS pay scales in 2016, where paramedics were moved up a band to reflect changes in their jobs.Meanwhile, ambulance drivers and emergency medical technicians have been one of the hardest hit by inflation. They earned £27,500 as of 2022, which was nearly £1,600 less than if their pay had risen with inflation.While train drivers do well, that´s not true for all train workers. Rail travel assistants, a category which includes ticket inspectors and station attendants, saw a £300 drop in average pay versus inflation in the most recent figures. Does the average nurse earn £34,000 a year?When are the next train strikes? MethodologyThe salary data used in this analysis comes from the latest Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) from the ONS. We used gross pay for the average full time worker in each profession - using the median average - comparing growth in that pay to inflation as measured by annual CPIH.   Nuffield Trust´s figures were based on figures for NHS England and used a different measure of inflation called CPI that has grown slightly faster than CPIH. Where job names or codes changed from one year to the next, we used this lookup tool developed by Warwick University to match jobs. The coronavirus pandemic affected the survey figures for 2020 and 2021 due to various factors, including furlough. The ONS suggests treating these figures with greater caution.The salary is the pay of the average worker, rather than a precise measure of terms and conditions, pay bands or starting salaries. It includes overtime, bonuses or allowances for anti-social hours and covers workers in the public or private sector. Increases can be caused by things other than raises. These include a shift in seniority (lower-paid workers leaving the profession) or in working hours (more people doing overtime). The growth in average pay is likely to underestimate pay growth for an individual worker who may get promoted and move from being below-average to above-average within their profession.In the chart at the top of the story we refer to ""junior level"" and ""mid level"" civil servants. The ASHE descriptions for these jobs are national government administrative occupations (junior) and public services associate professionals (mid).Additional reporting by Becky Dale, Libby Rogers, Zoe Conway and Robert CuffeRelated TopicsTeachingUK ambulance servicesTrade UnionsDoctorsState schoolsTransportRail travelNursingNHSStrike actionCivil Service",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64944262,17,03,2023,bbc,uk
UK economy rebounds as Rishi Sunak says confidence is returning - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter, BBC NewsThe prime minister has said ""confidence is returning"" after official figures showed the economy grew by more than expected in January.Rishi Sunak said the data confirmed the government´s plan is ""the right one and we need to stick to it"".The economy expanded by 0.3% in January, rebounding from a sharp fall in December.Higher school attendance and the return of Premier League football after the World Cup helped boost the figure.The data comes ahead of the Budget next Wednesday when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will set out the government´s growth plans.January´s growth followed a 0.5% contraction in the economy during December. However, the ONS figures also showed that the economy stagnated in the November to January period compared with the previous three months.Mr Sunak added that the data showed the economy is ""better than people had feared"".But Rachel Reeves, Labour´s shadow chancellor, said: ""Today´s results show our economy is still inching along this Tory path of managed decline.""What is GDP and how does it affect me?Darren Morgan from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which collects and publishes the data, said the main factors behind January´s growth were ""the return of children to classrooms, following unusually high absences in the run-up to Christmas, the Premier League clubs returned to a full schedule after the end of the World Cup and private health providers also had a strong month"".""Postal services also partially recovered from the effects of December´s strikes."" In education, school absences rose in December due to a spike in winter flu, Covid-19 as well as rising rates of Strep A, which can lead to scarlet fever. The return of more children to school helps to boost the economy as it is deemed to increase the output of the education sector. The ONS said the education sector grew by 2.5% in January following a fall of 2.6% the month before. Activity in arts, entertainment and recreation also grew, mainly due to the return of Premier League football.These numbers are better than expected but the economy still has not grown over three months - and that is what is expected again between January and March.Consumers have proven more resilient so far to the rise in energy prices and interest rates.The Budget forecasts next week will be from a better baseline than feared last time, thanks to energy prices starting to fall.While avoiding a formal recession entirely is now possible, for now the overall trend in the economy is flat, with tax rises and the full effect of higher interest rates to come.However, the figures for January showed a fall in output in both the manufacturing and construction sectors. ""Looking beneath the surface, the figures suggest the economy is on weaker ground than it appears,"" said Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics. She added that strike action in February may have hit growth and the impact of successive interest rate rises is yet to be felt by parts of the economy. Last month, ambulance workers, teachers, nurses and some in the rail industry walked out.""So we doubt January´s strength will last and our hunch is that there will still be a recession,"" said Ms Gregory.However, other economists were more upbeat including Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, which predicted that the UK will avoid a downturn.A recession is usually defined as two three-month periods in a row when the economy shrinks.What is a recession and how could it affect me?The UK reported flat growth between October and December and Goldman now expects flat growth to continue in the first three months of this year. The UK continues to grapple with a high rate of price rises, or inflation, leading to a squeeze on the cost of living. While it has fallen back slightly in recent months as wholesale gas prices have ticked lower, inflation remains at its highest level for nearly four decades.The Bank of England has raised interest rates to 4% - the highest since 2008 - in an attempt to quell inflation. While that benefits some savers, it has also raised pressures on many mortgage holders.Related TopicsGDPEconomic growthUK economy",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64904333,10,03,2023,bbc,uk
Ukraine war: Russian reservists fighting with shovels - UK defence ministry - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The MPL-50 is particularly mythologised in Russia, the UK defence ministry said (stock photo)Russian reservists could be using ""shovels"" for ""hand-to-hand"" combat in Ukraine due to a shortage of ammunition, the UK´s Ministry of Defence says.In late February, reservists described being ordered to assault a Ukrainian position ""armed with only ´firearms and shovels´"", the ministry said in its latest intelligence update.It mentioned a shovel known as MPL-50.The tool was designed in 1869 and had changed little, the ministry said.It has been part of the Russian reservist army kit for decades.""The lethality of the standard-issue MPL-50 entrenching tool is particularly mythologised in Russia,"" the ministry said.The continued use of the shovel ""as a weapon highlights the brutal and low-tech fighting which has come to characterise much of the war"", it said.One of the reservists described being ""neither physically nor psychologically"" prepared for the action, the update added.""Recent evidence suggests an increase in close combat in Ukraine,"" it said. ""This is probably a result of the Russian command continuing to insist on offensive action largely consisting of dismounted infantry, with less support from artillery fire because Russia is short of munitions.""The BBC has been unable to independently verify these reports. The ministry did not give information on where such battles were taking place.Analysts say that although there is indeed an ammunition shortage, the situation is more complex than the intelligence update suggests, with Russian forces still using twice as much ammunition as the Ukrainian side.Is Russia’s stock of weapons running low?Meanwhile Russian forces appear to have secured a sufficient positional advantage in the besieged city of Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said.Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take control of the small city, where around 4,000 civilians remain. Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia, but the city´s strategic value has been questioned.The ISW said Russia´s positional advantage could allow a ""turning movement"" in the city. The purpose of a turning movement is to force the enemy to abandon prepared defensive positions, and is different from the aim of an encirclement, which is to trap and destroy enemy forces, the ISW says. ""The Russians may have intended to encircle Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, but the Ukrainian command has signalled that it will likely withdraw rather than risk an encirclement,"" the ISW said.However, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday that it had no intention of withdrawing from Bakhmut.A statement by the Armed Forces General Staff acknowledged that Russian forces were still trying to surround the city, but said more than 100 attacks had been repelled in the eastern Donbas region in the past 24 hours. Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64855760,06,03,2023,bbc,uk
Nobel scientist says 'UK research is in jeopardy' - BBC News,"Image source, TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARYImage caption, The report warns of ´´serious underspending´´ on UK researchBy Pallab GhoshScience correspondentA new assessment of Britain´s research capability has concluded that it has ""serious and longstanding problems"".The report´s author, Nobel Prize winner Sir Paul Nurse, said that the government ""seriously underspends"" on research.He also added that association with the EU´s Horizon programme was ""critical"".Sir Paul said the Prime Minister might not have received the best advice, following a BBC News report that he was considering alternative proposals.Sir Paul´s assessment is contained in a report commissioned by the department for business last year. In summarising its conclusions, Sir Paul said that UK research was ""fragile, in jeopardy, and needs fixing"".A spokesperson for the newly created Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) welcomed the report which was described as ""thorough and thoughtful"".""It will help us further understand the challenges and opportunities faced by UK researchers, and we will consider it carefully before responding in full,"" they added.Scientists warn Sunak on EU research programmeTreasury takes back £1.6bn promised for scienceSir Paul´s conclusions will come as a surprise, following as they do, a commitment by government to substantially increase research funding and the recent establishment of a new department specifically dedicated to research. But a new funding assessment by Sir Paul and DSIT officials has found that direct government spending on research, as a proportion of the UK´s Gross Domestic Product, is just 0.46%. This compares with an average for other OECD, or higher-income, countries of 0.6%. It puts the UK 27th in a list of 38 such nations.And the 0.46% number is substantially lower than South Korea, Germany and the United States, which spend 0.66-0.96% of GDP on research and development (R&D). (GDP is a measure of the size and health of a country´s economy over a period of time).Sir Paul also denounces successive ministers for short-term thinking by announcing ""shiny new institutes"", rather than having a stable, long-term plan for science. It is a view supported by James Wilsdon, a professor of research policy at University College London.""The problem is that we have a government which has now shown over 13 years, 5 prime ministers and 10 or 11 science ministers that it has far more interest in tweaking and tinkering with the fine detail of the R&D system than in providing the long-term stability of vision and investment that the system urgently needs.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Prof Sir Paul Nurse warns that PM may not have received the best advice on the Horizon Europe programmeSir Paul reserved some of his strongest remarks about reports that the Prime Minister was considering not taking up the arrangement offered by the European Union of full association to the bloc´s £85bn (€95.5bn) Horizon research programme.BBC News reported last week that Mr Sunak was considering an attempt to renegotiate a cut-down association, with the money saved spent on a UK-led alternative international scientific collaborations.""The UK will find it extremely difficult to be an effective research power if it stands alone and is not part of a European network.´´The alternative arrangements being discussed will be utterly inadequate,"" Sir Paul said at a news conference.""The Prime Minister may not have received the best advice. He is a sensible person, and I don´t think he will want the risk of alienating the entire scientific community.""Sir Paul added that lack of access to Horizon was putting off some of the brightest overseas scientists from applying to work in the UK, with many telling his review that Britain was no longer perceived as a welcoming place to work; some, he said, had left the country to find jobs elsewhere.Prof Sir Adrian Smith, President of the Royal Society which represents the UK´s leading scientists, welcomed Sir Paul´s calls for increased investment in science.""The newly established Department for Science, Innovation and Technology needs to rapidly drive the changes needed across the whole of government, if they are to deliver on the Prime Minister´s ambition for the UK.""Prof Sarah Main, Executive Director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) said: ""This review is a blueprint for how the UK can make the most of its science capabilities to improve lives and livelihoods, through integrating national assets, infrastructure, skills, and investment. Long-termism is the magic ingredient, and we call on all political parties to work together to secure a UK strategy for R&D.""

Like him, she´s been in the music business for a while, releasing her debut single Close in 2018; and scoring a minor hit in 2021 with Better Days.Hailed as ""the relatable queen of sass"" and a ""pop sensation in the making"", she´s already been nominated for an MTV Award, and worked with stars including Little Mix and Marshmello.Here´s everything you need to know about the 2023 Eurovision hopeful.Mae Muller announced as UK act for Eurovision 2023Eurovision 2023 tickets sell out after huge demandWhen is Eurovision and where will it be held?

""Every Christmas or family thing, I was like, ´I want to put on a show! Everyone sit down, I wanna sing for you!´""It sounds so silly but I just loved music and I felt I loved music more than anybody else.""Her parents separated when she was six, but Mae stayed in London with her mum, a costume designer, while attending school in Tufnell, where she taught younger children creative writing.Handily, her aunt is a music video director, and Muller used to spend afternoons as a runner for artists like Labrinth, for whom she once made tea in a polystyrene cup. ""It was my claim to fame for a long time,"" she told Golden Plectrum.She´s never confirmed her aunt´s identity - but it seems likely to be Sophie Muller, the acclaimed director of videos like No Doubt´s Don´t Speak, Bjork´s Venus As A Boy and Beyoncé´s Deja Vu.Sophie also directed the clip for Mika´s Grace Kelly, which brings us to this... Her first role was in a Mika videoFigure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsWhen she was nine years old, Muller starred in the video for Mika´s breakout single, dancing around in a lime green ballgown, and lip-syncing Grace Kelly´s dialogue from The Country Girl.""I actually got it based on how [messed] up my teeth were, apparently,´ she said on a recent episode of Never Mind The Buzzcocks.""I guess they saw all the auditions and he went, ´She´s got some real intense teeth. That´s good, we like that´.""Gwen Stefani made her pursue musicImage caption, Gwen Stefani´s biggest solo hits included The Sweet Escape and Hollaback GirlThe first album she obsessed over was Gwen Stefani´s Love Angel Music Baby - a hyperactive pop classic that married pop, hip-hop and a retrospectively questionable obsession with Japanese Harajuku culture.""I wouldn´t say she influenced my music and songwriting, but after discovering Gwen I knew that I wanted to do what she did,"" Muller told Wonderland magazine in 2018.Other early influences included Florence + The Machine (""I would listen to her on my headphones and cry about some 12-year-old boy I was upset about"") and Lily Allen´s debut album, Alright Still.""We used to listen to it on holiday,"" she recalled. ""We´d be driving around these beautiful mountains and Lily Allen would come on saying the rudest things. I was still at primary school so I didn´t really know what it meant, but I knew I was obsessed with it.""She wrote her first song because the Wi-fi failedImage source, Maximilian HetheringtonImage caption, The singer has collaborated with Marshmello, Ms Banks and SigalaDespite her aspirations, Muller only wrote her first song when she was 19 - and even then, she was forced into it.The singer was taking a train from her father´s house in Cornwall back to London when the Wi-fi cut out, and she started writing a tune about her boyfriend to stave off the boredom.""I opened Notes [on my phone] and started singing melodies and anything that came into my head,"" she told The Line Of Best Fit. ""I just said how I felt and tried to make it into a song and it worked.""After getting home, she asked a friend to help her record the song on his laptop, and uploaded the track - now called Closer - to the internet.""I gave him a bottle of wine for doing it, because I had no money.""The song is still on her Soundcloud now.""From there it just kind of snowballed,"" she told Glamour magazine. ""I started getting into sessions and just making more and more music and working on improving my writing skills."" Those early songs scored her a manager and a publishing deal, and she was signed to Capitol Records in 2018.Better Days was her breakout hitFigure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsA collaboration with Swedish producers Neiked, Better Days blew up in September 2021, giving Muller her first taste of chart success.An upbeat, joyous slice of dance-pop, it´s an obvious festival-slayer, but Muller was initially reluctant to record it.""I used to be very stubborn with recording songs that I didn´t write myself, because that´s always what I´ve done,"" she told Women In Pop.""But I listened to it  and I just fell in love with it. A great song is a great song, and Neiked said ´Put your sauce on it´ and so I did and it just felt right.""She was right to trust her instincts - the song sold more than a million copies and has gone platinum in the US.Her Eurovision song is a diss trackSkip twitter post by Mae Muller 💃🏻THIS ONES FOR THE GIRLIESSSS ❤️ https://t.co/YD3WVT3OAt pic.twitter.com/Mi0Hlv9GqV— Mae Muller 💃🏻 (@maemuller_) February 28, 2023

""And I recently got a Harry Styles mug, and now I have to have it in my Harry Styles mug. ""I need him by my side!""Her love for Styles runs deep. ""When I was 13, I went to see One Direction on X Factor, and I´ve grown up with him, she told Capital Radio last year.But the obsession almost got her into trouble last year - after she released a cover of Styles´ As It Was, and used the Harry Styles mug as the artwork.""I failed to realise you can´t just have the most famous man in the world´s face on your release without their permission,"" she admitted.

UK firms await government help after US bank collapse - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC NewsUK tech firms are anxiously waiting to find out what government support they will get after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the US. Some have told the BBC they could go bust if help does not come soon enough.The Treasury says it is working to find a solution. An investment group has also offered to buy the bank´s UK arm.It comes as US customers have already been told their deposits will be fully protected by the US government, putting pressure on the UK government to act.Speaking to reporters in San Diego on Sunday evening, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: ""We will have something to say very shortly.""But we will continue to support our world-beating technology sector and all the high-skilled jobs that it supports and also you should be reassured that our overall financial system is sound and there´s nothing to worry about there.""Earlier, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the BBC there was no risk to the UK´s financial system from the collapse of SVB, but ""there is a serious risk to some of our most promising companies in technology and life sciences"". He said he had been working with the prime minister and Bank of England governor ""through the weekend to come up with a solution"", and the government would bring forward a plan in the ""next few days"". Labour has criticised the government for not acting sooner. Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators on Friday in what was the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.Faisal Islam: Is the UK right to bail out tech firms?The bank´s UK subsidiary was put into insolvency on Sunday. It will allow individual depositors to be paid up to £85,000 from the UK´s deposit insurance scheme. However, most have far more money than this saved with the bank and will struggle to keep going if they are not able to access it. Image caption, Toby Mather, founder of Lingumi, says his firm is highly exposedToby Mather, chief executive and co-founder of Lingumi, an education technology start-up, told the BBC his business was highly exposed to SVB´s collapse. He said: ""85% of our cash is held in Silicon Valley Bank.. [So this] is a really existential threat to us because I´ve got to pay my employees and they´ve got kids and mortgages and so on."" He also warned the ripple effect could be ""huge"" if deposits are not secured. Camilla Easter, chief executive at Oxford Medical Products, a health-tech company, said she was working ""incredibly hard to see how we can meet our obligations to our shareholders and creditors"".""What we need as an industry right now is for them to very rapidly give us a short-term plan on how we can access our money in those accounts,"" she told the BBC. ´Preventative action´US based Etsy, the online crafts marketplace, said had experienced a delay in issuing payments to some sellers related to the unexpected collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. It said teams were ""working around the clock to implement a solution"" and that it expected to pay sellers via its other payment partners in the coming daysMore than 200 bosses of UK tech companies signed a letter addressed to Mr Hunt on Saturday calling for the government to step in.The letter, from Fintech Founders, said many financial technology firms did all of their banking with SVB ""and will therefore go into receivership imminently unless preventative action is taken"".One source in a tech firm told the BBC between 30% and 40% of UK start-ups employing up to 50,000 people could be affected by the collapse.On Sunday, a consortium of investors led by The Bank of London, a clearing bank, submitted a formal bid to buy SVB UK. Others including a Middle Eastern investment fund and the banks Barclays and Oaknorth are also said to be mulling offers.SVB collapsed in the US after failing to raise $2.25bn (£1.9bn) to plug a loss from the sale of assets, mainly US government bonds, that were affected by higher interest rates. Its troubles prompted a run on the bank in the US and sparked investor fears about the general state of the banking sector.On Sunday, the US government said people and businesses who had money deposited in Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) would be able to access all their cash from Monday.It also said the taxpayer would not bear any costs from the move. What went wrong at Silicon Valley Bank?Silicon Valley Bank specialised in lending to early-stage businesses, and the company served nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. It employs more than 8,500 people globally, with most of its operations in the US. But it has been under pressure as higher rates make it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales. More clients were withdrawing deposits in a trend that snowballed last week.Silicon Valley Bank UK, which has stopped making payments or accepting deposits, is officially expected to go into insolvency on Sunday evening.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64934351,13,03,2023,bbc,uk

Millions returned to museums and galleries in 2022 as Covid restrictions ended, the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) said.But fewer international tourists meant visitor levels were still almost a quarter lower than before the pandemic.The Crown Estate, Windsor Great Park, remained the most popular attraction.Indoor sites saw a 176% increase in the number of people visiting compared to the previous year, ALVA said.For much of 2021 facemasks and social distancing had been required at inside venues to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Big London attractions with no entry fee like the Natural History Museum, British Museum and Tate Modern saw their numbers recover by around 200%.Overall visits to British attractions increased 69% compared to 2021, but they saw 37.8 million fewer people walk through their doors than in 2019.ALVA, which represents more than 2,200 sites, puts the 23% shortfall down to lower levels of tourism, especially from China and east Asia.Image caption, The Crown Estate, Windsor Great Park, was the most visited UK attraction in 2022 - the year of Queen Elizabeth´s Platinum Jubilee and deathImage caption, The top 10 list was dominated by London attractions, including the National Gallery in Trafalgar SquareImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Tower of London was the most visited major attraction with an entry fee in 2022Despite a very busy Christmas period, Bernard Donoghue, director of ALVA, warned the industry was ""still experiencing the tourism equivalent of ´long Covid´"" because of fewer holidaymakers coming to the UK.He later apologised for making the ´inappropriate´ comparison after receiving complaints from long Covid advocacy campaigners.Although there are ongoing challenges, he said he was ""confident that [tourists] will return this year and we will see a continuing healthy recovery"".The figures also reveal people are opting for attractions which are free amid the cost-of-living crisis: places which charged an entry fee saw a recovery of 101% - but free sites had a 183% increase.Mr Donoghue also said rail strikes had impacted people visiting theatres - particularly over Christmas.He added he was confident the Chinese market would come back in 2023, driving ""really strong growth"".London dominated the top ten list but popular spots around the UK saw growth.In Scotland, the most popular attraction was the National Museum in Edinburgh.

"Aukus deal: US, UK and Australia agree on nuclear submarine project - BBC News","Related TopicsAukusThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Joe Biden: ""Nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed subs""By Kathryn Armstrong, Frances Mao & Tom Housdenin London, Singapore and SydneyThe US, UK and Australia have unveiled details of their plan to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, aimed at countering China´s influence in the Indo-Pacific region.Under the Aukus pact Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs - at least three - from the US.The allies will also work to create a new fleet using cutting-edge tech, including UK-made Rolls-Royce reactors.Beijing has strongly criticised the significant naval deal.Its foreign ministry on Tuesday accused the three nations of ""walking further and further down the path of error and danger"".China´s UN mission had earlier also accused the Western allies of setting back nuclear non-proliferation efforts.But US President Joe Biden said the deal was aimed at bolstering peace in the region and stressed the submarines would be ""nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed"". Aukus summit projection of power and collaborative intentSpeaking alongside the UK and Australian prime ministers - Rishi Sunak and Anthony Albanese - in San Diego, California, Mr Biden said the deal would not jeopardise Australia´s commitment to being a nuclear-free country. For Australia, it is a major upgrade to the US ally´s military capabilities. The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington´s elite nuclear propulsion technology. The submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country´s existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia will also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time. Under the deal, Australian navy sailors will be sent to US and UK submarine bases from this year to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.From 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia, before Canberra will buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more. After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies - a model that is being called SSN-AUKUS. This attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The US, Australia and UK will jointly build a new class of submarinesPresident Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring the Indo-Pacific region would remain free and open. ""Forging this new partnership, we´re showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,"" he said.He also pledged of $4.6bn (£3.7bn) to expanding the US´ submarine construction capacity and improving maintenance of its current nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines.Australia´s PM said the plan - which will cost Canberra up to A$368bn (£201bn) over 30 years - marked the ""biggest single investment in Australia´s defence capability in all of its history"".Anthony Albanese said building the submarines in Australian shipyards would also create thousands of local jobs. The UK PM also said thousands of jobs would be created in Derby and Barrow-in-Furness, where some of the construction would take place.Mr Sunak said that in the 18 months since the Aukus alliance was unveiled, the challenges to global stability had only grown. ""Russia´s illegal invasion of Ukraine, China´s growing assertiveness, the destabilising behaviour of Iran and North Korea - all threaten to create a world codefined by danger, disorder and division,"" Mr Sunak said.As part of his visit to the US, Mr Sunak has also pledged to increase defence spending by nearly £5bn ($6bn) over the next two years to counter threats from hostile states.The Aukus security alliance - announced in September 2021 - has repeatedly drawn criticism from China. Beijing´s foreign ministry last week reiterated its position that the pact risked creating an arms race.But the three Western countries say the security deal is aimed at shoring up stability in the Indo-Pacific. While all three leaders have stressed how the deal will strengthen their co-operation, it hasn´t been without its political fallout.In 2021, Australia scrapped a multi-million dollar diesel-powered submarine agreement with France in favour of the trilateral agreement - causing a political rift with Paris. Australia also faces a delicate diplomatic situation with China - its largest trading partner.

Brexit: Could Windsor Framework reset strained UK-Ireland ties? - BBC News,"Related TopicsBrexitImage source, Getty ImagesBy Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin CorrespondentThe Republic of Ireland - more than any other EU state - wants to get Brexit done at last.It shares a land border with Northern Ireland and the UK.It is keenly aware of the sensitivities of those unionists north of that border who see the Northern Ireland Protocol as a threat to their Britishness.In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, the protocol effectively created a trade border for goods travelling across the Irish Sea from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The strength of unionist feeling against that was such that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to participate in the political institutions set up by the 25-year-old Good Friday Agreement that helped bed down the peace process after three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.Attention in Dublin will now turn to whether the DUP - the biggest unionist party at Stormont - sees enough in the Windsor Framework to return to the power-sharing government in Belfast.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson´s opinion on the Windsor Framework will be keenly anticipated in DublinFew expect the DUP to sign up immediately to the new agreement, at least in part because it has to contest council elections in Northern Ireland in May.But the hope is there will be no immediate, outright rejection.""The perfect is the enemy of the good"" and ""in any negotiation nobody gets everything they want"" are two phrases we can expect to hear a lot of in the coming days.Twice before the EU has seen the UK government attempt to renege on a Brexit deal it had agreed to, largely because of internal Conservative Party divisions.But there is confidence in Dublin that this time it will be third time lucky, not least because the price of failure - including a possible trade war over broken promises - is too high to pay amid a cost-of-living crisis.There is no doubt that Brexit soured the good relations that had existed between the UK and Ireland because of their joint interest in Northern Ireland affairs in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement.The hope now is that the Windsor Framework will allow a reset, not just between the two states but also between the UK and the wider EU.But it is only hope - not yet confidence or certainty.Related TopicsNI BrexitRepublic of IrelandEuropean UnionBrexit",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64791697,28,02,2023,bbc,uk
"Northern Ireland Protocol: UK on 'cusp' of new Brexit deal, says Dominic Raab - BBC News","Related TopicsBrexitThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: We´ve made progress on Northern Ireland Brexit deal - RaabBy Andre Rhoden-PaulBBC NewsThe UK ""is on the cusp"" of securing a new Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, the deputy prime minister has said. Dominic Raab told the BBC the government had made ""great progress"" negotiating with the European Union. The UK wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol, an agreement with the EU which sees certain goods checked when entering from the rest of the UK.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was giving the negotiations ""everything"" in an attempt to clinch a deal. Speaking on BBC Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Raab said: ""We´re on the cusp, we´ve made great progress, we´re not there yet, but it would be a really important deal...""I think it would mark a paradigm shift first and foremost for the communities in Northern Ireland, but I think it would be a significant achievement.""It´s about leadership now for Sunak  - Kuenssberg DUP´s moment of truth fast approachingThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has complained about what it calls a ""democratic deficit"" with Northern Ireland being subject to EU rules while not having a say on them. Mr Raab said the EU had ""moved"" on some issues, saying: ""If there are any new rules that would apply in relation to Northern Ireland, it must be right that there is a Northern Irish democratic check on that.""The protocol, signed by Boris Johnson in 2020, sees Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU laws so that goods can flow freely over the border to the Irish Republic without checks.  The DUP believes the protocol undermines the nation´s position within the rest of the UK as well as having an adverse impact on trade flow. The party has prevented a Northern Ireland devolved government from forming - leaving it in political gridlock.Mr Raab said the UK wants to see a move away from checks on every consignment of goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The EU is worried about goods posing a threat to the single market by moving between Northern Ireland and the EU.He suggested an ""intelligence-based"" rather than ""tick box"" approach for goods - ""which effectively means, they look at what is happening in the Republic with goods that go to Northern Ireland in case there´s a risk of them going into the wider single market - and if we can achieve that, it will be a massive win.""What is the Northern Ireland Protocol?The Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks.Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries. The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland´s troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability.The UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday agreement - was an absolute priority.So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.It is now part of international law. Learn more about it here.Rishi Sunak said on Saturday his government was ""giving it everything we´ve got"" to finalise a deal to fix issues with the protocol.But he has been warned by Eurosceptic Conservative MPs not to rush into calling a vote in Parliament on the new agreement. Asked if MPs would get to vote on any new deal, Mr Raab said: ""Parliament will have its ability to express itself.""Mark Francois, who heads the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, warned Mr Sunak it would be ""incredibly unwise"" to bring in any new deal without giving MPs a vote.He told Sky News: ""Don´t try to bounce Parliament next week because that is likely to go badly wrong.""So, if they´ve got a deal they´re proud of, show us the text. Let us run it by our lawyers. Let us fully understand what it means. Then, at that point, we might be ready to vote on it.""He added that EU law needed to be ""expunged"" from Northern Ireland, bringing it in line with England, Scotland and Wales.But former Prime Minister John Major urged Conservative and DUP MPs to not let concerns over the European Court of Justice get in the way of easing trade and restoring the devolved government in Northern Ireland.He told BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour: ""Their involvement would be tiny... occasional involvement of the ECJ really ought not to stop an agreement being made.""They talk of democracy. Democracy is thrown away when that [Northern Ireland] Assembly is not sitting. We need them back.""Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour´s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said his party would vote for a new deal in the national interest of the UK and restoring Northern Ireland´s Assembly.""Our judgement is that any deal that emerges will be better than what we´ve got now,"" he said.On Saturday, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar also said the deal was ""inching towards a conclusion"", and urged the EU and the UK to ""go the extra mile"" to close the deal.Related TopicsNI BrexitBrexit",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64777351,26,02,2023,bbc,uk
Extended life for two UK nuclear power stations - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, EDF operates Hartlepool nuclear power station in TeessideBy Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC NewsEnergy giant EDF has announced plans to extend the lives of two of the UK´s five remaining nuclear power stations.Heysham 1 and Hartlepool had been due to close in March next year, but they will now be kept open until early 2026.The company says the move will support energy security, reduce demand for imported gas, and reduce carbon emissions.About 1,400 people work at the two sites, with hundreds more in the supply chain.The government welcomed the news, with Secretary of State Grant Shapps saying Russia´s invasion of Ukraine demonstrated the ""vital importance"" of bolstering energy security. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool began operating in 1983. Each has two Advanced Gas Cooled reactors, which were originally scheduled for closure in 2014. Two previous lifetime extensions had taken the closure date to March 2024. The two power stations currently account for about 5% of the country´s electricity.The announcement comes at a time when the country´s energy security has been coming under intense scrutiny.The bulk of our electricity is generated from gas. Last year, the conflict in Ukraine led to a sudden spike in gas prices - which also led to a steep increase in electricity bills.Renewable generation, from wind and solar power for example, has been growing rapidly in recent years. But the amount available to the grid can vary according to the time of day and the weather.Supporters of nuclear generation argue that it provides baseload power - in other words, a predictable and stable supply - although other sources are needed to react quickly to spikes in demand.Image source, Robin Drayton/GeographImage caption, Heysham 1, left, near MorecambeTo prevent potential blackouts this winter, five ageing coal plants have been kept on standby by National Grid. Earlier this week two of them were ordered to start generating power, as a combination of high demand and limited supplies led to concerns about possible shortages.A new scheme under which consumers are paid to reduce consumption at peak times has also been tried out recently.EDF said the decision to keep Heysham 1 and Hartlepool open had been taken following a ""rigorous review"" of the technical and commercial cases for keeping them open.It pointed to inspections of the reactor cores last year which ""increased confidence that the stations can generate for longer and continue to meet stringent regulatory standards"".The company has, however, closed three other nuclear power stations over the past 18 months. Under current plans, even with the extensions agreed today, the country´s entire fleet of AGR reactors is due to close by 2028.Sizewell B, a reactor built to a different design, is expected to remain open until 2035.The government is committed to building a new generation of nuclear power stations. But only one - Hinkley Point C - is currently under construction. The new £25bn plant, which has been beset by rising costs and delays, is not expected to open before June 2027.An expert group that includes some vocal opponents of nuclear power, the International Nuclear Risk Assessment Group, said in 2021 - in a report looking at ageing nuclear power plants - that extensions inevitably increase the risk of accidents, including the release of radioactive substances in to the environment.Heysham 1 and Hartlepool began generating power in the 1980s.Related TopicsHeyshamEnergy storageEnergy industryNuclear powerHartlepoolEDF Energy",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64906179,09,03,2023,bbc,uk

Eurasian elk: UK breeding programme begins at wildlife park - BBC News,"Image source, Wildwood TrustImage caption, Eurasian elk Caramel and Jurgeon have been brought together at WildwoodBy Stuart MaisnerBBC NewsTwo Eurasian elk have been brought together for the UK´s only breeding programme of the species. The programme by Wildwood Trust, based near Canterbury, Kent, follows its high-profile project last year to release bison into the wild to boost biodiversity and habitat restoration. Eurasian elk are the largest members of the deer family and are currently extinct in the wild in the UK.A spokesman for Wildwood described the breeding pair as ""ecosystem engineers"".Caramel, who has been at the wildlife park since 2013, is now sharing an enclosure with new resident bull Jurgeon. Mark Habben, Wildwood´s director of zoological operations said: ""This is an incredibly exciting first step and a natural progression from the work we´ve been doing with the bison in Blean Woods to help combat climate change.""In the same way that the bison are helping to restore ancient woodland, we believe that elk could have an equally beneficial impact on wetland environments. ""The calves that this pair will hopefully breed could in turn go on to directly benefit future habitat restoration projects.""Image source, Wildwood TrustImage caption, Eurasian elk are extinct in the wild in the UKElk went extinct in the UK about 2,000-3,000 years ago. Keeper Jon Forde said: ""The introduction has gone well, as we hoped it would. Caramel, who´s been with us since 2013, was slightly wary at first but is adjusting well. ""We were hopeful that the pair would get on as we´d started to notice when we came to see them in the mornings that they´d moved closer to each other overnight and they have a lovely way of chatting.""Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

Introduced in 2022, the saving on fuel had been due to end in April.The measure applies to the island under its Customs and Excise Agreement with the UK.Under the reciprocal measures, taxes on alcohol, which had been frozen since the UK´s 2020 Autumn budget, will rise in line with UK inflation and tobacco will see a 2% increase above inflation from August.Those measures are separate from the 2023-24 Isle of Man budget, which Dr Allinson outlined to Tynwald in February.That allocated a total of £1.2bn of government spending which has a focus on healthcare and education, which were given uplifts of £20.5m and £11.5m respectively.Dr Allinson is due to deliver an update to politicians on the island´s fiscal position in July.Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

TikTok: UK ministers banned from using Chinese-owned app on government phones - BBC News,"Image source, PA MediaBy Chas Geiger & Zoe KleinmanBBC NewsBritish government ministers have been banned from using Chinese-owned social media app TikTok on their work phones and devices on security grounds.The government fears sensitive data held on official phones could be accessed by the Chinese government. Cabinet Minister Oliver Dowden said the ban was a ""precautionary"" move but would come into effect immediately.TikTok has strongly denied allegations that it hands users´ data to the Chinese government.Theo Bertram, the app´s vice-president of government relations and public policy in Europe, told the BBC it believed the decision was based on ""more on geopolitics than anything else"".""We asked to be judged not on the fears that people have, but on the facts,"" he added.The Chinese embassy in London said the move was motivated by politics ""rather than facts"" and would ""undermine the confidence of the international community in the UK´s business environment"". Mr Dowden said he would not advise the public against using TikTok, but they should always ""consider each social media platform´s data policies before downloading and using them"".Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had been under pressure from senior MPs to follow the US and the European Union in barring the video-sharing app from official government devices.But government departments - and individual ministers - have embraced TikTok as a way of getting their message out to younger people.Use of the app has exploded in recent years, with 3.5 billion downloads worldwide.Its success comes from how easy it is to record short videos with music and fun filters, but also from its algorithm which is good at serving up videos which appeal to individual users.It is able to do this because it gathers a lot of information on users - including their age, location, device and even their typing rhythms - while its cookies track their activity elsewhere on the internet. US-based social media sites also do this but TikTok´s Chinese parent company ByteDance has faced claims of being influenced by Beijing.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Ros Atkins on... The creeping TikTok bansDowning Street - which last posted a TikTok video of Larry the Cat predicting football results - said it would continue to use TikTok to get the government´s message out. It said there were exemptions to the ban under some circumstances.Some politicians are also reluctant to give up the TikTok habit, despite the security warnings.Cabinet minister Grant Shapps - an enthusiastic TikTokker - reacted to the ban by posting a clip from the film, Wolf Of Wall Street, in which Leonardo DiCaprio, playing a New York stockbroker, uses a series of expletives and declares: ""The show goes on"".  Mr Shapps called the ban ""sensible"", but added: ""I´ve never used TikTok on government devices and can hereby confirm I will NOT be leaving TikTok anytime soon!""Ministers have not been banned from using the site on their personal phones - just their work devices.But Nadine Dorries - who experimented with TikTok videos when she was culture secretary - said she would be deleting the app from her personal phone, adding: ""I think all MPs should do likewise.""This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Oliver Dowden and Angela Rayner on banning the use of TikTok on government devices over cyber-security fears.Hours before the ban was announced the Ministry of Defence (MoD) uploaded a video of a Challenger 2 tank, a type being supplied to Ukraine, to its TikTok account.The MoD said it would continue to use the app ""to promote the work of the Armed Forces and to communicate our support to Ukraine"". The department´s sensitive data is ""held on a separate system"", it added.TikTok says US threatens ban if China stake not soldMinister asks cyber experts to investigate TikTokTikTok users shrug at China fears: ´It´s hard to care´The Welsh government has also banned TikTok from the work phones of ministers and civil servants. In Edinburgh, a spokesperson for the Scottish government said officials were liaising with the Cabinet Office ""as we consider the need for further action"". But MSPs and staff working at the Scottish Parliament have been ""strongly advised"" by Holyrood officials to remove the app from their devices. Holyrood officials said the advice was precautionary but necessary on security grounds. In a statement on Thursday, TikTok said the UK government´s decision was based on ""fundamental misconceptions"". ""We remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns but should be judged on facts and treated equally to our competitors,"" a spokesman added.Image source, MoD/TikTokImage caption, The Ministry of Defence says it will continue to post on TikTokA handful of Western journalists were found to have been tracked by ByteDance employees. ByteDance says they were fired. A US TikTokker shared a video criticising the Chinese government´s treatment of the Uighur Muslims, and it was taken down. TikTok said this was a mistake.This has added to the nervousness of governments and security specialists - despite the firm´s consistent denials. The Chinese state demands loyalty from all businesses based in the country and nobody really knows to what extent ByteDance might be pushed to comply with demands for data.Image source, TiktokImage caption, Larry the Downing Street cat starred in the most recent No 10 TikTok video in the summer of 2021The United States barred TikTok from official devices in December, and the European Commission followed suit last month.

"Hundreds of UK sex offenders went missing, figures show - BBC News","Image caption, Campaigners want a ´Della´s Law´ to ban sex offenders changing names, named after survivor Della WrightBy Alex HomerBBC Shared Data UnitHundreds of sex offenders across the UK slipped off the radar of police in a three-year period, the BBC can reveal.Freedom of Information requests by BBC News to 45 police forces reveal 729 sex offenders had gone missing or were wanted for arrest from 2019-2021.Abuse survivors have called on the government to introduce a new law to ban sex offenders changing their names.The Home Office says it has ""some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders"".Calling the situation a scandal, MP Sarah Champion said the key reason so many offenders went missing was because they had changed their names.Perpetrators should not be able to change their names and escape the authorities and their pasts, according to campaigners. MPs were due to discuss the issue on Thursday.The BBC Shared Data Unit also found that almost 1,500 registered sex offenders notified police forces of lawful name changes. Twenty-one police forces provided those figures. The campaign group, the Safeguarding Alliance, has raised the scale of this issue since 2019.There are around 67,000 registered sex offenders living in the UK.Name changes ´scandal´Image caption, Sarah Champion MP said this issue had been ""dumped in the ´too difficult´ drawer.""Critics say the law is too easy to bypass because it places the onus on offenders to report changes in their circumstances. Ms Champion is the Labour MP for Rotherham, where at least 1,400 children were the victims of abuse between 1997 and 2013.She previously raised in Parliament registered sex offenders were changing their names then applying for fresh identity documents, allowing them to potentially secure jobs working with children.‘Mum killed our abuser - it didn’t stop the nightmares’Watch on iPlayer - Killing My Children´s AbuserThe costs ranged from £42.44 for an enrolled deed poll, where the applicant´s new name was added to public records. Some offenders were changing their names while in prison by paying an administration fee of £15 for a ""do-it-yourself"" unenrolled deed poll which required two witnesses, she previously told Parliament. Ms Champion said: ""Clearly, the current system of notification isn´t working. The sheer scale of breaches and sex offenders going missing is a scandal, but one the public don´t know about.""What is the current law?If someone is added to the Sex Offenders Register, they are required to provide certain personal details to the police, including their name, any aliases they have been known by, their current address and passport details.They have to visit a police station annually to comply with notification requirements, and to inform the authorities of any change to personal details.If any of these personal details change, they must notify the police within three days or offenders can face up to five years in prison. Chief Constable Michelle Skeer, national lead for the management of sex offenders, said whilst anybody could change their name, these additional legislative obligations were monitored closely.Della Wright wants sex offenders to be banned from changing their name once they are added to the register.She was abused at the age of six by Terry Price, who was sentenced in 2017 to 22 years in prison with a five-year extension after being found guilty of sex offences involving children.Image caption, Mister Mac, now aged 60, was known as Terry Price when he abused Della WrightNow aged 60, he had changed his name before going on to offend again, as well as changing his name again between court hearings to Mister Mac. She says the system is ""far too simplistic"" and ""open to abuse.""""It shouldn´t be for victims and survivors to beg Government to do something about this. We´re still having to ask in 2023.""""It affects everything,"" she said of her abuse.  ""Since the court case, my whole world has become very small. I used to like music and festivals but I don´t go anywhere. I can´t travel by myself."" Ms Wright, from Warwickshire, who has waived her right to anonymity, said: ""We put our faith in DBS but it´s a false sense of security.""Image caption, Survivor Lauren-Eden Sullivan said her experience would never leave herAt the age of 14, Lauren-Eden Sullivan was abused by her biological father, Shaun Dallisson. She has also waived her right to anonymity.He was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2014 but has changed his name and moved to a new area since being released on licence. She says that registered sex offenders shouldn´t be able to change their names.""It´s not something that ever leaves the victim so why should the person that´s done it be able to escape it so easily,"" she said.Image caption, Lauren-Eden Sullivan said her abuse by Shaun Dallisson led her to ´spiral´ as a teenager into taking drugsDonald Findlater, director at the Lucy Faithfull Foundation charity, which is dedicated to preventing child sexual abuse, said some offenders changed their name to build a better life and not offend in future, or to ""protect their family from the stigma of their identity"".He said the 1,500 sex offenders who notified police forces of lawful name changes was ""exactly as it should be"" because they followed the rules.The former chief of Derbyshire police, Mick Creedon, was appointed in March by then-Home Secretary Priti Patel to review the police´s management of registered sex offenders.A separate internal review was also carried out into the scale and nature of offenders changing their name. The Home Office said ministers were considering both reports but have not published the findings.Ms Champion said: ""It´s troubling that money and resources are being spent on this and we have seen no tangible results or conclusions.""Basically, this issue has been dumped in the ´too difficult´ drawer.""A Home Office spokesperson said it had strengthened its regime for managing offenders through the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act.The act made it easier to impose restrictions via civil orders called Sexual Harm Prevention Orders for anyone convicted or cautioned for a sexual or violent offence.Courts can also impose Sexual Risk Orders which can be applied to any individual shown to pose a risk of sexual harm in the UK or abroad.The BBC´s Freedom of Information requests also highlighted over the same three-year period:There had been more than 5,500 offences committed by sex offenders of failing to comply with notification requirements such as not telling police they were living in a household with a child. Thirty-two police forces provided that data.The Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS) found 2,190 applicants for checks had criminal records and they had supplied incorrect or missed out personal details such as past names or aliases.The BBC can also reveal a total of 6,740 prosecutions began over the past three financial years for offences by sex offenders of breaches of a sexual harm prevention order or interim order.If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story help and support is available via the BBC Action LineMore about this storyThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.For more information on methodology, click here.

WhatsApp: Rather be blocked in UK than weaken security - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Shiona McCallum and Chris VallanceTechnology reportersWhatsApp says it would rather be blocked in the UK than undermine its encrypted-messaging system, if required to do so under the Online Safety Bill.Its head, Will Cathcart, said it would refuse to comply if asked to weaken the privacy of encrypted messages.The app Signal previously said it could stop providing services in the UK if the bill required it to scan messages.The government said it is possible to have both privacy and child safety.WhatsApp is the most popular messaging platform in the UK, used by more than seven in 10 adults who are online, according to communication regulator Ofcom.Child-abuse materialEnd-to-end encryption scrambles messages so even the company running the service cannot view the contents.But critics of the Online Safety Bill say it grants Ofcom the power to require private encrypted-messaging apps and other services to adopt ""accredited technology"" to identify and remove child-abuse material.Undermining the privacy of WhatsApp messages in the UK would do so for all users, Mr Cathcart said.""Our users all around the world want security - 98% of our users are outside the UK, they do not want us to lower the security of the product,"" he said. And the app would rather accept being blocked in the UK.""We´ve recently been blocked in Iran, for example. We´ve never seen a liberal democracy do that,"" he added.´Push back´Signal president Meredith Whittaker previously told BBC News it ""would absolutely, 100% walk"" and stop providing services in the UK if required by the bill to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging system.She later tweeted she was ""looking forward to working with @wcathcart and others to push back"".A day later, Mr Cathcart replied: ""And very important we work together (and honoured to get to do so) to push back.""Skip twitter post by Will CathcartWe feel the same.  And very important we work together (and honored to get to do so) to push back.https://t.co/PhP8Iz2GxW— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) March 2, 2023
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.End of twitter post by Will CathcartAsked if he would go as far as Signal, Mr Cathcart said: ""We won´t lower the security of WhatsApp. We have never done that - and we have accepted being blocked in other parts of the world."" And he feared the UK would set an example other nations might follow.""When a liberal democracy says, ´Is it OK to scan everyone´s private communication for illegal content?´ that emboldens countries around the world that have very different definitions of illegal content to propose the same thing,"" Mr Cathcart said.´Breeding ground´The government, and prominent child-protection charities, have long argued encryption hinders efforts to combat the growing problem of online child abuse.""It is important that technology companies make every effort to ensure that their platforms do not become a breeding ground for paedophiles,"" the Home Office said.The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) says research shows grooming and child-abuse-image crimes recorded in the UK have increased dramatically.The charity´s Richard Collard said the Online Safety Bill ""will rightly make it a legal requirement for platforms to identify and disrupt child sexual abuse taking place on their sites and services and companies could be preparing by developing technological solutions that protect the safety and privacy of all users, not least that of child abuse victims"".""Experts have demonstrated that it´s possible to tackle child-abuse material and grooming in end-to-end encrypted environments,"" he added. Image source, Getty ImagesThe government said: ""The Online Safety Bill does not represent a ban on end-to-end encryption.""It is not a choice between privacy or child safety - we can and we must have both.""But critics say the only way to check the contents of encrypted messages for child-sexual-abuse material would be to have services scan them on a device such as a phone before they are encrypted and sent. And this client-side scanning undermines the privacy encryption provides.Lawyer Graham Smith tweeted: ""You could argue that you don´t break a fence by digging round the end of it - literally true but where does it get you if the objecti[ve] is to trespass on private property? And once the hole has been dug, you might as well not have the fence.""´Mass-surveillance tool´And Mr Cathcart asked: ""If companies installed software on to people´s phones and computers to scan the content of their communications against a list of illegal content, what happens when other countries show up and give a different list of illegal content?""Dr Monica Horten, of digital-rights campaigners the Open Rights Group, said: ""With over 40 million users of encrypted chat services in the UK, this turns it into a mass-surveillance tool, with potentially damaging consequences for privacy and free-expression rights.""The Information Commissioner´s Office, which says it is working closely with Ofcom, told BBC News any interventions that could weaken encryption must be ""necessary and proportionate"". ""Where less intrusive measures are available, they should be used,"" it said. And it supported ""technological solutions that facilitate the detection of illegal content without undermining privacy protections for everyone"".Related TopicsOnline Safety BillSocial mediaWhatsAppEnd-to-end encryption",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64863448,09,03,2023,bbc,uk
Russia and Ukraine extend grain deal despite disagreement - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, ReutersImage caption, The UN says nearly 25 million tonnes of grain have left Ukraine under the dealBy Sarah FowlerBBC NewsA deal allowing Ukraine to export millions of tonnes of grain through the Black Sea despite the ongoing conflict with Russia has been extended.But it is unclear how long it will last, with Ukraine pushing for 120 days, and Russia calling for 60 days.Russia has warned it will not allow the deal to go on longer unless sanctions against Moscow are softened.The UN and Turkey helped broker the export agreement last July following fears of a global food crisis. Ukraine is one of the world´s top producers of grain, but its access to ports in the Black Sea was blocked by Russian warships following the invasion in February last year.Countries that suffer with food insecurity, such as Yemen, rely heavily on these supplies. What is the Ukraine grain deal and is it working?Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced an agreement on extending the deal on Saturday, with hours to go before it was due to expire.""This deal is of vital importance for the global food supply. I thank Russia and Ukraine, who didn´t spare their efforts for a new extension, as well as the United Nations secretary general,"" he said.But neither Mr Erdogan nor the UN clarified how long it would last. Ukraine wanted it to be extended for 120 days, but Russia said it was only willing to renew the pact for another 60 days.Vassily Nebenzia, Russia´s ambassador to the UN, said on Friday that the EU, UK and US had two months to remove any sanctions targeting Russia´s agricultural sector if they wanted the deal to continue.Moscow wants Russian producers to be able to export more food and fertiliser to the rest of the world, but says Western sanctions are preventing them.While food and fertiliser exports have not been targeted, Russia says restrictions on payments, insurers and shippers makes exports difficult.Russia briefly withdrew from the deal in November last year, accusing Ukraine of attacking its fleet in the Crimea - but it re-joined a few days later.According to the UN, the deal has already allowed nearly 25 million tonnes of foodstuffs from Ukraine´s Black Sea ports reach global markets.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warTurkeyFood",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65000324,18,03,2023,bbc,uk
When are passport office strikes and how to renew your UK passport? - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesPassport office workers will go on strike for five weeks between 3 April to 5 May in England, Scotland and Wales - in a dispute about jobs, pay and conditions.Those working in Belfast will strike from 7 April to 5 May.A quarter of the Passport Office´s 4,000 employees are expected to walk out. What does that mean if you need to get a new passport?How do I renew my passport?You can renew your passport online, at a cost of £82.50 (payable by debit or credit card) or by post, at a cost of £93.For a child passport (under 16), the fee is £53.50 for an online application and £64 for a postal one. To apply online, you will need your existing passport and a digital photograph. To apply by post, you will need to fill out a form which you can get from any post office which has a check and send service, or by calling the Passport Adviceline.You will need 2 new and identical printed photos of yourself.The Passport Office recommends you have your photos taken in a booth or at a photo shop because they are more likely to pass the standards for a passport photo.A photo taken in these places will come with a code that you can use to upload the pictures to your online application.If you take your photographs at home, you will need someone else to take them using a digital camera, tablet or smartphone.There are strict standards for a passport photo, which you can read here.You will need to have one of two new print photos validated if renewing a passport for a child aged 11 or under, or if you are renewing your own passport and you cannot be recognised from your existing passport.If you have unexpired visas in your existing passport, send it with the visa attached to it along with your application. Your previous passport will be returned to you and you will be able to use the visa if you carry both passports.How long does it take to renew a passport?The Passport Office says you should apply for a new passport 10 weeks before you are due to travel. If you can´t wait that long, you can pay extra to get it sooner. There are two services available.A one-week Fast Track service for renewing a passport, replacing a lost or stolen one or applying for a child passport. It costs £155 for an adult passport and £126 for a child passport. You will need to get an application form from a Post Office and book an appointment online.  An Online Premium service for renewing a passport, at a cost of £193.50. The earliest you can get an appointment (where you will receive your new passport) is two days after applying online. If you need a passport urgently or for medical treatment or because a friend or family member is seriously ill or has died, the government advice is to call the Passport Adviceline .When do I need to renew my passport?If you are travelling abroad, you need to renew your passport if it has expired or if it does not have enough time left on it. How much time you need on your passport depends on the country you are planning to visit. You can check this on the government website. For Spain, France, Greece and other popular summer destinations in the EU, your passport needs to be valid for at least three months after the date you plan to leave the country you are visiting. And your passport should be issued less than 10 years before the date you are planning to enter Spain or another EU country. How will the strike affect renewal time?The government says the strike does not affect their guidance which is still to allow up to ten weeks to get a passport.This advice has been in place since April 2021. Previously, the guidance was to allow three to six weeks, depending on the type of application.On 6 February 2023, Home secretary Suella Braverman told MPs: ""Last week, approximately 97% of all UK applications were completed within three weeks"" but added ""customers should continue to allow 10 weeks, and I urge people to apply in good time, not at the last minute, to avoid delays"".A Home Office spokesperson responded to the planned strikes:""We are disappointed with the union´s decision to strike after engaging in constructive talks to find a resolution.""We are working to manage the impact of strike action whilst ensuring we can continue to deliver vital services to the public, with comprehensive contingency plans in place.""Image caption, Passport queue in 2022In 2022, hundreds of thousands of people waited more than 10 weeks to receive their passports. This was due to a surge in demand, as coronavirus travel restrictions were lifted.There were more than seven million passport applications between January and September 2022. The busiest month was May when more than 1.2m requests for passports were submitted.Related TopicsPassport OfficeTop Stories´It´s personal for him´: What Putin saw in MariupolPublished3 hours agoUBS agrees ´emergency rescue´ of Credit SuissePublished40 minutes agoWhat Xi and Putin want from their Moscow meetingPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesExtradited to the UK for a 41-year-old pub brawlIs France´s government doomed by the pension crisis?The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go homeWhy Egyptians are being asked to eat chicken feetSamara Joy brought back old-school jazz.

What photo ID do you need to vote in UK elections? - BBC News,"Related TopicsEngland local elections 2023By Lauren PottsBBC NewsPeople in England will need to show photo ID before being allowed to vote at the local elections on 4 May.The government said the new law will help prevent voter fraud but critics claim the changes will make it harder for some to vote.What are the new voter ID rules?Voters need to take photo ID to get their ballot paper in polling stations at local elections, police and crime commissioner elections, and parliamentary by-elections.From October it will also apply to any general elections that are held in the future.You don´t need to show ID if voting by post. Why do I need ID to vote?The government said the measure is to stop votes being stolen, although this is quite unusual in the UK.Police investigated 315 cases of alleged voter fraud during local and parliamentary elections held in England, Wales and Scotland in May 2021, according to the Electoral Commission. A caution was issued in one case. The commission said in the past five years there had been ""no evidence of large-scale electoral fraud"", though some Conservative MPs claim the statistics underplay the issue. What documents can you show as photo ID?There are 22 forms of accepted ID. The main ones are:Passport issued by the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, a European Economic Area (EEA) state or a Commonwealth countryProvisional or full driving licence issued by the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateOthers include:A Blue BadgeOlder or Disabled Person´s Bus Pass funded by the UK governmentOyster 60+ Card funded by the UK governmentIdentity card bearing the Proof of Age Standards Scheme hologram (a PASS card)What if I don´t have an acceptable form of ID?You could exchange a paper driving licence for a photocard or apply for a photocard travel pass if you´re aged 60 or over, disabled, or registered blind or partially sighted.But if you don´t have the right photo ID, or the picture doesn´t look like you anymore, you can apply for a free voter ID document, known as a Voter Authority Certificate.You´ll need to provide your name, date of birth, address, and a recent passport-style digital photograph.You´ll also be asked for your National Insurance number but if you don´t know it, or don´t have one, a birth certificate, bank statement or utility bill will do.How do I apply for a voter ID document?First you need to register to vote. You can do that online or by filling in a paper form and the deadline is 23:59 GMT on Monday 17 April.You can then apply for a voter ID document online or by post. The deadline to apply is 17:00 GMT on Tuesday 25 April 2023.Why has voter ID been criticised?The plan was put forward by the Conservative-led government to ""protect the integrity of the ballot box"".Although most people have some form of accepted photo ID, an estimated 2m people don´t, and opposition MPs believe the changes will make it more difficult for them to vote.The Electoral Commission said it creates a barrier to those who vote anonymously and people who are disabled, older, experiencing homelessness, trans or non-binary, or from Gypsy, Roma or Traveller backgrounds.And the Electoral Reform Society suggested younger voters might be disproportionately affected - highlighting that older people can use bus passes and 60+ Oyster cards as ID but young people can´t use railcards or student Oyster cards.Has voter ID been trialled before?In England, it was trialled at the 2018 and 2019 local elections. In both years, participating councils required voters to bring a form of identification. The Electoral Commission said many of the people who were refused a ballot for not having ID did return with it later and the number of those that didn´t was fairly small. Elsewhere, photo ID has been mandatory in Northern Ireland since 2003 due to high levels of in-person electoral fraud and a free electoral ID card was created. And most European countries require residents to have national ID regardless, meaning no groups of people are discriminated against at the polls. In the US, 35 states require some form of ID to vote but only about half of those specify it must be photo ID.

Firm that lost satellite in Cornwall launch lambasts UK red tape - BBC News,"Image source, Spaceport CornwallImage caption, The LauncherOne rocket was lost along with its payload of nine satellitesA firm which lost a satellite on Virgin Orbit´s failed Spaceport Cornwall launch said UK space regulation needs to undergo ""seismic change"".Parliament´s Science and Technology Committee heard ""devastating"" evidence from Space Forge, based in Cardiff.The company had one of nine satellites on board the ´Start Me Up´ mission that failed to reach orbit in January.Greg Clark, committee chairman, said evidence showed regulation was putting the UK ""behind the rest of the world"". UK space regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said changes could be made but safety was ""not negotiable"".Meanwhile, Melissa Quinn, Head of Spaceport Cornwall, told the committee the fact they had ""got to space"" for the first time ever from a ""small regional airport"" in Cornwall was ""inspirational"".She added that they were ""licensed and ready"" for a second launch. Image caption, Crowds had been waiting in anticipation to hear the launch was a successA dislodged fuel filter was behind January´s failure of the first attempt to launch satellites into orbit from the UK, Virgin Orbit said.MPs heard the CAA´s regulatory procedure could deter future missions. Patrick McCall, non-executive director at Space Forge, said: ""The CAA is taking a different approach to risk, and a bit to process and timing as well.""But I think unless there is, without wanting to be too dramatic, a seismic change in that approach, the UK is not going to be competitive from a launch perspective.""Joshua Western, chief executive of the company, told the committee: ""Quite frankly it costs us more to licence our satellite for launch than it did to launch it.""Image caption, Joshua Western from Space Forge said the regulatory process was time consuming and expensiveHe said the portal for applications and email correspondence was taking up to six weeks, suggesting there is a lack of engagement with UK authorities.Spaceport Cornwall was awarded an operating licence in November 2022, but further technical and regulatory issues meant the launch was pushed into 2023. The licences for Virgin Orbit were granted on 21 December, with additional ones for the individual satellites being announced on 5 January.The Start Me Up mission launched on 9 January, and was progressing as planned until an ""anomaly"" meant the payload  being carried by the LauncherOne rocket were lost into the Atlantic Ocean.Image caption, Melissa Quinn also gave evidence at the hearingGreg Clark, chairman of the committee told CAA representatives the evidence from Space Forge and Virgin Orbit had been ""devastating"". He said: ""Something that was a strategic priority for this country to be ahead of the world, we´ve heard evidence from investors and operators to say that their experience of regulation here has put us behind the rest of the world.""Image source, ReutersImage caption, Melissa Quinn from Spaceport Cornwall said the failed mission was still a ""huge moment""Sir Stephen Hillier, chairman of the CAA, said the regulator had to enact the legislation but conceded licence applicants had to deal with ""multifarious agencies"".He said safety was not negotiable, but welcomed encouragement to ""move faster"".Tim Johnson, director for space regulation at the CAA, said: ""Helping develop a safe and thriving UK space industry is a key part of our work as the space regulator.""Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Inside the UK's Mormon missionary bootcamp - BBC News,"Image caption, Rebekah CooperBy Harvey DayBBC NewsEvery year, thousands of young Mormons go on missions to try to recruit others into the religion. The BBC was given access to their UK boot camp, where they learn how to teach Mormon beliefs and use social media to reach potential converts.When 19-year-old Rebekah Cooper started her mission, she had to give up her first name, stop making phone calls to her friends and surrender any time to be on her own, other than to use the toilet or shower. Known only as Sister Cooper during her religious mission, she also began a strictly-planned daily schedule - of prayer, study, exercise, volunteering in the community and seeking out potential converts - starting at 06:30 every morning and ending with a nightly curfew. Along with general Mormon rules based on religious scriptures like a ban on premarital sex and drinking tea and coffee, missionaries aren´t allowed to stay out late or watch TV or movies. Typical Gen Z pastimes like gaming and TikTok are also forbidden. Rebekah is one of tens of thousands of young Mormons around the world who volunteer to take part in missions every year, with the goal of recruiting others to join the religious group. Most are aged under 25 and live away from home for up to two years - and the biggest training centre in Europe for these young missionaries is located in Chorley, Lancashire. TV cameras were allowed into the training centre for a BBC documentary The Mormons Are Coming. Officially known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), the Church believes in Jesus but is separate from other Christian groups. It has more than 16 million members and has the largest full-time missionary force in the world. Awareness of these young missionaries has grown in recent years thanks to the Broadway and West End musical - The Book of Mormon. Some missionaries even try to find converts by speaking to theatre-goers outside of venues putting on the production. Image caption, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple and training centre in Chorley, LancashireRebekah says the strict life of a missionary is ""a completely different lifestyle"" to that of an everyday Mormon. ""Even though I´d grown up in the church, it was still a very big lifestyle change for me.""President Ostler, who oversees the missionaries at the training centre in Chorley, adds: ""Missionary life is very different from a normal young adult´s life - and they´re up for that.""´Sometimes you feel like an influencer´Rebekah says being brought up in the LDS Church was, at times, ""tough"" - and she felt ""very different to my peers"" when she was young.   But her religion also helped her through a period of anxiety and depression, after one of her classmates took his own life. ""It kind of set off a series of events where I realised not only did I have clinical depression [but I´d] had it all my life.""For about a year, Rebekah - from Tring, Hertfordshire - went through different types of treatment and says she struggled with her faith. She remembers spending one day crying and praying, until she eventually got a feeling that she should begin taking medication - something she had resisted to that moment. After that, ""everything just got better and I was a lot more stable,"" she says. ""It sounds a bit weird but there were a lot of little spiritual nudges to help me out.""It was this experience that convinced her to go on a mission. The Mormons Are ComingFollow three young Mormon missionaries through the first few months of training and work in the field - which can make or break them.Watch on Tuesday 28 February, 21:00 GMT on BBC Two - and  on BBC iPlayer.Friends of Rebekah´s had been sent to exciting international locations for their missions - and Lancashire wouldn´t have been her first choice. When she found out she wasn´t going overseas, she hid her phone away and refused to look at it. ""I was a little bitter for a few days,"" she says.Rebekah and her fellow young missionaries spent two weeks at England´s Missionary Training Centre in the grounds of the large Mormon temple in Chorley. It´s where she learned how to recruit new converts using a book called Preach My Gospel, which sets out the basics of the Church´s beliefs. They were also taught how to keep to a tight schedule for their work - using an app where they planned every minute of their days. Image source, InstagramImage caption, Missionaries are taught to create Instagram Reel videos to find potential convertsThe Chorley boot camp also teaches missionaries how to use social media to find people for conversion by creating targeted Instagram Reel videos and Facebook posts. And they´re expected to send at least 50 social media messages per day to potential converts, based on who has engaged or interacted with their posts.""It was a bit weird,"" Rebekah says. ""You had to be very public about your life and you were trying to get interactions from people. Sometimes you do kind of feel like an influencer.""Posting so many social media posts did have some downsides for Rebekah, including being mocked online. She remembers feeling ""upset"" and ""lonely"" after someone shared one of her posts with the caption: ""The psychos are at it again."" ""It just made me so sad,"" she says. ""Little things like that make it really tough.""During missions, internet use is closely monitored and is strictly limited to only missionary work. ""Once you´re on your mission, your phone is not a source of entertainment, it´s your job,"" Rebekah says. At the Chorley training centre, the missionaries are assigned with their first companion who they´ll later live and spend all their time with. Over the course of a mission, they´ll be assigned to other companions. Rebekah was first assigned to live with two companions in a flat in Wrexham - which, she says, was so small the bedroom only had room for two bed frames with a third missionary sleeping on a mattress on the floor.  ""It was very cramped. I think I did struggle to find my space, at first. It was hard to adjust to.""Image caption, Missionaries outside the opening night of the Book of Mormon musical in LiverpoolSpeaking to the public on the street or over the phone during the mission could also be difficult, Rebekah says. While most people find the missionaries to be ""quite friendly"", she says some members of the public don´t like them, and end up arguing with them and calling them crazy. Some people on the street also give out friends´ phone numbers as a prank, which can lead to the missionaries being shouted and sworn at when they call to make contact.But Rebekah remembers being given one phone number, which she assumed would be a prank, for someone who turned out to be genuine - 19-year-old car mechanic Josh. ""We spoke about the Book of Mormon,"" Rebekah says, ""and from then on he just wanted to learn more."" After five weeks, Josh was invited to be baptised into the Church. Back to post-missionary lifeThe most difficult part of missionary life for Rebekah was not being able to speak to her friends back home. She also struggled to find things to do in her limited free time - at home, she´d spend a lot of time on her computer or playing on her Xbox. There were positives to this, though, like not having to read the news for months. ""I´m actually very grateful I had that time away from the world.""And Rebekah says she picked up a lot of confidence from her mission. ""I think you have to, because you´re just thrown into these situations to either sink or swim.""Image caption, Elder Peter JohnsonPeter Johnson, president of the Church´s Manchester mission and responsible for Rebekah and her fellow missionaries, says the strict missionary standards ""help them to be more productive"".  ""Missionary life is one of discipline and commitment and focus,"" he adds, ""but those are the same attributes they´ll have to use throughout their lives, whether in a job or in school."" Now she has returned to normal life, Rebekah is hoping to study psychology and child development at university. And she´s still getting used to post-missionary habits, like being on her own again after spending so much time with a church companion.""It´s hard not having someone around me constantly. I´d go out to the shops by myself and it would feel really wrong. That was a weird change to get used to again.""Watch The Mormons Are Coming on Tuesday 28 February, 21:00 GMT on BBC Two and on BBC iPlayer.BBC images courtesy: Peggy Pictures/Dan Harrison/Sky High AerialRelated TopicsChorleyMormonism",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64790111,28,02,2023,bbc,uk
"Northern Ireland Brexit deal: EU-UK mood music sweeter now, but could sour - BBC News","Related TopicsBrexitImage source, AFPBy Katya AdlerEurope editor@BBCkatyaadlerAre relations between the EU and the UK now ""fundamentally changed""? And, if yes, how fragile is this ""new relationship"" since the two sides agreed a revised Brexit deal on Northern Ireland?During their public unveiling of the deal on Monday, the atmosphere between the UK prime minister and the president of the European Commission was clearly warm.And neither of them are effusive types by nature.""Dear Rishi"" was how Ursula von der Leyen addressed Rishi Sunak. He spoke enthusiastically of a new chapter in EU-UK relations. What a contrast to the bitter bilateral Brexit wrangles of old.But as a slightly cynical, first-hand observer of the now years-long EU-UK post-Brexit convulsions, I wondered if this mutual admiration was genuine or part of their carefully choreographed joint appearance.After speaking to a number of diplomats on both sides of the Channel - I think it was a mixture of both. I can´t name the contacts who spoke to me. They did so on the understanding our conversations were off the record.""Rishi Sunak is the first UK prime minister we´ve trusted in six years (since the start of the Brexit process),"" one influential EU figure told me. You can´t really claim to know Mr Sunak, I countered. He hasn´t been long in the job.But what EU politicians like about the prime minister is that he seems solutions-focused and a straight talker.""You can see he used to be a no-nonsense banker,"" said one EU figure.""Unlike his predecessors, he didn´t come to Brussels to play politics - rubbishing us back home in the UK, in order to score political points,"" was the opinion of another. ""Sunak´s a Brexiteer, we know that, but he´s an outward-looking pragmatist. Not an ideologue. He saw advantages in getting a deal done (on Northern Ireland) and he got down to business with us.""Co-operating closely on Northern Ireland went a long way to healing years of broken post-Brexit trust.European alliesIn the wider picture, EU-UK relations have also been normalising ever since Russia invaded Ukraine. It´s been a reminder of the values and priorities they share as they´ve worked together on sanctions and on aiding Kyiv militarily.On the Northern Ireland Protocol though, each side made compromises but likes to intimate it did particularly well out of this revised deal.The EU whispers this conviction a little more quietly, intentionally taking a backseat role. Watching, waiting and hoping Rishi Sunak manages to sell the deal back home.Brussels doesn´t want to be seen as interfering in what is now a UK domestic debate. Northern Ireland Brexit deal: At-a-glanceDon´t create drama over Brexit deal, PM tells ToriesAfter the EU Commission president´s exuberant show of good faith in Rishi Sunak on Monday, she disappeared on the subject. No sit-down interviews with the UK press. No proclamations from Paris or Berlin either.But Brussels shares the prime minister´s conviction that this is the right deal for all parties in Northern Ireland. For the long-term.Neither side is now open to making extra changes. They insist all the mechanisms are in place to deal with concerns or problems if and when they arise.What brought the EU and UK together was a shared concern for the people, businesses and communities of Northern Ireland, Brussels figures say.""Our priorities matched: we both wanted to make life better in Northern Ireland, protect the peace process there, while also protecting our respective internal markets (the EU single market and the UK internal market)."" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Post-Brexit rules on Northern Ireland border checks have been a thorny issueTiming was also key - it´s the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement next month.""The ticking clock focused our minds,"" I´ve been told.US influenceEU diplomats say the US was also ""very helpful in keeping up the pressure"".President Joe Biden often mentions his Irish roots. He told the UK, hungry for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington, that if it acted unilaterally on Northern Ireland - ignoring its treaty with the EU - that would hinder its chances of reaching an accord with the US.The EU Commission president is a keen Atlanticist, as are the majority of UK leaders. Rishi Sunak hopes this revised deal with the EU will encourage the power-sharing government in Northern Ireland to get up and running again in time for the April anniversary, and that, in turn, will encourage Joe Biden to come over to mark the occasion.All tantalising prospects for the UK: political stability in Northern Ireland, improved relations with the US and with the EU. The latter heralding all sorts of other goodies as Ursula von der Leyen has been keen to point out. Restored trust facilitates new deals, she said, citing scientific research as one example. But also immigration, financial services and easing freer movement for UK musicians to perform across the EU.Image source, No 10 Downing StreetImage caption, All smiles at the Windsor talks on MondayA big Brussels figure I spoke to predicted future changes in EU-UK agreements will likely centre around the wider post-Brexit trade deal, known as the TCA. ""That´s where the vast amount of trade between our two sides is dealt with, and that´s where, over time, we can mutually smooth out bumps in the roads - like easing checks in Calais.""All the above would be multiple coups for the quiet prime minister who entered Downing Street with his Conservative Party riven by division, facing a slumping economy and trailing in public opinion polls.But we´re not there yet. First the UK would need to approve the revised Northern Ireland agreement. If it doesn´t, this sweeter mood music with the EU could quickly turn sour.""We (Brussels) would demand the UK immediately implement our original joint agreement - signed by Boris Johnson - in full,"" is what you hear in EU corridors. There would be no more grace periods, accepted by Brussels up till now.And what if the UK government then reverted to an earlier threat to unilaterally ignore that international agreement, or key parts of it? Then a looming costly trade war with the EU - still the UK´s biggest trade partner - could be back on the table in a flash.Something Rishi Sunak has been keen to avoid from the outset.

She had stabbed her victim 17 times.In 2004 she was moved to an open prison but was later returned to a closed one due to concerns about her behaviour.Image source, North News/NNPImage caption, Janet Newton was stabbed 17 times by Maria Pearson in 1986In 2014 she took part in a programme to help her with her decision-making but admitted to the parole panel she had told facilitators ""what she thought they wanted to hear"".She later declined to engage with some professional services which were supposed to help her, but in 2020 she decided she would engage with support to help people with complex behavioural problems.That year the parole board decided she could move to an open prison, which she did in June 2021, but three months later she moved back to a closed jail.Her release plan had included a requirement to live in designated accommodation as well as strict curbs on her contacts, movements and activities, which Pearson was reported to be unhappy with.

Emergency coal power plants used for first time as UK sees cold snap - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesTwo old coal-fired power plants have begun generating again as the UK expects to see its coldest night of the year so far. The plants had been put on standby in case of shortfalls, but started feeding power into the grid this afternoon. National Grid blamed high demand and a shortage of electricity from other sources.The coal plants began operating in 1966 but were due to close last September. However, operators have kept them open for an extra six months at the request of the government, amid fears of possible power shortages.Temperatures are expected to drop to -15C (5F) in some parts of the UK on Tuesday evening, with snow sweeping parts of the country. The cold snap is expected to last for the next few days, with weather warnings in place across the UK. The two coal-powered stations that are in use again again are in West Burton in Nottinghamshire. Snow blankets parts of the UK as cold snap startsSnow and ice warnings extended to more parts of UK Two further contingency coal fired units, at Drax power station in Yorkshire, were ordered to get ready for use as well earlier in the day but have now been stood down. National Grid has a total of five coal-fired generating units on standby - the other is at Ratcliffe on Soar.The extra generating capacity was lined up this week due to concerns that the margin between supply and demand was becoming too narrow. National Grid blames the cold weather, a shortage of wind and solar power generation, and a lack of electricity available through interconnectors from France due to strike action in the country. However, plans to use the so-called demand flexibility service - which pays people to use less electricity - have been set aside. Although the cold weather is expected to continue tomorrow, the grid is expected to be under less strain because more electricity will be available through international undersea cables.Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and produces almost twice the emissions of natural gas.Gas and wind power have been replacing coal in powering the UK´s electricity supply over recent years. But this has been delayed by the government following concerns over the disruption to Russian gas supplies to Europe after Russia invasion of Ukraine. The coal-fired plants were due to close last autumn to move the UK towards more sustainable energy production.Coal-fired power generation accounted for 2% of the country´s electricity produced last year.

Gun violence in US and what the statistics tell us - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several yearsGun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against sectors of the population fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We´ve looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US.Mass shootings on the riseThere have already been more than 70 mass shootings across the US so far this year, with California experiencing two of the most high-profile in January.Figures from the Gun Violence Archive - a non-profit research database - shows that the number of mass shootings has gone up significantly in recent years.In each of the last three years there have been more than 600 mass shootings, almost two a day on average. While the US does not have a single definition for ""mass shootings"", the Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figure includes shootings that happen both in homes and in public places.The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. How do US gun deaths break down?According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a total of 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries of all causes during 2020, the last year for which complete data is available.And while mass shooting and gun murders generally garner more media attention, of the total, more than half were suicides. In 2020, more than 19,000 of the deaths were homicides, according to the CDC. The figure represents a 34% increase from 2019, and a 75% increase over the course of the previous decade. The data also shows nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US.Provisional data for the following year suggests nearly 49,000 gun-related deaths in 2021.That´s a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018.The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. More recent data out of the US suggests that gun ownership grew significantly over the last several years. A study, published by the Annals of Internal Medicine in February, found that 7.5 million US adults became first new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. This, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. Who supports gun control?Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - support for stricter laws fell last year, although a majority of Americans are still in favour, according to polling by Gallup.57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 32% said they should remain the same. Ten percent surveyed said laws should be ""made less strict"".   The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,"" another Gallup study noted, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists.Who opposes gun control?Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy.  Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state´s residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in April last year Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit.  The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"".

World Cup: England fans frustrated after disappointing USA match - BBC News,"Image caption, Friends told Tessa Saraceno (left) that she should not wear a USA jerseyBy James Gregory in London and Alex Homer in StourbridgeBBC NewsIt was a frustrating night for England fans in east London as the Three Lions were held by the USA in their second group game of the Fifa World Cup.The match, a 19:00 kick-off, was the first England performance of the Qatar tournament many could watch with other supporters in a pub and followed the team´s 6-2 win over Iran. But it turned out a drab 0-0 draw.Some 500 people packed into Shoreditch´s Boxpark venue on Friday evening.Fans had been in good voice ahead of the match, spurred on by the DJ and a host of different competitions and challenges.George Shayle, 26, said he was the first person through the door at 15:00. He took a half-day from work so he could soak up some of the atmosphere before big screens started showing the match.""We´ve been watching every game,"" he said. ""You want to be a part of it,"" said Zac Okoisor, who also took time off work, arriving three hours before kick-off with friend Noah Sempala.Day of frustration for England and Wales in Qatar´England turn clock back to dismal summer but are still on track´What do England and Wales need to do to qualify?Noah watched the first England game on Monday while at work. But there was no way he was missing out this time, so he booked the whole day off. He had predicted an easy game for England, but that early optimism soon made way for frustration.""It was a bit boring, a bit disappointing,"" Noah said at half time. ""I thought we were going to run away with it but unfortunately not.""The 4-0 he had predicted at the start of the game looked a long way off. Image caption, Zac Okoisor, Jaye Akinola and Noah Sempala gather to watch the matchAt Stourbridge FC in the West Midlands, the final whistle was met with heads in hands, groans and flat post-match reviews.The most excited rush at the former youth club of England midfielder Jude Bellingham was on the toilets at half-time.Millie Rogers, first team women´s striker for Stourbridge FC for two seasons, thought a few changes in selection would help England going forward.Jackson Dilday, from South Carolina, said he was the only person in the bar supporting USA. Image caption, Jackson Dilday was pleased with the USA´s performanceIn his third year of studying coaching and analysis at the University of Wolverhampton, he was pleased with USA´s game plan and performance and felt the draw was nearly as good as a victory before the team play Iran.In Shoreditch, Tessa Saraceno was one of the few Americans at the venue.The 27 year old flew in from Chicago on Friday morning to visit her friends in London - although she had no idea there would be a big England-USA game when she planned the trip.Tessa was going to wear a US jersey for the game, until they intervened. ""They told me I was not allowed to wear a US shirt,"" she said. ""In the States, fans sit together and it´s banter."" Her friends told her it wasn´t the same over here.Did Tessa think the US had a chance at getting a result? ""Not at all,"" she said,Even so, Tessa said she would ""probably celebrate"" if the US scored.England remain firm favourites to qualify for the knockout stage, knowing they only need to avoid a four-goal defeat against Wales to progress.But there were loud boos at the stadium in Qatar, and many in Shoreditch seemed to echoed their sentiments.""It was a horrendous performance from the Three Lions,"" said Roberto Giurgila, 25.

TSA raises alarm amid increase in guns at US airports - BBC News,"Image source, TSAImage caption, A man on his way to Houston attempted to take this assault rifle onto his flight from New OrleansBy Chloe KimBBC News, Washington DCAn assault rifle and 163 rounds of ammunition taken from a man about to board a plane in New Orleans on Valentine´s Day is an example of a trend identified by US officials.In some parts of the country, more passengers are attempting to bring their guns through airport security.While 2022 was a record year for guns found at US airport checkpoints, the TSA says, 2023 may well beat it.Officers in Seattle, Washington DC and Indianapolis have all raised the alarm.The TSA intercepted a record 6,542 guns at airport checkpoints across the US last year. Some 88% of them were loaded with ammunition. Travellers are allowed to pack unloaded firearms inside checked luggage that typically goes into an aircraft´s hold. They are also required tell the airline they intend to travel with weapons at check-in.But guns are not allowed in carry-on bags or passenger cabins, even if a passenger has a concealed weapon permit.The TSA intercepts guns at airport security checkpoints and reports some airports are seeing a surge in numbers in some places that are ahead of comparable figures last year.The 14 February discovery in New Orleans was especially notable due to the volume of ammunition discovered - it was the second gun intercepted at the city´s airport that day.In January, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport saw three guns come through a TSA checkpoint in a single week. Indianapolis International Airport detected four separate loaded guns in one week.""It´s disturbing that so many Indianapolis passengers have made the irresponsible decision to bring a firearm to the checkpoint in just the first month of the year,"" says Aaron Batt, TSA´s Federal Security Director for Indiana. Image source, TSAImage caption, The 14 February discovery in New Orleans included 163 rounds of ammunitionIn Seattle, TSA officials counted 11 firearms discovered before the end of January, up from seven discovered by the same point in 2022.""This is not a new problem,"" according to Brian Schihabel, TSA Federal Security Director for Nebraska. ""But it is one that must be addressed since we have reached an unacceptable level of firearms coming through our security checkpoints."" He hopes the growing numbers serve as a wake-up call for those who choose to travel with firearms.Last year, the TSA raised the maximum civil penalty for a firearms violation to $14,950 (£12,419). Violators may also be arrested, have their weapons confiscated, and have their TSA PreCheck, the ability to skip normal security lines, revoked for at least five years. Yet numbers continue to go up. The TSA has intercepted more firearms every year since 2010 except for 2020, when the pandemic slowed travel worldwide. Experts suspect part of the problem may be simple to explain.""What we see in our checkpoints really reflects what we´re seeing in society,"" TSA administrator David Pekoske told the Associated Press. ""In society there are more people carrying firearms nowadays.""Related TopicsAirport securityFirearmsUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64710509,20,02,2023,bbc,usa
What lies behind a string of US airline near-misses? - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Sam CabralBBC News, WashingtonSurging demand for air travel and pandemic-fuelled workforce disruptions are likely to blame for a string of close calls on US airport runways.That´s according to leaders in the aviation industry, who met on Wednesday at an impromptu safety summit to address the spate of recent incidents.The gathering took place a day after the launch of yet another federal probe into a near-collision between planes.It is the seventh aviation incident to be investigated this year alone.Federal officials are currently reviewing six ""runway incursions"" - as well as one plane´s terrifying nosedive and near-plunge into the Pacific Ocean - for root causes and commonalities.The latest near-miss occurred on 7 March at Washington DC´s Reagan National Airport, when a Republic Airways flight crossed a runway without clearance and forced a United Airlines flight that had already been cleared for departure to abort its take-off.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is investigating the incident, said an air traffic controller had intervened to safely re-route the United pilot.Officials investigate latest close call at US airportUS to investigate Boeing 777´s mysterious nosediveOfficials at Wednesday´s FAA-hosted safety summit in the Washington area agreed there had been an ""uptick"" in incidents, with several calling for the near-misses to be treated like real accidents.""The absence of a fatality or an accident doesn´t mean the presence of safety,"" said Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ""There´s always more we can do to improve safety.""The emergency summit - the first of its kind in 14 years, according to CBS News - is seen as a ""call to action"" for the industry and an opportunity to assess whether regulatory change is needed.""In light of these recent close calls and the attention being focused on even the most routine of go-arounds, are we emphasising efficiency over safety?"" acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen asked those attending.""America´s aviation safety net is strong... our obligation is to sew those threads even tighter,"" he said.But the problem, experts say, is that airlines are still recovering from the tumult of the past three years. Not only did the pandemic fuel early retirements, mass layoffs and financial distress across the industry, but airlines went from haemorrhaging money at the start of the outbreak to being awash with customers desperate to make up for lost travel time.According to Laura Einsetler, a commercial airline pilot with over 30 years of flying experience, the last time the industry suffered such a serious jolt was the 9/11 terror attacks, an event she argues took the sector more than a decade to recover from.""What we´re seeing now, over the past year, is this really fast ramp-up of air travel and we´re trying to quickly replace that loss of 20-25% of our workers [during the pandemic] by hiring people and trying to get them up to speed right now,"" she told the BBC.It all amounts to a strained aviation sector, she said, because elevated demand for air travel is probably coinciding with an overworked and under-experienced workforce.Panellists at Wednesday´s summit noted, for example, that there are 1,200 fewer air traffic controllers across the US now than there were a decade ago.""The pressure is always there to get as many of us in and out of the airports as possible,"" Mrs Einsetler added. ""We need to slow down and be situationally aware.""Data from the FAA shows that, while the most serious airline close calls have declined over the past two decades and there have been no fatal commercial flight accidents since 2009, the total number of incidents has grown.Nevertheless safety experts insist it remains safe to fly in the US, arguing that widely reported recent near-misses only account for a fraction of the 45,000 flights that take place every day.""We in the US have a very safe air transportation system,"" said Dr Hassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the independent Flight Safety Foundation non-profit.""What we need to do is to make sure that we understand the root causes of these incidents and that the industry is coming together to address them in the near-term.""You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Video shows aftermath of violent turbulence on flightRelated TopicsAviation accidents and incidentsAviation safetyAir travelUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64967308,17,03,2023,bbc,usa
US and Canada abandon search for three flying objects shot down - BBC News,"Image source, US militaryImage caption, While the alleged Chinese ´spy balloon´ was located, the search for three other objects was cancelledThe US and Canada have abandoned the search for three of the four flying objects shot down by US fighter jets during the first two weeks of February.The US had found the remains of an alleged Chinese spy balloon that it shot down on 4 February, but officials now say they have ended the search for three smaller objects shot down later.Washington has said these were probably civilian-owned balloons.""Systematic searches"" over Alaska, Lake Huron and the Yukon found no debris.These searches were unsuccessful despite the US military, federal agencies and Canadian partners searching each area using airborne imagery, a variety of sensors, and below-surface scans, said Washington´s Northern Command.The object shot down over Canada´s Yukon ""was not tied to a scenario that justifies extraordinary search efforts"", the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in a statement.Other factors behind the decision to end the search included snowfall and a ""decreasing probability"" the object would be found, they added.US suspects three objects were ´benign´ How has China reacted?On 7 February, the US collected sensors and other debris from the alleged Chinese surveillance balloon shot down on 4 February.National security spokesman John Kirby said late on Friday that there was a ""significant amount"" of recovered material, including the ""payload structure as well as some of the electronics and the optics"". He added the material had now been sent to an FBI laboratory.""We´re going to learn even more, we believe, by getting a look at the guts inside it and seeing how it worked and what it was capable of,"" he said.The US military believes the recovered sensors and electronics may give clues about Beijing´s alleged surveillance operation.China continues to deny that it sent a spy balloon.Related TopicsSpyingChinaUnited StatesCanada",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64687038,18,02,2023,bbc,usa

Officials investigate latest close call at US airport - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The incident is the latest in a string of reported near-collisions on US airport runwaysAviation officials are investigating a close call between two planes at Ronald Reagan Airport in Washington, DC. On 7 March, a Republic Airways flight crossed the runway without clearance after a United Airlines flight had just been cleared for take off.An air traffic controller responded by immediately cancelling take off for the United flight, the Federal Aviation Agency said. The incident is the latest in a string of close calls across US airports.In a statement to the BBC, the FAA confirmed that it was investigating the incident involving Republic Airways Flight 4736, bound for Raleigh, and United Airlines Flight 2003, bound for Chicago. The pilot of the Republic Airways flight was cleared to cross the runway but turned on the wrong taxiway, the agency said. The incident occurred around 08:30 local time. Preliminary data from Flightradar24 shows the two planes were more than 2,300 feet apart at the time. The FAA said it was determining the closest distance between the aircrafts as part of the investigation. The news comes ahead of a FAA safety summit on Wednesday - the first to be held since 2009 - that will kickstart a sweeping review in the wake of several near-collisions at US airports.In January, the agency launched an investigation after two planes full of passengers nearly collided at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York City. One plane was about to take off while the other was crossing the same runway. The collision was averted when an air controller noticed the two.Another near-collision was reported in February between a FedEx cargo plane and a Southwest passenger flight at a Texas airport.

Al-Shabab: US air strike in Somalia 'kills 30 militants' - BBC News,"Image source, AFPImage caption, Al-Shabab is described by the US as a large terror networkA US air strike assisting government troops in Somalia has killed about 30 Islamist al-Shabab militants, the US military says.The operation happened near the town of Galcad, about 260km (162 miles) northeast of the capital Mogadishu.Over the past few days, the Somali army and al-Shabab militants have fought for control of the town.  Friday´s air strike came as the army was being attacked by more than 100 militants, the US Africa Command says.Earlier the Islamists killed seven soldiers after storming a military base in Galcad. Somalia´s Information Ministry said dozens of the militants were killed.  Al-Shabab has been fighting Somalia´s central government since 2006, aiming to impose an extremist Islamist regime. While it has been pushed out of Mogadishu and other areas it continues to attack military and civilian targets.Last Monday the government said its army and local militias had captured the port town of Harardhere, which had been a key al-Shabab supply centre since 2010.In its report on the Galcad fighting the US Africa Command said three al-Shabab vehicles were destroyed and ""the command assesses that no civilians were injured or killed"". The details have not been independently verified.""US Africa Command´s forces will continue training, advising and equipping partner forces to help give them the tools they need to defeat al-Shabab, the largest and most deadly al-Qaeda network in the world,"" the statement said.Related TopicsSomaliaal-ShababUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64362653,22,01,2023,bbc,usa

It was last spotted over Missouri.It is expected to reach America´s east coast near the Carolinas this weekend.The US has decided not to shoot down the high-altitude airship due to the danger of falling debris.The incident comes amid fraying tensions between the US and China.High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?In a statement on Saturday, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing ""never violated the territory and airspace of any sovereign country"".It said its senior foreign policy official Wang Yi had discussed the incident with Mr Blinken over the phone, stressing that maintaining communication channels at all levels was important, ""especially in dealing with some unexpected situations in a calm and reliable manner"". It added that Beijing ""would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype"" and accused ""some politicians and media in the United States"" of using the incident ""as a pretext to attack and smear China.""According to US officials, the airship floated over Alaska and Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.The incident angered top US officials, with Mr Blinken saying he had told Beijing the balloon´s presence was ""a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law"" and ""an irresponsible act"".

US accuses Google of 'driving out' ad rivals - BBC News,"Image source, AFPBy Chris VallanceTechnology reporter, BBC NewsThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) and eight US states have filed a case against Google alleging it has too much power over the online ad market.Its anti-competitive actions had ""weakened if not destroyed competition in the ad tech industry"", US Attorney General Merrick Garland said.Google accused the DOJ of ""doubling down on a flawed argument"".The case attempted to ""pick winners and losers"" in a competitive industry, the firm said.Online advertising accounts for the lion´s share of Google´s multibillion dollar revenue. Google is the market leader, but its slice of total US digital ad income has fallen from 36.7% in 2016 to 28.8% in 2022, according to market research firm Insider Intelligence.More paywallsMr Garland alleged that Google´s anti-competitive conduct extended into three key areas:It controls the technology used by nearly all major website publishers to offer ad space for sale. It controls the leading tool used by advertisers to buy ad space.It controls the largest ad exchange that matches publishers and advertisers.As a result of Google´s scheme, ""website creators earn less and advertisers pay more"", Mr Garland said.It meant that fewer publishers were able to offer content without subscriptions, paywalls, or other forms of monetisation.Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter alleged that the firm´s actions over 15 years had the effect of ""driving out rivals, diminishing competition, inflating advertising costs, reducing website publisher revenues, stymieing innovation and flattening our public marketplace of ideas"".But in a statement to the BBC Google said the legal action ""attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector.

US attaches childcare strings to chip-maker subsidies - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nursery care for toddlers can cost more than a third of the median family income in some parts of the US, the Labor Department saysThe White House has been frustrated in its efforts to expand national support for childcare. Now it is trying again - although on a smaller scale.Companies seeking to tap a new $40bn (£33bn) pool of government subsidies for the semiconductor industry will be required to submit plans for how they will provide workers with childcare.The condition marks an unusual use of the federal government´s powers. Officials said the rule was intended to address a worker shortage.The move comes as the US starts soliciting applications from firms for the first of the billions in subsidies for the chips industry that Congress approved last year to help the US compete with China. ""Here´s the truth: CHIPS won´t be successful unless we expand the labor force. We can´t do that without affordable child care,"" Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo wrote on Twitter. ""That´s why we´re requiring companies that receive funding to tell us how they plan to provide affordable child care for workers.""The number of people citing childcare problems as a reason for not working has surged since the pandemic hit in 2020, worsening shortages of a service that was already scarce and expensive. But the White House has not been able to muster support in Congress for boosting federal funds for the sector to increase pay for workers and expand pre-kindergarten programmes. The government typically requires that firms awarded contracts adhere to certain standards above and beyond the rules facing the private sector. Such moves are seen as influential, given the scale of the government´s presence as an employer.For example, federal contractors must pay a minimum hourly wage of $16.20, though that is above the minimum in some states.But the national government has not taken up the issue of childcare seriously in the past, said Danielle Ewen, a longtime education consultant.""It is a new avenue for the federal government to require employers in a particular industry to provide childcare,"" she said.The requirement stipulates that applicants seeking more than $150m in grants or other direct funding for chips manufacturing factories submit plans to provide workers at the plant and construction workers with access to ""affordable, accessible, reliable and high-quality childcare"".The agency did not specify how it would determine if companies meet that bar. Subsidising the cost of care risks straining existing resources, if more parents seek spots for their children but the supply remains the same. Analysts said more details would be necessary to understand the impact of the move, which stirred objections in some quarters.""Affordable childcare is an admirable goal - but it has nothing to do with semiconductors,"" investor Steven Rattner, who worked on the Obama administration´s rescue of the auto industry, wrote on Twitter. ""If we want the CHIPS act to work, it can´t be used as a pack mule for unrelated policy priorities.""Still, the move was cheered by others, such as Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.""Investing in our economy means investing in the workers who make it run,"" she said. The Semiconductor Association, which represents chips manufacturers, did not respond to a request for comment. The US has long looked to the private sector to supply benefits - such as health insurance - seen as the responsibility of governments in some other countries. About 28% of firms with more than 500 staff now offer some childcare benefits, according to an annual survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Money awarded via the semiconductor initiative can be put towards the cost, according to the New York Times, which first reported the requirement.  Angie Garling is vice president for Early Care and Education at Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF), which has worked with the city of San Francisco on its decades-old childcare initiative, which requires property developers to set aside space for childcare facilities or pay into a city fund in an effort to boost supply. ""The way to make this type of program successful is to ensure companies are putting the diverse child care needs of their employees front and center,"" she said. ""Employers must be part of the solution.""Related TopicsChildcareUS politicsUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64792718,28,02,2023,bbc,usa

FAA outage: US airline regulators blame contractor for travel chaos - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesBy Max MatzaBBC NewsUS air safety officials say that the glitch that led to travel chaos at airports last week was actually caused by a contractor deleting files on a crucial computer server used by pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the worker ""unintentionally deleted files"" on the Notice to Air Missions (Notam) database. The system alerts pilots to potential hazards on flight routes. They are required to check it before flights.Lawmakers vowed to look into the issue. More than 11,000 flights were delayed and at least 1,300 were cancelled on 11 January after the Notam system went offline a day earlier. The technical issues marked the first time since the attacks on 11 September 2001 that flights across the US were grounded.The FAA said that their contract employee, who was not identified, deleted the files while working to synchronise the primary and backup Notam databases.  Why did FAA ground flights across the US?Two planes nearly collide on US airport runway""The agency has so far found no evidence of a cyber-attack or malicious intent,"" the regulator said in its statement on Thursday.The FAA added that they were continuing to investigate the error. The system has been fixed, and the FAA ""has taken steps to make the Notam system more resilient,"" the statement said.The FAA had previously attributed the outage to a ""damaged database file"".Last week, a group of Washington DC lawmakers wrote to the FAA to say that the outage was ""completely unacceptable"" and demanding to know how it would be avoided in the future.

Family demands answers over daughter's death at US Army base - BBC News,"Image source, Pink BeretsImage caption, Ana Basalda Ruiz´s parents said she told them she was sexually harassed at her US military baseBy Madeline HalpertBBC News, New YorkThe parents of a female soldier who died at a US military base in Texas are raising questions after army officials said this week no foul play was suspected in her death. Pte Ana Basaldua Ruiz, a 20-year-old combat engineer stationed in Fort Hood died on Monday, the military said. Army officials told Pte Basaldua Ruiz´s parents she died by suicide, Telemundo reported. Her parents said Pte Basaldua Ruiz said she had been sexually harassed. The US military said on Thursday an investigation into the incident was still underway. ""The Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) officials have confirmed that at this point in the investigation into the death of Pte Ana Basalduaruiz no foul play is evident, and will remain under investigation,"" officials said. ""Army CID will continue to conduct a thorough investigation and gather all evidence and facts to ensure they discover exactly what transpired.""Pte Basaldua Ruiz - who was from Long Beach, California - had served with the 1st Cavalry Division for the past 15 months, Fort Hood officials said. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of PV2 Ana Basalduaruiz, and we extend our sympathies to her father, mother, and her sister,"" Lt Col Patrick Sullivan, a commander of the 91st Engineer Battalion, said in a statement. Pte Basaldua Ruiz´s mother, Alejandra Ruiz Zarco, who lives in Michoacán, Mexico, where she raised her daughter, told Noticias Telemundo that her daughter had said her superior was harassing her and that she was receiving constant sexual advances from other people at the base.Her father, Baldo Basaldua, said his daughter told him shortly before her death that ""her whole life was going wrong and that she wanted to die"". Army officials have been providing inconsistent answers to Pte Basaldua Ruiz´s family about her death, said Stephanie Gattas, a spokesperson for the family who founded the Pink Berets, a Texas non-profit that works with women in the military struggling with trauma.""They´re not getting what they´re asking for in terms of information,"" she said. ""We´re trying to get to the root of the truth.""The Texas base has came under fire for a series of deaths there, including the case of 20-year-old Vanessa Guillén, who was killed at Fort Hood in 2020. Her family alleged she was sexually harassed by a supervisor before she was killed. US Army leaders fired over abuse of women soldiersSuspect in US missing soldier case took own lifeAuthorities allege a soldier, Army Specialist Aaron Robinson, killed Guillén and fatally shot himself as officials were close to arresting him. Cecily Aguilar, who authorities said was Robinson´s girlfriend, also pleaded guilty last November for helping him dispose of Guillén´s body. An investigation was launched into the US Army base after Guillén´s death, which led to more than a dozen leaders being relieved of duty.

'They call us garbage people': The Syrians surviving off US army waste - BBC News,"Related TopicsSyrian civil warImage source, Gabriel ChaimImage caption, It is no life for any child scavenging in a rubbish dumpBy Lina ShaikhouniBBC World ServiceAmid piles of waste, and surrounded by toxic fumes from burning rubbish, a small group of people hunt for food to eat and plastic to sell for recycling. This is not the life Alia wanted for her children.  For the past three years, she has set off at 07:00 every day on a two-hour journey to the dump in Tell Beydar, north-east Syria, often taking Walaa with her. Alia´s eldest daughter, born when Alia was barely in her teens, stays at home to take care of a younger child. Alia and Walaa do not return until sundown. By this time, the family is starving.  ""I have always dreamt that my daughters would study like other girls,"" Alia says. ""But now they are like me, they don´t know how to read or write at all.""The US military dump, though, is their only source of food and income.""People shame us; they call us garbage people,"" says 25-year-old Alia. Image source, Gabriel ChaimImage caption, Walaa is weighed down by rubbishAfter more than a decade of war, an estimated 15.3 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, the latest UN figures show. And four in five people out of this total do not have access to sufficient food. Alia´s daughter Walaa is one of them.  ""We´re here to find meat, to find food because we´re hungry,"" says the 12-year-old.In the Kurdish-controlled north-east, the war against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has devastated the local economy.Alia´s husband was a farm labourer. But when he died 10 years ago, the family unit collapsed. A raging war, worsening drought and dire economic conditions have made her desperate. A truck arrives at the dump and the children rush forward. Rummaging through piles of black rubbish bags, 15-year-old Amer finds leftover pieces of chicken. He sucks on the bones and hunts for more. ""If there were other jobs, I would have worked elsewhere. But there´s nothing else for me to do,"" he says. Image source, Gabriel ChaimImage caption, Children can walk for up to two hours to reach this dumpAmer is the only breadwinner in his family of 11. He earns between 3,000 and 5,000 Syrian pounds (roughly $1-2; £0.80-1.60) a day from selling the plastic he finds. It´s barely enough to survive. ""Things got hard after the war. We can´t even afford bread,"" he says. Amer´s brother fought alongside American forces against IS in the region. He was recently injured on patrol and barely makes enough money to provide for his family.""The Americans should do more to help us,"" adds Amer.   The fight against ISIn 2015, the US deployed troops in Syria to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance in their fight against IS. Four years later, they declared victory over the jihadist group in Syria.  The area is now governed by a Kurdish-led multi-ethnic administration, but life is far from normal. ""What is happening in the north-east is a natural outcome of the deteriorating conditions in the country,"" says the head of a non-governmental organisation working on development projects in the region, who wishes to remain anonymous for security reasons. The north-east´s vast agricultural lands and oil fields were once a main source of income for Syria. Now, skyrocketing food prices, rising security threats, and a doubling in population caused by the arrival of hundreds of thousands of displaced people have increased poverty rates. Many people are now reliant on humanitarian aid to survive, but scarce funding and logistical constraints mean aid is not reaching everyone in need.   Image source, Gabriel ChaimImage caption, Walaa sifts through piles of rubbishThe UN has been struggling to get aid into the area, especially after Russia and China blocked a UN resolution authorising continued deliveries via an Iraqi border crossing in 2020. That meant people living in the north-east had to start relying on shipments via Syrian government-controlled territory.Even the aid that does arrive is mostly sent to camps for displaced people and areas most affected by the war, such as Raqqa and Deir al-Zour, the head of the NGO explains. Rural areas in between, such as the villages around Tell Baydar and others, are overlooked. Journalist Hamza Hamki, from the city of Qamishli, says ""dumpster diving"" is not widespread across the north-east but that the number of people resorting to it has increased.  ""People need development projects. They need reconstruction. But these projects don´t exist, which contributes to rising poverty rates.""Constant security threats hinder any plans to fund such projects. Turkey launched in 2019 a military offensive to drive out SDF forces from a stretch of territory along the Syrian border west of Tell Baydar, and it has said recently that it is planning another such operation.The SDF is dominated by the Kurdish People´s Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara lists as a terrorist organisation. It sees the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers´ Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades, and says the militia´s presence in border areas constitutes a security threat. There is also the risk of an IS resurgence. Image source, Gabriel ChaimImage caption, A US surveillance blimp hovers overhead as Walaa rummages through the dumpThe presence of about 900 US troops in Syria offers protection against these threats. But it is not yet clear how long the US bases there will remain operational.""If the US pulls out, it will take no more than 24 hours for the entire region to fall to either Turkey or the Syrian government,"" says Mr Hamki, adding that both scenarios would have ""catastrophic"" implications on people in the area. ""People do not have issues with any side. People just want to live with dignity,"" he says.Children like Amer and Walaa have spent their whole life knowing nothing but war and desperation. ""I wish we had a bit more money so I could go to school and work [somewhere else]. That´s all I wish for,"" says Amer.Related TopicsPovertySyrian civil warExtreme PovertyKurdsSyria",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64400345,31,01,2023,bbc,usa
Drugs giant Eli Lilly caps monthly insulin costs in US at $35 - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eli Lilly will cut prices for popular insulins by 70%Drug giant Eli Lilly has announced a $35 (£30) cap on the monthly costs patients face for insulin in the US, responding to outcry over the soaring cost of the diabetes medication. More than eight million Americans use insulin to control their diabetes, the American Diabetes Association says. Last year, the US passed a law capping monthly costs at $35 for people with certain government health insurance. But for many people with private insurance the costs remain much higher. Eli Lilly said it would institute the cap on out-of-pocket costs for Lilly insulin users immediately as it prepares to cut the list price of two of its most commonly prescribed insulins, Humalog and Humalin, by 70% by the end of the year. It is also dropping the list price of its non-branded insulin, Lispro, to $25 a vial, effective 1 May.""While the current healthcare system provides access to insulin for most people with diabetes, it still does not provide affordable insulin for everyone and that needs to change,"" said David A Ricks, Lilly´s Chair and CEO.  ""The aggressive price cuts we´re announcing today should make a real difference.""President Joe Biden said Lilly´s announcement was ""huge news"".He has called for a national $35 cap on monthly insulin costs, a proposal that was defeated in Congress last year. ""Last year, we capped insulin prices for seniors on Medicare, but there was more work to do,"" he said in a statement. ""Today, Eli Lilly is heeding my call. Others should follow.""While Lilly is a major player in the market, the company estimates that a majority of patients use drugs from other companies. Many face costs that can be hundreds of dollars a month or more - far higher than the norm in many other countries. The list price - what a person without health insurance would have to pay - for a vial of Lilly´s Humalog is currently about $275. Because insurance companies negotiate medicine prices, many patients with insurance face lower costs.Ravi Lulla of Omaha, Nebraska did not take certain jobs - even if he really wanted to - because he needed to work for a company with good insurance that would help him access affordable insulin. The 35-year-old told the BBC he had to leave his previous job after they changed insurance plans and his insulin rose from $30  to $300 per month.When making career decisions, he said he always thought: ""How does this affect my ability to have affordable access to insulin?""He said news of the cap gives him some sense of security around the medication he uses to manage type 1 diabetes. ""If I get laid off or decide to pursue a career I enjoy instead of one that pays for my insulin my life isn´t in danger,"" he said.  Overall, Lilly estimates that the average out-of-pocket cost for Lilly insulins has dropped to $21.80 over the last five years.Lilly said people can access the new savings on out-of-pocket costs via their pharmacy or with a card from Lilly´s Insulin Value Program.""We are driving for change in re-pricing older insulins, but we know that seven out of 10 Americans don´t use Lilly insulin,"" Mr Ricks of Lilly said. ""We are calling on policymakers, employers and others to join us in making insulin more affordable.""Insulin costs in the US are much higher than in other countries. For example, a 2020 Rand study found that the average price per vial of insulin in the US was more than $98 in 2018, compared with less than $7 in Australia, $12 in Canada and less than $8 in the UK. Even after insurance discounts were taken into account, patients likely faced costs roughly four times the average elsewhere, it found.

Man arrested after explosive found in luggage at US airport - BBC News,"Image source, ReutersImage caption, The suspect was seen on airport cameras leaving the airportBy Max MatzaBBC NewsFBI agents have arrested a man who allegedly brought an explosive device to a Pennsylvania airport on Monday. Mark Muffley, 40, is accused of putting the device in his checked bag for a flight to Orlando, Florida. He fled the airport after his name was called over the loud speaker, agents say, and was arrested at home later that evening. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials say they spotted the device during a routine screening. Officials say Mr Muffley checked in for Allegiant Air Flight 201 at Lehigh Valley International Airport, 65 miles (105km) north of Philadelphia, on Monday morning. About an hour later, TSA screeners discovered the suspicious item and called FBI specialists, including a bomb technician, to examine the device. Image source, ReutersIn charging documents, FBI bomb technician Jared Witmier said a 3 inch (7.5cm) device hidden in the lining of the suspect´s rolling suitcase was found to contain fuses and explosive powder. There was a quick fuse, which appeared to be a part of the original manufacture of the compound, and a hobby fuse, which seemed to have been added post-manufacture, according to the criminal complaint.The ""powder is suspected to be a mixture of flash powder and the dark granulars that are used in commercial grade fireworks"", the FBI court document says. ""The black powder and flash powder are susceptible to ignite from heat and friction and posed a significant risk to the aircraft and passengers.""The bag also contained ""a can of butane, a lighter, a pipe with white powder residue, a wireless drill with cordless batteries"" and two circuit breakers that were taped together. Five minutes after he was paged over the airport loud speaker, Mr Muffley was seen by security cameras leaving the airport, the court papers say.

"How tanks from Germany, US and UK could change the Ukraine war - BBC News","Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, EPAImage caption, US M1 Abrams are faster than most Russian-made tanksBy Jonathan BealeDefence correspondentIs this the week when the war dramatically turned in Ukraine´s favour? It was certainly a decisive moment, with a coalition of Western nations confirming they were finally willing to supply modern-made main battle tanks. Germany said it would send Leopard 2 tanks and the US said it would send M1 Abrams tanks. Both the UK and Poland have already made concrete pledges, and other nations are expected to follow. Some commentators have described the move as a potential ""gamechanger"". But is it really enough to win the war? Ben Barry, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (ISS), tells the BBC that Western tanks will make a difference. But the former British Army Brigadier also warns that the pledges made so far are unlikely to prove decisive. In modern warfare, tanks have been a key element for offensive operations - to punch through enemy lines and retake territory. Used effectively, they provide mobile firepower, protection, shock and surprise. Concentrated in numbers, they can dislocate an enemy´s defences. But they also need the support of artillery to first weaken those defences and then the support of infantry to hold retaken ground.History shows tanks alone don´t win battles. The British first used hundreds of tanks at the battle of Cambrai in November 1917 - to end the deadlock of static trench warfare. Initially they made significant advances, but many tanks soon broke down and a German counter offensive turned British gains into losses.Tanks can also be used in defence. In 1940 they were used by the retreating British and French armies at Arras to stall the Nazi invasion, allowing the subsequent evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk. But Ukraine has made clear that it wants weapons not just to stall any potential Russian spring offensive, but to retake its own territory - to go on the attack.How Ukraine might use tanks as attack spearheadsIt would make little sense for Ukraine to disperse its additional tanks across a frontline of more than 1,000km (621 miles). To break through Russian defences, Ukraine will need to concentrate its forces - possibly over an area of between five and 20km (between three and 12 miles). Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former colonel in the British Army´s Royal Tank Regiment, says numbers do matter for a breakthrough. An armoured brigade for a significant offensive operation would normally include at least 70 tanks. So more than 100 Western battle tanks could make a big difference, he says.If Ukraine had more it could try to conduct simultaneous offensive operations in different places, as it did last year in the north and the south. Germany confirms it will send tanks to UkraineLeopard 2 tanks: Why Germany delayed sending themgThen there´s the additional support required for what the military call ""combined arms manoeuvre"". The UK is not just sending Ukraine 14 Challenger tanks, but also 30 artillery self-propelled guns and armoured vehicles to carry and protect troops. That new package of military support also includes mine breaching and bridge-laying vehicles. In other words, the essential elements needed for any offensive operation.The US is also providing Ukraine with more than 100 Bradley and Stryker armoured vehicles, and Germany 40 of its Marder infantry fighting vehicle - as well as tanks.Tanks are the tip of the spear, designed to move quickly over open ground. The Challenger 2, Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams are faster than most Russian-made tanks with speeds of more than 25mph (40km per hour) on rough terrain. To take ground quickly, with any element of surprise, they would likely avoid urban areas where they would be more vulnerable to attack. Russia showed early on in this war, in its failed attempt to surround Kyiv, that a long column of armour on a road is an easy target. Mr Barry, of ISS, says any spearhead attack would look for an enemy´s weak points. But he also warns that Russia has spent the last few months reinforcing defensive positions with trenches and tank traps. Western tanks are also about 20 tonnes heavier than their Russian counterparts. The additional armour gives better protection but it also means the tanks may be too heavy to cross some makeshift bridges. Russia and Ukraine have both blown bridges to slow down advances.Surprise attacks at nightMr de Bretton Gordon, who commanded a squadron of British Challenger tanks, says one of the big advantages of Western-made tanks is their ability to fight at night.Night sights and thermal imaging camera are standard. Only Russia´s more advanced tanks - like the T-90 - are fitted to fight at night. Attacks under the cover of darkness also add to the element of shock and surprise.The greatest challenge for Ukraine will be logistics - maintaining the flow of fuel, ammunition and spare parts. Ukraine is not just having to maintain its old Soviet-era arsenal, it is also having to worry about an increasingly complex inventory of Western supplied weapons. Ukraine weapons: what equipment is the world giving?Britain´s Challenger 2 tanks, for instance, do not use the same Nato standard ammunition as the Leopard and Abrams. The Challenger 2 is no longer in production and even the British Army has had to cannibalise some spare parts from its existing fleet. Mr Barry says Ukrainian engineers may be familiar with repairing diesel engines - like those in the Leopard and Challenger. But he says the US-made Abrams runs on a more complicated gas turbine engine. It also consumes about twice the amount of fuel as a German-made Leopard. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Germany produces the vast majority of modern heavy tanks in Europe - the Leopard 2sIf Western pledges are firmed, Ukraine´s armed forces could be boosted by more than 100 tanks. That would still fall well short of what Ukraine´s overall military commander asked for. Last October, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Ukraine needed an additional 300 tanks, 700 infantry fighting vehicles and 500 howitzers for his planned offensive this year. It might end up with just half of that. The training required on the weapons will take time too - weeks if not months. And it´s still not clear when all this equipment will arrive. The US has indicated that its 31 M1 Abrams tanks might not be ready for months. Ukraine is also waiting for the West to respond to its repeated request for modern warplanes. An army attacking on the ground will need protection from the air. Western officials had hoped that Ukraine may be able to mount an offensive as soon as this spring. They believe there is now a window of opportunity while Russia struggles to recruit and rebuild its battered forces, and to replenish its dwindling supplies of ammunition. Ukraine has managed to prove the doubters wrong in the past - but it will still need more Western support if it is to achieve its goal of expelling Russian forces.

US arrests two for illegally exporting aviation tech to Russia - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The two men were operating a trading company in RussiaTwo men in the US state of Kansas have been arrested on suspicion of illegally sending aviation technology to Russia. Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, 59, and Douglas Robertson, 55, owned and operated the KanRus Trading Company.The two conspired to skirt US export laws to sell sophisticated aviation equipment to Russia, says the US Department of Justice. If convicted, they face a maximum of 20 years in prison for exporting controlled goods without a licence. They are also charged with conspiracy, falsifying and failing to file electronic export information, and smuggling goods contrary to US law.Prosecutors said the two had since 2020 sought to evade US export laws, misstating the value and end destination of shipments by routing them through third-party countries.Between November 2020 and February 2021, they received avionics equipment for repair in the US, according to the justice department, including a computer processor with a sticker for Russia´s secretive security agency.Mr Buyanovsky and Mr Robertson used a fraudulent invoice to identify the destination for the equipment as Germany, says the justice department. The defendants also illegally sent avionics gear through Armenia and Cyprus to Russia without obtaining the proper licences, it is alleged.The investigation was carried out by a justice department unit dedicated to enforcing sanctions imposed on the Russian government since its invasion of Ukraine.

The Last of Us: Could a fungal pandemic turn us all into zombies? - BBC News,"Image source, HBO/Warner Media/Liane HentscherImage caption, A scene from HBO´s post-apocalyptic TV drama The Last of Us showing a body consumed by Cordyceps fungiBy James GallagherInside Health presenter, BBC Radio 4Let me introduce you to something truly horrifying - the fungus that turns its victims into zombies. Its spores enter the body. The fungus then grows and begins to hijack the mind of its host until it loses control and is compelled to climb to higher ground. The parasitic fungus devours its victim from the inside, extracting every last nutrient, as it prepares for its big finale.Then - in a scene more disturbing than the scariest horror film - a tendril of death erupts from the head. This fruiting body of the fungus showers spores on everything around it - dooming others to the same zombie fate. It sounds like a work of fiction. But the kingdom of fungi - distinct from plants and animals - ranges from edible mushrooms to nightmare-fuel parasites.Species of parasitic Cordyceps and Ophiocordyceps fungi are very real. Here, on the BBC´s Planet Earth series, Sir David Attenborough watches as one takes control of an ant:Figure caption, Warning: Third party content may contain advertsThat clip of zombie ants inspired ""The Last of Us"" - possibly the best video game I´ve ever played, and now a hit TV series which follows the same plot. In both the game and on TV, Cordyceps makes the leap from preying on its usual insect victims, to infecting humans. The resulting pandemic leads to the collapse of society.The Last of Us: TV series of hit game praised by criticsFungi are ´underloved and understudied´But in the real world, is a Cordyceps pandemic - or one caused by another fungus - ever likely to happen?  ""I think we underestimate fungal infections at our peril,"" Dr Neil Stone, leading fungal expert at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, tells me.""We´ve already done that for too long and we are completely unprepared for dealing with a fungal pandemic.""At the end of October last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first list of life-threatening fungi. There are some nasty bugs on there, but you´ll be relieved to know that zombifying-Cordyceps do not feature.Why not?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A caterpillar consumed by a parasitic fungus - with its spore-releasing tendrilsDr Charissa de Bekker, a microbiologist at Utrecht University, has studied how Cordyceps creates zombified ants and says she cannot see the same ever happening in people.""Our body temperature is simply too high for most fungi to nicely settle and grow - and this is the same for this Cordyceps.""Their nervous system is simpler than ours, so it would definitely be easier to hijack the brain of an insect versus our brain, also their immune systems are very different from ours.""Most species of parasitic Cordyceps have evolved over millions of years to specialise in infecting just one insect species. Most do not jump from one insect to another. ""For this fungus to be able to jump from an insect to us and cause an infection is a very big leap,"" says Dr de Bekker.Listen to James on the Inside Health podcast: Is a fungal pandemic possible?The threats posed by fungi have been dismissed for a long time. ""People think of it as something trivial, superficial or unimportant,"" says Dr Stone.Only a handful of the millions of species of fungi cause disease, but some of them can be so much worse than an irritating bout of Athlete´s foot or an infected toenail.Fungi kill around 1.7 million people a year - that´s about three times as many as malaria. Deadly threats bigger than CordycepsThe WHO has identified 19 different fungi it thinks are a significant worry. These include the sudden emergence of a deadly superbug, Candida auris - and a fungi, Mucormycetes, that eats our flesh so quickly that it leads to severe facial injuries. Dr Neil Stone invites me to Health Services Laboratory (HSL) in London, where samples from UK patients are analysed to see if their infections are caused by a fungus and what treatments may work. We discuss some of the biggest fungal dangers. Image source, James GallagherImage caption, Dr Neil Stone says we ignore the fungus, Candida auris, ""at our peril""Candida auris is the first we look at. It´s a yeast-type fungus and you get that strong waft of a brewery, or bread dough, when you are near it. But if it gets inside the body, it can invade the blood, nervous system and internal organs. The WHO estimates up to half of people die if they have an invasive infection of Candida auris.""It´s like a monster which has appeared in the last 15 years or so, but it´s now being found all over the world,"" says Dr Stone. The first documented case was in the ear of a patient at Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital in 2009. Candida auris naturally shrugs off anti-fungal drugs and some strains are resistant to all of the medicines we have. That´s why it´s considered a superbug. Transmission is mainly through contaminated surfaces in hospitals. It sticks to intravenous lines and blood pressure cuffs. It´s really hard to clean off. The solution is often to close entire wards. This has happened even in the UK.Dr Stone says it is the ""most worrying"" fungi and we ""ignore it at our peril"" as, if it takes off, ""it could shut down entire healthcare systems"".Another killer fungus - Cryptococcus neoformans - is able to get into people´s nervous systems and cause devastating meningitis. Sid and Ellie were only in the first days of their honeymoon in Costa Rica when Ellie started to feel ill.Image source, Sid and EllieImage caption, Sid and Ellie celebrating their wedding before Ellie caught a fungal infectionHer initial symptoms - headaches and nausea - were put down to too much sun, but then she started jerking and developed full-blown seizures. She had to be bundled up in a hammock and taken in a boat to get medical help.""I´ve never seen something more horrifying and especially feeling so helpless,"" Sid tells me. Scans showed swelling on her brain and tests identified Cryptococcus. Fortunately, Ellie responded to treatment. She came out of a coma after 12 days on a ventilator. ""I just remember screaming,"" she says. She had delusions - including of having triplets, and that her husband had gambled their money away. ""So the first thing I said to him was it´s over,"" she says.Now, Ellie is recovering well. She says she ""never"" thought a fungus could do such a thing to a person. ""You don´t think you´re going to go on your honeymoon and almost die.""Mucormycetes also known as black fungus, causes the flesh-eating disease mucormycosis. It has a nickname that reveals its insidious nature - the lid lifter. Image source, James GallagherImage caption, Mucormycetes fungi can grow incredibly rapidlyIt takes off so quickly. This image shows that, after just 24 hours growing in a petri dish, it can lift the lid off.""When you have a piece of fruit and the next day it´s turned to mush, that´s because it has had a mucor-fungus [Mucormycetes] inside of it,"" says Dr Rebecca Gorton, a clinical scientist at HSL. She says it´s rare in humans, but can be a ""really serious infection"". Black fungus is an opportunist that takes hold in people with weak immune systems. It assaults the face, eyes, and brain and can be fatal or leave people severely disfigured. A bad infection ""grows as quickly"" in the body as it does in fruit or the lab, warns Dr Gorton.During the Covid pandemic, there was an explosion of black fungus cases in India. More than 4,000 people died. Steroids being taken for Covid, which weakened immune systems, and high levels of diabetes, are thought to have aided the fungus´s proliferation.  India records more than 4,300 ´black fungus´ deathsShould we take fungi more seriously?Fungi are very different types of infection to bacteria or viruses. When a fungus makes us ill, it is nearly always picked up from the environment rather than spread through coughs and sneezes. We are all regularly exposed to fungi, but they often need a weakened immune system in order to take off. As medicine keeps more of us alive - such as surviving some cancer treatments - there are more of us with weaker immune systems. Dr Stone says a fungal pandemic would probably take ""a different form"" to Covid - in both how it spreads and the type of people it infects.He thinks the threat is there because of ""the pure volume of fungi in the environment... climate change, international travel, increasing number of cases and their deep neglect in terms of treatments we have"".Fungi might not turn us all into zombies, but they can cause far more problems than a bit of Athlete´s foot.

What chicken feet tell us about daily life in Egypt - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage caption, Food prices in Egypt have tripled in recent months making basic staples unaffordableBy Yolande KnellBBC News""Oh God, don´t let us get to the point of having to eat chicken feet,"" says a man begging alongside the poultry sellers in Giza market. Egypt is facing a deepening economic crisis, a situation so acute its people are struggling to feed their families. The latest nutritional advice from the state suggested cooking up some chicken feet - a protein-rich part of the bird usually reserved as scraps for dogs and cats. This recommendation has sparked anger and intensified criticism of the government.Many countries are battling soaring inflation but running at just over 30% in March, Egypt is one of those suffering the most. For many people, items that were previously basic staples such as cooking oil and cheese have become unaffordable luxuries. Some products have doubled or tripled in price within months.""I eat meat once a month, or I don´t buy it at all. I buy chicken once a week,"" says Wedad, a mother-of-three in her sixties, as she picks her way through the stalls. ""Nowadays, even one egg is sold for LE5 [US $0.16; £0.13].""Part of the reason Egypt is struggling is it relies very heavily on imported food rather than domestic agriculture to feed its huge population of over 100 million people. Even the grain to feed its chickens is shipped in.Over 12 months last year the Egyptian pound lost half its value versus the US dollar. So in January, when the government devalued the currency again, this pushed the cost of imports like grain sharply higher. Image caption, With many families no longer able to afford products like beef the government has advised they eat chicken feetA year ago, Wedad lived comfortably on her monthly pension of LE5,000. She would have described herself as middle-class. Now, like many other Egyptians, she struggles to make ends meet. Today, she has scraped together just enough money to buy some chicken.""One seller told me the price for a kilo of chicken fillets was LE160. Others say 175, 190, even 200,"" says Wedad, as she shops around. ""Chicken legs are LE90, but even chicken bones are sold now - and the feet cost just 20,"" she adds with a sarcastic laugh.President Adbdul Fattah al-Sisi often blames the turmoil which followed the 2011 Egyptian uprising and rapid population growth for his country´s current economic woes. He also points to the pandemic followed by the war in Ukraine.The Russian invasion of Ukraine in March last year dealt a serious blow to the economy. Egypt is the world´s second biggest importer of wheat, and the two countries were its primary suppliers. When the war disrupted exports, the price of wheat - and consequently bread - soared.Russian and Ukrainian holidaymakers used to visit Egypt in droves so the tourist sector also lost money.  Tourism, which used to generate about 5% of gross domestic product (GDP), had already been hit hard by the pandemic. Image caption, Egypt was a major wheat importer from Ukraine and Russia before Russia´s invasion disrupted shipmentsAnalysts suggest missteps from the government have made a bad situation far worse. The power and influence of the presidency, military, security and intelligence agencies has grown while President Sisi has been in charge, according to Timothy Kaldas, a political economist at think tank The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.Mr Kaldas says this has happened through expansion of regime-owned enterprises, with the military for example, given state contracts for huge infrastructure projects.Private sector involvement has shrunk dramatically as a result - with companies not affiliated to the regime unable to compete. Many foreign investors have deserted Egypt.Egypt´s struggles have sent it to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ask for a bailout four times in the past six years. Almost half of the state´s revenue goes towards paying back these debts, which amount to 90% of GDP.Image caption, Anger is rising as the government is accused of mishandling the economic crisisGulf countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have bought state assets and are helping to prop up Egypt, but have also tightened their conditions for further investments.Both the West and Gulf neighbours fear the fallout if the most populous country in the Middle East were allowed to fail.Past economic hardship led to riots and contributed to the fall of both former presidents Hosni Mubarak and Mohammed Morsi. And there are already signs that growing public anger over the economy will cause unrest again.""I can´t tell you how we women regret the black day that we went to vote for you,"" one Egyptian housewife tells President Sisi in a social media video that went viral. ""You´ve made our life hell.""She counts some small change out from her purse, asking with how she is supposed to feed her children with that.Image caption, With the holy month of Ramadan starting on March 23 many worry they won´t be able to have the traditional feastMeanwhile, back at her apartment, Wedad is trimming green beans and chopping tomatoes to prepare fasouliya khadra, a traditional dish for her grandchildren.  Her mind turns to the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. It may involve dawn-to-dusk fasting, but typically there are also generous feasts. ""What will I do this year?"" Wedad asks, shaking her head. She imagines even chicken will soon be off the menu. ""I can barely afford lentil soup.""Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warEgyptAbdul Fattah al-SisiCost of living",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64951519,19,03,2023,bbc,usa
Ukraine: US and European countries pledge heavy weapons - BBC News,"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, French-made Caesar artillery is already being used by Ukrainian troopsBy James GregoryBBC NewsMore countries have answered President Volodymyr Zelensky´s call to send further arms to Ukraine. The US says a package worth $2.5bn (£2bn) will be sent, including armoured vehicles and air defence systems.Several European nations promised their own new packages - including hundreds of missiles pledged to Kyiv by the UK.The announcements come ahead of a crunch meeting scheduled in Germany on Friday, in which 50 countries are set to co-ordinate arms supplies.A meeting on Thursday saw representatives from 11 nations gather at an army base in Estonia to discuss a range of new packages to help Ukraine recapture territory and fend off any further Russian advances.Nine countries - the UK, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Czech Republic, Estonia, the Netherlands and Slovakia - promised more support.The packages announced in a joint statement include:UK - 600 Brimstone missilesDenmark - 19 French-made Caesar self-propelled howitzersEstonia - howitzers, ammunition, support vehicles and anti-tank grenade launchersLatvia - Stinger air-defence systems, two helicopters, and dronesLithuania - anti-aircraft guns and two helicoptersPoland - S-60 anti-aircraft guns with 70,000 pieces of ammunitionCzech Republic - produce further large calibre ammunition, howitzers and APCsThe Netherlands will announce its package of support on Friday.Speaking during his visit to Estonia, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ""In 2023, it is time to turn the momentum that the Ukrainians have achieved in pushing back Russia into gains and... push them back out of Ukraine and to restore Ukraine´s sovereignty, which is their right under international law.""The announcement of fresh US support arrived later on Thursday. Despite Ukrainian hopes, it did not contain an offer of tanks.But the Pentagon did promise Kyiv an extra 59 Bradley armoured vehicles, 90 Stryker personnel carriers and Avenger air defence systems, among other large and small munitions. It said recent air attacks demonstrated ""the devastating impact of Russia´s brutal war in Ukraine"" - but said the newly-pledged arms would help to fend these off.A statement added that the US had now committed more than $26.7bn in security assistance to Ukraine since Moscow´s full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Ben Wallace and his counterparts in EstoniaA meeting of the Ukraine Defence Group, made up of key allies including the US, will convene at Ramstein air base in Germany on Friday to discuss further military support. President Zelensky said he expected ""strong decisions"" on further arms exports to be made at that meeting, including a ""powerful military support package"" from the US. The talks are likely to focus on the question of whether to send heavy tanks, and crucially who will supply them. Despite the billions of dollars pledged in new weapons by Western allies on Thursday, this question remains unanswered.Ukraine is asking for German-made Leopard tanks to be sent to the front line. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is coming under increasing international and domestic pressure to supply them, or at least approve their delivery by third countries. Poland and Finland have both promised to send their Leopards - but need Germany´s permission, as the manufacturing country, to do so.

Anti-slavery: Welsh abolitionist Robert Everett recognised in USA - BBC News,"Image source, Bangor University Image caption, Born in Flintshire in 1791, Reverend Robert Everett emigrated to the US from Denbighshire in 1823, and became a leader of the Welsh-speaking abolitionist movementA Welshman has been recognised for his work trying to abolish slavery in the USA in the 19th Century.Reverend Robert Everett emigrated to the US from Denbighshire in 1823, and became a leader of the Welsh-speaking abolitionist movement.His work involved translating works into Welsh and helping people flee from slavery.Mr Everett will be inducted into the American National Abolition Hall of Fame for his anti-slavery work.He will join the likes of Harriet Tubman following his induction on Saturday and Sunday.Black history to be mandatory in Welsh schoolsWhat does it mean to be Welsh?  Born in Llanasa, Flintshire, in 1791, Mr Everett was ordained a congregational minister and appointed to Swan Lane Chapel in Denbigh in 1815. He emigrated to America in 1823 to minister at a Welsh congregational church in Utica, New York state, which was then considered the unofficial capital of Welsh-American communities.In 1838, he took charge of two Welsh chapels - Capel Ucha and Capel Penmynydd in the villages of Steuben and Remsen, near Utica. ""He probably did more than anybody else to radicalise Welsh-speaking Americans and enlist them in the anti-slavery movement,"" said Prof Jerry Hunter.The American academic, who now works at Bangor University, came across Mr Everett´s work through his research into Welsh writing in the US.At the time, he said America had many vibrant Welsh-speaking communities, which supported a Welsh language publishing industry.Image source, Google MapsImage caption, The American National Abolition Hall of Fame Museum, in Peterboro, New York state, honours abolitionists, their work to end slavery and the legacy of that struggleMr Everett pushed the abolition of slavery to the forefront of these newspaper and magazine editions. As the editor of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), he printed anti-slavery material and a 10-point campaign plan to enlist Welsh Americans to the cause.But abolition was not the only issue on the campaigner´s mind: women´s rights, pacifism and temperance were also on his agenda, according to Prof Hunter.Family leave Wales after girl faces racism at schoolAnti-racism training to be given in schoolsMr Everett´s papers also revealed he was involved in translating abolitionist works into Welsh and that he assisted fleeing slaves.His political preaching was not welcomed by everyone, but Prof Hunter argued his radicalism was an intrinsic part of how he defined non-conformist religion.Ted Engle, an American of Welsh descent and one of the group who proposed the nomination, said he was ""embarrassed"" by the fact he ""really didn´t know how influential Everett was"".""Much has been forgotten even in our area with deep Welsh roots and it seemed unthinkable that we were not more knowledgeable.""

Ovidio Guzmán: US asks Mexico to extradite El Chapo's son - BBC News,"Image source, US State DepartmentImage caption, The US had offered a $5m-reward for information leading to the capture of Ovidio GuzmánBy Vanessa BuschschlüterBBC NewsThe United States has asked Mexico to extradite a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, Mexican officials say.Ovidio Guzmán was arrested on 5 January in Sinaloa state, in northern Mexico.The 32-year-old is suspected of leading, along with his brother, the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel which his father founded.Ovidio Guzmán is also accused of having ordered the murder of a singer who had refused to perform at his wedding.Their father was tried in a US court and is serving a life sentence in a maximum-security jail in Colorado after having been found guilty of leading the Sinaloa cartel.Ovidio is one of four children El Chapo had during his relationship with Griselda López in the 1980s and 90s. The oldest of them, Edgar, was killed in a cartel shootout in 2008.El Chapo also has other children from his previous marriage and from his subsequent relationship with Emma Coronel, who is also in jail in the US.Ovidio´s older brother, called Joaquín after his father, is still on the run. Both brothers have been indicted by a US court on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.Sources in the Mexican government told local media that the US had officially requested that Ovidio Guzmán be extradited to stand trial in the US. After a six-month surveillance operation, law enforcement officials swooped down on the house outside the city of Culiacán where Ovidio Guzmán, also known as ""El Ratón"" (The Mouse), was hiding.Twenty-nine people died in the firefight which ensued and members of his cartel burned buses and cars to block access roads to prevent police reinforcements from reaching the city.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Buses burn and block roads on the streets of Culiacan, MexicoOvidio Guzmán was flown to Mexico City in a helicopter for fear that if he was transported by road his hitmen would try to attack the convoy.It was not the first time the alleged cartel leader´s arrest led to violence. In June 2020, the security forces briefly detained Ovidio Guzmán but were ordered by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to release him ""so as not to put the population at risk"" as Sinaloa gunmen torched buses and engaged in gun battles with police and soldiers.He had been in hiding for the following 18 months before his re-arrest in January 2023.

Iran vs USA is no different. It´s set against the backdrop of mass protests in Iran since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini two months ago - who was detained by the country´s police for incorrectly wearing her headscarf.And it means there´s mixed feelings among Iranians in the UK about supporting their home team. ´Doesn´t represent me or my values´Image source, MahrouMahrou, 17 came to the UK from Iran in 2018 but says she won´t be feeling the same kind of pride as other fans. ""I´m not supporting Iran,"" she says.""I don´t feel like I can because the Islamic regime has hijacked our football team to use this as a mechanism to show nothing is wrong in Iran. ""It doesn´t represent me or my values or my culture. ""There´s a feeling deep inside of me that doesn´t want them to win. It´s my country and where I get my name from but I can´t support them. ""When you´re standing and representing a regime instead of your own people, it makes you really think. ""Football is a huge part of Iranian culture.

""All Iranians are facing a dilemma tonight about how to feel. Progressing in the World Cup means we keep the conversation going about what´s happening but also it´s a chance for the Iranian government to keep their propaganda going.""Not singing the anthem in their first match was important - the players should try and show solidarity with what´s happening in ways like that as much as they can. ""Even being in the UK, we can be scared about speaking out against the Iranian government because of our families back home."" It´s been over 20 years since Iran and the USA came head to head at a World Cup and the political tensions run just as deep. Ahead of this match, Iran´s football federation has complained to FIFA about the US using a modified Iranian flag in social media posts.It was missing the Islamic script and emblem which were added in 1980.

Guo Wengui: US accuses Chinese tycoon of billion-dollar fraud - BBC News,"Image source, TwitterMike WendlingBBC NewsUS authorities have charged a Chinese property tycoon based in New York with orchestrating a billion-dollar fraud.Guo Wengui and one of his business partners, Kin Ming Je, are accused of wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud and money laundering.Mr Guo is a critic of the Chinese government and an associate of ex-White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon.A fire broke out at Mr Guo´s Manhattan penthouse apartment hours after he was arrested. A spokesman for the city´s fire department said the fire was put out, no injuries were reported and the cause is still under investigation.  In an online post earlier, Mr Guo said he was handcuffed and interrogated for more than an hour. He later pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan federal court on Wednesday and was ordered to be detained without bail.Mr Guo goes by several aliases including Miles Guo, Miles Kwok and ""Brother Seven"". He was named in the indictment unsealed Wednesday as Ho Wan Kwok. The indictment alleges that Mr Guo and Mr Je raised $1bn (£830m) from thousands of online followers who thought they were funding media businesses and an exclusive membership club. They also allegedly used a cryptocurrency called Himalaya Coin to steal millions from investors.Mr Guo´s opposition to the Chinese Communist Party and his links to high-profile, right-wing US politicians and activists earned him hundreds of thousands of online followers, most of them Chinese people living in Western countries.Prosecutors say he took advantage of his prolific online presence to raise money for his ventures. But instead of being invested in businesses, the funds were allegedly funnelled into personal accounts tied to Mr Guo and Mr Je. Among other things, the money was spent on a 50,000 sq ft (4,345 sq m) mansion in New Jersey, Lamborghini, Bugatti and Ferrari sports cars, and nearly $1m worth of Chinese and Persian rugs.Prosecutors say $100 million was put into a high-risk hedge fund and other money was spent on luxury goods including a $140,000 piano, a $62,000 television and a $53,000 fireplace log cradle holder.Image source, US Justice DepartmentImage caption, Prosecutors say the funds were used to buy this custom-built Bugatti sports car, worth approximately $4.4 millionImage source, US Justice DepartmentImage caption, $2.3 million was spent on maintenance of this 145-foot luxury yachtImage caption, Guo Wengui owns the penthouse apartment of a building on Manhattan´s Upper East SideStarting in September last year, the US government seized approximately $634m of the proceeds from 21 different bank accounts.  The indictment alleges that Mr Guo built his following among opponents of the Chinese Communist Party by founding two non-profit organisations.Who is Guo Wengui?Mr Guo was a real-estate developer who reportedly became one of China´s richest men before leaving the country in 2014.In 2017, he claimed political asylum in the United States, alleging persecution by Communist Party authorities.Mr Guo has been the target of social media campaigns backing the Chinese government, but has also been accused of spreading false rumours about Covid and other subjects on his social media accounts and websites. His outspoken opposition to China´s rulers inspired several ventures with Mr Bannon. They have appeared frequently together in online videos, and in 2020, they launched a campaign called the New Federal State of China, with the goal of overthrowing the Chinese Communist Party. Later that year, Mr Bannon was arrested while on Mr Guo´s yacht in Connecticut. Mr Bannon was charged in an unrelated case with fraud in an alleged scheme to defraud people who funded a not-for-profit company to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. He has pleaded not guilty in that case, and was not named in the indictment against Mr Guo and Mr Je. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mr Guo and Mr Bannon pictured together in 2018Last year, Mr Guo´s GTV Media Group agreed to pay $539m to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US financial regulator, to settle a lawsuit alleging the company had misled investors in a cryptocurrency investment scheme. The company did not admit wrongdoing in the case.Mr Je, who also goes by the name William Je, was named in the indictment as Mr Guo´s financier. He is a dual citizen of Britain and Hong Kong, lives in London, and is still at large, authorities said. He is listed by UK Companies House as the director of two financial services companies headquartered in west London: ACA Capital and Hamilton Investment Management.Among the funds seized by US authorities were bank accounts linked to Hamilton and to Gettr, an alt-tech social media platform funded in part by Mr Guo.The BBC has contacted the companies. In a statement, one of Mr Guo´s foundations called the allegations against him ""fabricated and unwarranted"" and accused the US justice system of being controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, without providing evidence.

EU takes on US as tries to win electric car battle - BBC News,"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The EU wants to help support manufacturing of clean energyBy Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New YorkThe European Commission has unveiled a plan to try to boost manufacturing of electric cars and renewable energy projects, as it fights to compete with the US. The proposal calls for simpler regulation and faster access to funding for firms working in green industries.It would also loosen state aid rules.The move comes after the US announced big investments in climate friendly technologies, including incentives for US-made electric vehicles.  ""Major economies are rightly stepping up investment in net zero industries,"" European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said at a news conference. ""What we are looking at is that we have a global playing field.""The International Energy Agency estimates the global market for mass-produced clean energy will triple to around $650bn 9£528bn) a year by 2030, with related manufacturing jobs more than doubling. European leaders have expressed alarm that the $369bn in investments approved by the US last year will put Europe at a disadvantage economically as the industry grows, encouraging firms to relocate to America.  In the UK, business secretary Grant Shapps last month warned that the green subsidies could herald a ""dangerous"" slide into protectionism.Despite the criticism - including accusations that the US is breaking free trade rules - the White House has shown little appetite for changing its plans, which US President Joe Biden has presented as key to re-energising the American economy. ""You see I´m getting criticized internationally for focusing on America,"" he said in a speech about the economy last week.  ""To hell with that. This is real serious."" The Green Deal Industrial Plan outlined by the European Commission includes reforming the bloc´s electricity market, working on other free trade agreements and easing state aid rules, including to allow for bigger projects to qualify for aid without additional approval procedures. But designing the programme to satisfy concerns that the beneficiaries of the changes will primarily be big economies such as France and Germany will be tricky. The proposal will be debated at a meeting of the 27-member group later this month. ""Competitiveness in Europe cannot be built on state aid. But support may be needed to fulfil our objective to get rid of fossil fuels as quickly as possible,"" said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy.""We will now seek member states views before we decide on the way forward.""Related TopicsEuropean CommissionUnited StatesCarbon neutrality",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64489860,01,02,2023,bbc,usa
