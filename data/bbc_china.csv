They gathered on Wednesday for a second time in Wuhan, where Covid was first detected, and also in the north-eastern city of Dalian.The second round of protests in seven days puts pressure on President Xi Jinping´s administration just weeks before the annual National People´s Congress, which will usher in a new leadership team.Protests first took place in Wuhan on 8 February after provincial authorities said they were cutting the level of medical expenses which retirees can claim back from the government. Social media footage shows the protesters to be largely elderly retirees, who say this comes at a time of soaring healthcare costs. Although such health insurance matters are handled at a provincial level, protests have spread to different parts of the country in what appears to be a renewed belief in the power of demonstrating in China.At the end of last year, thousands of young Chinese took part in protests that eventually forced the government to overturn its strict zero-Covid measures - people had grown weary of the mass testing and sudden, sweeping lockdowns that had been smashing the economy. But the abrupt change in policy placed China´s medical system under enormous strain, as the coronavirus quickly spread through the country. It led to an unknown number of deaths and reporting by the BBC appeared to show that a vast majority of those who died were elderly. The changes to health benefits for retirees, which officials have described as reforms, come just as China emerges from that brutal Covid wave. The plan has been sold as a means of trading off reimbursement levels to increase the scope of coverage to include more areas. However criticism of plan on social media has included the widely held view that Chinese officials are trying to recoup the vast amounts of money spent on compulsory Covid testing and other pandemic measures.Officials in both Wuhan and Dalian said they had no knowledge of the most recent protests and, as such, had no comment to make. Calls to local police stations went unanswered.Radio Free Asia reported that retired iron and steel workers made up a significant proportion of the original protest group in Wuhan. The use of existing social network links could help to explain how these gatherings have been coordinated in a country where organising dissent against the government in any form is difficult and can lead to severe punishment, including prison sentences.Video clips shared on social media showed elderly protestors singing the global Communist anthem, the Internationale. In the past, this song has been used as a means of indicating that demonstrators are not against the government or the Communist Party but merely want their grievances resolved.A shopkeeper who witnessed this Wednesday´s protest in Wuhan told the BBC that police on both sides of a nearby road had blocked access to the area in order to prevent more people joining the hundreds of elderly demonstrators who were already chanting slogans.Three years of the pandemic crisis followed by a tumultuous exit from zero-Covid have generated considerable public discontent over China´s health policies. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s zero-Covid measures involved mass testingMr Xi had given the country´s Covid amelioration policies his personal stamp of approval and the Party has struggled to explain why such a sudden about-face was necessary.The Chinese government had also publicly ridiculed other countries for opening up too early, claiming they had unnecessarily sacrificed their people as a result.It then turned around and abandoned its own restrictions at an even greater speed than other nations had done, and did so after maintaining lockdowns and other harsh measures for much longer than anywhere else in the world.Many here now believe that, as a result, livelihoods were unnecessarily destroyed.On China´s Twitter-like Weibo social media platform, the hashtag #healthinsurance - in Chinese - has attracted millions of hits but was removed from the site´s ""hot topics"" section.The hashtag matching the site of the most recent protests in Wuhan - Zhongshan Park - was censored and photos claiming to be of the demonstration have been removed. However, even with China´s vast censorship apparatus swinging into action, a large amount of support is still being expressed for the protesting retirees on social media.Beijing will need to find a way to resolve the issue if it wants to avoid further public agitation.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemicTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

We´ve looked at the prevailing wind patterns and data modelling to track its possible path.Where has the balloon been seen? It was monitored travelling across Canadian territory before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, where it was spotted in the sky by city residents.US authorities say they´ve been tracking the balloon across US airspace using manned aircraft, and that it´s been flying over sensitive military areas.Blown off course, says ChinaChina says strong ""westerlies"" blew the device ""with limited self-steering capability"" off its planned course.BBC Weather´s Simon King says that in the north Pacific between China and North America, the prevailing winds are westerlies (that is, from west towards the east).""In recent days, the wind speeds above an altitude of 30,000 to 40,000ft (9,000 to 12,000m) were 150mph (240km/h) or above in this area of the Pacific,"" he says. ""There is nothing unusual about wind speeds this high in this area."" The wind patterns in the north Pacific in the past few days would have blown the balloon north-east to Alaska and then south-east through Canada to Montana, he says. ""Most weather balloons rise to about 100,000ft and then blow apart after a few hours, with the equipment falling to Earth by parachute. It is unusual for a weather balloon to last days like this.""  Dr Marina Miron, researcher in defence studies at Kings College London says the balloon might have been more sophisticated than China claims.""The balloon could be controlled remotely by an operator on the ground,"" she says. ""They´d be able to raise or lower the altitude of the balloon so that it could pick up different wind currents which are going in different directions. ""You would want to be able to make it linger over a spot to collect data. This is something you can do with balloon which you cannot do with a satellite.""   Can we track its route?  Not with any certainty. We don´t have flight tracking data that we would for commercial airliner, for example, so we need to look to other sources of information.One technique used to estimate the path of high-altitude particles or objects is to use a model based on wind speeds and direction.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric US department (NOAA) has developed such a model (known as HYSPLIT) based on winds at altitudes over 14,000m (46,000ft).  ""Its primary use,"" says Simon King from BBC Weather, ""is for working out the transport and dispersion of things such as pollutants and hazardous material in the atmosphere.  ""The model also works backwards - called back trajectory - where we can see where anything carried in the air such as pollutants, ash or other material has come from.""In the case of the balloon over the US, this back trajectory can show where the air carrying the balloon originated from and by analysing wind direction and speed, where it´ll go in the future.""US meteorologist Dan Satterfield has used this model to calculate a possible route the surveillance balloon has taken, and has shared his findings online.  Starting from the position sighted in Montana on 1 February, he has estimated a possible back trajectory for the balloon, based on wind data, originating in central China.It must be stressed that this is not the actual path the surveillance balloon has taken, but an analysis based on the model developed by NOAA, a US government agency.Related TopicsSpyingChinaReality CheckUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64514120,03,02,2023
Should China worry about its shrinking population? - BBC News,"Should China worry about its shrinking population? - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeWar in UkraineCoronavirusClimateVideoWorldUKBusinessTechScienceMoreStoriesEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsAsiaChinaIndiaShould China worry about its shrinking population?Published20 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, EPAImage caption, China´s statistics bureau said this week that its population has fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the birth rate also hitting a record lowBy Kelly NgBBC NewsChina´s population has fallen for the first time in six decades, official statistics revealed earlier this week - but this trend may not spell doom for the country in the short term, experts say.Beyond 2030, however, demographic stress will be a drag on growth in what is currently the world´s second-largest economy.The number of Chinese people fell by 850,000 from the previous year to 1.4118 billion, the statistics showed. Its birth rate had been slowing for years, prompting a range of policies to try to slow this trend, including scrapping the country´s infamous one-child policy seven years ago.But there are no easy fixes to this conundrum, economists and demographers say, given the unique trajectory in which the Chinese population has aged in recent years.While ageing populations have posed a challenge to economies around the world, the greater concern for China is the rapid pace at which this has been unfolding in the midst of its middle-income transition.In short, China is getting old before it gets rich.Its statistics bureau said this week that its population had fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the birth rate also hitting a record low - to no surprise. Some researchers believe the population decline started in 2018 and census estimates have been inaccurate.China´s population falls for first time since 1961In any case, China´s working-age population has been on a slump since 2012. Its age-dependency ratio, which is the ratio of children and retired people to the working age population, has risen from 37.12% in 2010 to 44.14% in 2020.Based on UN estimates, the number of Chinese aged between 15 and 64 will fall by more than 60% this century.But Andrew Harris, deputy chief economist at Fathom Financial Consulting, said the country had a pool of cheap rural labour that could help fill manufacturing gaps in urban areas.There is still ""significant slack"" in the manufacturing and construction sectors, Mr Harris added, noting that Fathom estimates that roughly one third of workers in the construction sector are underemployed, which means they are producing less than they potentially could.""The broader demographic story won´t bite fully on China´s growth until both of these sources of slack have been exhausted,"" he said. According to Paul Cheung, Singapore´s former chief statistician, China has ""plenty of manpower"" and ""a lot of lead time"" to manage the demographic challenge.""They are not in a doomsday scenario right away,"" Prof Cheung said.He also pointed to how countries like Japan and Singapore had managed to provide a safety net for their ageing citizenry while maintaining relative economic stability. But not everyone is as sanguine. ""The major difference between China and countries like South Korea and Japan is that its demographic (stress is) biting at much lower levels of income,"" Mr Harris said.A 2019 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that the country´s main pension fund would be depleted by 2035, in part because of its shrinking workforce.Studies by US think-tank Pew Research showed that some seven in 10 people in China already felt its public health system was under strain in 2016. A greying population and the spiralling Covid crisis have placed additional stresses on it.China´s population decline could send ripple effects across the global economy. For one, a shrinking workforce means rising labour costs, which could increase consumption and production costs. Recent reports have already shown China - long dubbed the ""factory of the world"" - losing manufacturing operations to other developing countries in Asia and South America. ""China´s shrinking labour force and manufacturing recession will lead to high prices and high inflation in the US and EU,"" said Yi Fuxian, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and longtime critic of China´s now-defunct one-child policy.Given how its recent attempts to raise fertility rates have met with limited success, China may have to look at other ways to sustain growth. BBC Future: Are there too many people?What it will mean when Indians outnumber ChineseThis will involve making hard political decisions, said George Magnus, an independent economist and associate at the China Centre at Oxford University.For instance, it should consider national legislation to raise retirement ages, Mr Magnus said. The current retirement age for most men in China is 60, while the OECD average is 64.2. The number stands at 55 for female civil servants and 50 for female blue-collar workers.However, previous calls to raise the retirement age have sparked backlash in China, with older workers not wanting to delay access to their pensions. China is already pursuing automation through robotics and artificial intelligence, but the impact on productivity is still unclear, Mr Harris said.Another solution would be to bolster the population through immigration, although this is not an option that the Chinese Communist Party has favoured historically, he noted.Although China can no longer rely on its demographic dividend to fuel its economy, that may not be a bad thing if it manages to seek growth from other sources such as productivity, some observers say.""We should be much more nuanced about the stall in China´s population growth. Planetary sustainability and urban congestion are better served by a more stable world population, which may entail declines in some countries,"" Mr Magnus said.""Demography is not destiny. The key is to get these and other nations to focus like a laser beam on ´coping mechanisms´.""You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: The past, present and future of global population explained - by the BBC´s Stephanie HegartyRelated TopicsPopulation growthAsiaChinaEconomic growth",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64329890,20,01,2023

Others complained about the efficacy of online learning in relation to in-person teaching and the extra strains put on working parents.Following its abandonment of its zero-Covid strategy, there has been an explosion of self-reported cases across the country, with many cities eerily quiet as large numbers of people isolate at home, either sick with Covid or trying to avoid becoming infected, reports the BBC´s Celia Hatton.There are concerns that China´s health infrastructure is not prepared to cope with a rapid increase in patients - especially as Covid spreads among the elderly, many of whom are not fully vaccinated.Related TopicsChinaShanghaiCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64010209,17,12,2022

But reports of the surge in China and the memories of two deadly Covid waves in 2020 and 2021 in India have made many people fearful.But experts say there is no reason to worry right now.""The infection surge in China is on expected lines. If you have a susceptible population that is not exposed to the virus, cases will rise. Nothing has changed for the rest of the world, including India,"" says Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist. China has been struggling with a rush of Covid cases after it started moving away from its so-called zero-Covid approach which mandated strict lockdowns, quarantining and closed borders. The country is now trying to ramp up vaccinations for its vulnerable elderly population as the case surge strains healthcare systems.The surge has also led some experts raising doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - can provide long-term immunity.""People are getting infected because BF.7 [the Omicron subvariant that reports say is driving the surge in China] is highly infectious and escapes all previous immunity. If you don´t have immunity, you get more diseases which will affect the elderly and immunosuppressed populations,"" says virologist Dr Jacob John.Over the past few months, India reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7 - all the patients have recovered, health officials say.""Covid is still around, people are still getting infected and getting admitted to hospitals. So it´s not that we´re free of Covid, but it´s become like another upper respiratory tract infection, like influenza,"" says epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant.The low caseload in India can be largely attributed to the immunity Indians have already gained over the past three years.Dr A Fathahudeen, a prominent critical care expert who has treated thousands of Covid patients, says that India´s ""hybrid immunity wall"" against Covid-19 is ""satisfactory"" as a majority of people have either taken two doses of the vaccine or gained natural immunity from contracting the disease earlier.He also points out that the vaccines used in India are ""more efficacious than the ones used in China"".India has administered more than 2.2 billion doses of the Covid vaccine so far, including for both doses and the booster shot, which India calls a ""precaution dose"".He says people should take the booster dose if they haven´t already - only around 27% of the population have got it so far. It´s an appeal that other experts broadly agree with.""With time, the level of antibodies go down. So a third shot is always beneficial and will increase the level of antibodies,"" Dr Lahariya says, adding that it´s good for people above 60 years of age.""Among the 18-59 year age group, those who are high-risk can get boosters. For others, it´s a personal call,"" he adds.Experts also agree with the government´s decision to step up genome sequencing which allows scientists to identify new strains.""The current testing strategy of random genome sequencing of 2% of international travellers is enough to pick up any new variant,"" says Dr Fathahudeen.Dr John says that the best mantra for the government and ordinary people to follow is ""expect the best and prepare for the worst"".""Make it a habit to wear masks in crowded places - watching a football or cricket match, or on a crowded bus or train,"" he says, adding that he recommends creating ""long-term, sustainable behavioural changes"".India had relaxed its mask-wearing rules earlier this year after a drop in infection levels, and it´s now common to see people in crowded areas without any precautions.The bottom-line is ""be cautious, wear a mask and watch the news"", Dr John says. Dr Fathahudeen agrees, saying unnecessary crowding should be discouraged and people should wear masks if large gatherings can´t be avoided.

I did not want to invest too much,"" she says.After two months of deliberation, she chose the OnePlus 10R, which in a sale cost her $400 (£329), a reasonable price for a smartphone, but still a significant sum in any country, and particularly in a developing one like India.""The idea was to buy a phone which did not make a hole in my pocket and had good features. I am happy with the phone I have purchased,"" she says.Ms Aswani´s new smartphone was made by a Chinese firm in India - a common arrangement these days.But as recently as 2014, the majority of phones sold in India would have been imported. That has all changed in recent years. In 2022 almost all phones sold in India were made there as well, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA).Many of those phones would have been made by overseas firms with operations in India, like Taiwan´s Foxconn or South Korea´s Samsung.But the number of home-grown firms is increasing rapidly.Image source, MicromaxImage caption, Micromax has become one of India´s biggest makers of mobile phonesMicromax Informatics is one of those challengers. It entered the mobile handset business in 2008. In just two years it grew to become one of India´s biggest makers of cheaper phones, known as feature phones. Despite that growth, Micromax co-founder Rajesh Agarwal says it is hard to compete with Chinese smartphone makers.When his firm launches a new phone, he can hope to sell about a million units in India. But a Chinese phone maker can sell 10 million phones, or more, which gives them a big cost advantage.""They have huge strength in terms of production,"" he says.On top of that, Chinese firms can source almost all of their components locally.India does make some parts, including chargers, cables and batteries, but the more sophisticated parts, like screens and computer chips are almost always made abroad.Image source, MicromaxImage caption, Micromax co-founder Rajesh Agarwal says India needs to make all the components that go into a phone""As far as the manufacturing is concerned - it is the beginning. We have to become our own kitchen where we are able to produce all our components locally,"" says Mr Agarwal.""The final goal would be to transition from being a producer for domestic consumption to serving global demand, not just for phones but laptops, tablets and other devices,"" he adds.The Indian government is hoping to accelerate that move. In April 2021 it launched the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Telecom and Networking Equipment.It is the latest part of a government policy, which goes back years, aiming to increase all types of manufacturing in India.The PLI scheme subsidises mobile phone components that are made in India. It is hoped that will make them more competitive and boost production.According to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), at the moment between 15% and 20% of the parts that make up an Indian phone are made in India. The aim of the PLI scheme is to raise that to between 35% and 40%.Image source, MicromaxImage caption, At the moment only about 20% of components in Indian phones are made in India""The production-linked incentive scheme is a game changer for electronics manufacturing,"" says ICEA chairman Pankaj Mohindroo.""India is currently one of the fastest growing mobile phone manufacturers in the world and has emerged as the second largest manufacturer of mobile handsets in the world,"" he says.Mobile phones are the biggest single component of India´s electronic exports and next year are expected to make up 50% of electronics exports, according to the ICEA.""India will become the next global hub for cell phone manufacturers,"" predicts Hari Om Rai, the chairman of Indian phone maker Lava International.  He points out that China, as it has become richer and seen wages rising, has lost some of the cost advantage that it had over other nations.More technology of business:Tech trends 2023: Flying taxis and satellite phonesThe cargo hauling aircraft with no pilots on boardSkilled tech workers snapped up despite downturnTropical vineyards put India on the wine mapSecond-hand tech booms as shoppers look for bargainsAlso, Mr Om Rai says firms all over the world are worried about becoming overly reliant on products from China. And the disruption at Apple´s key supplier in the city of Zhengzhou is unlikely to have lessened those worries.If firms want to locate manufacturing elsewhere then, according to Mr Om Rai, India is an attractive option.""India has 18% of the world´s population, with a mere 3.1% of the GDP. As the country´s GDP grows, it will become one of the world´s largest markets. Looking at the long-term potential, every company is trying to establish itself and outcompete its competitors in India,"" he says.Back in Mumbai, all this industrial policy is of little interest to Deepa Aswani.""It does not bother me where my smartphone is manufactured. I think as a consumer all that matters is budget and features,"" she says. ""As a smartphone buyer I would look at the country which has advanced technology and is pocket friendly.""Related TopicsMobile phonesIndiaTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

The US has also imposed sanctions on a Chinese company which Washington says has provided satellite imagery in support of Russian mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine. US sanctions Chinese firm helping Russia´s WagnerWhat is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?Russia´s most important trading partnerAfter Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Western nations imposed strict sanctions on Russia - banning imports of oil and exports of hi-tech products.Many Western firms cut their connections with Russia entirely, and its trade with the US, UK, and EU countries slumped over the course of 2022.However, China´s overall trade with Russia hit a record high level of $190bn in 2022 - a 30% increase on the year before.Russian imports from China increased 13% to $76bn and its exports to China increased by 43% to $114bn.As Russia´s trade with Western countries plunged in 2022, China became, by far and away, its most important trading partner.How much oil and gas is China buying from Russia?  Almost half of all the Russian government´s annual revenues come from oil and gas, and its sales to EU countries has plummeted over the past year as sanctions bite.  A significant amount of this shortfall has been made up with increased sales to Asia.Who is buying Russian oil and gasRussia exported twice as much liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to China in 2022 than it did the year before. It also delivered 50% more natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline, and 10% more crude oil. The G7 group of economically developed countries, along with the European Union and Australia, has tried to impose a worldwide cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea, but China has refused to comply and buys Russian crude at market prices.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China´s terminal in Tianjin receives liquified natural gas from RussiaThere are also longer term plans to expand energy ties.

Ms Truss will address a conference of global politicians in Japan this month designed to coordinate the policies of democratic governments towards Beijing. Since she resigned in October, Ms Truss has kept a low profile. But recently her allies have formed a group to push her low-tax agenda.Members of the Conservative Growth Group include former ministers Simon Clarke and Ranil Jayawardena, who both served in Ms Truss´s cabinet. Ms Truss resigned after just 45 days in office, following the economic turmoil of her mini-budget. Golden era of UK-China relations over, says SunakLiz Truss: 11 gambles that went wrong In December the former prime minister met like-minded Republicans during a trip to Washington. However, her speech to the conference in Japan will be her first public outing overseas since leaving office. The conference is organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which seeks to coordinate international pressure on Beijing.  The cross-party group of politicians works on issues including upholding human rights and promoting trade fairness. In her speech, Ms Truss is expected to focus on the threat to Taiwan. She will also be joined by two other former prime ministers - Scott Morrison of Australia and Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium.Diplomats will watch closely to see if Ms Truss adopts a harder line than her former government, which still hopes to cooperate with China on climate change and trade. In November, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the so-called ""golden era"" of relations with China was over and that the closer economic ties of the previous decade had been ""naïve"". But he stressed ""we cannot simply ignore China´s significance in world affairs - to global economic stability or issues like climate change"".Ms Truss´s predecessor as prime minister, Boris Johnson, has also re-emerged on the global stage since leaving office. Last month, he visited Kyiv, where he met President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian ministers. Related TopicsLiz TrussChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64509979,03,02,2023

The incident has sparked widespread public outrage, with many accusing the man of deliberately targeting people.Videos posted online show the driver getting out of the car and throwing banknotes into the air, shortly after the crash.Police have detained the 22-year-old man and launched an investigation.The crash took place on Wednesday during the evening rush hour at a busy junction in the southern city of 19 million.""He deliberately drove into the people who were waiting for the traffic light. He rammed the car into them maliciously. After that, he made a U-turn and hit people again,"" an eyewitness told local outlet Hongxin News.""He wasn´t driving too quickly, but some people couldn´t run away in time because they wouldn´t have known he was hitting people deliberately.""The man also reportedly drove into a traffic police officer and his motorcycle, but the officer managed to escape. One widely circulated clip shows a young girl lying on the ground at the scene of the incident, while a woman said to be her mother is seen by her side wailing.Another eyewitness described the chaos of the aftermath on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter. The person said that an hour after the incident, the site was still filled with ambulances and traffic police ""and they had not moved all the injured and the bodies from the scene"". ""The scene was too tragic and I couldn´t bear seeing it. I felt so sad that I wanted to throw up whenever I heard the siren of the ambulance,"" the person said.The incident has sparked public anger, with many expressing sorrow that it happened in the lead-up to Chinese New Year, a time for family reunions. ""The victims could be a girl who dressed up meticulously to go on a date… It could be a food deliveryman who earned five yuan after rushing an order. It could be a father who wanted to go home and have dinner with children. It could be a child who was happily shopping,"" one Weibo user wrote.Many noted that the man drove a luxury car and had thrown money into the air, and asked if he came from a rich and powerful family.The incident quickly became a trending topic on Weibo on Wednesday, but it later disappeared from the ""hot searches"" list, leading users to accuse the platform of censorship.There have been similar recent incidents. In February 2022, a driver ploughed a mini truck into people in the southern province of Fujian, killing three and injuring nine. Earlier this week, a hotel guest in Shanghai deliberately drove his car into the lobby following an argument with staff.

Holding out against China in a row over reefs - BBC News,"Holding out against China in a row over reefs - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeWar in UkraineCoronavirusClimateVideoWorldUKBusinessTechScienceMoreStoriesEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsAsiaChinaIndiaHolding out against China in a row over reefsPublished16 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Philippine Coast GuardImage caption, The Philippines has accused China of shining lasers on one of its boats - which Beijing deniesBy Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, ManilaChina has had an unusually busy and bizarre week. On Monday - as the saga over the alleged spy balloon dragged into its 11th day - a fresh spat erupted between Beijing and Manila. This one was over lasers. The Philippines accused China of using a ""military grade"" laser light on a Philippine coastguard boat. It said the incident had happened on 6 February when the boat  was attempting to take supplies to the Sierra Madre, a vessel that is used as a Filipino naval outpost in the South China Sea; and that a Chinese vessel intercepted the Filipino coast guard boat, blocked its way and used a laser device to temporarily blind the crew. It´s not clear what sort of device the Chinese crew used or how powerful it was, but laser weapons designed to damage eyesight are banned under UN convention. The incident has been quickly condemned by a host of countries including the United States, Australia, Japan and Germany.  China for its part defended its right to use lasers to protect its ""sovereignty"", and then denied shining the light at the Filipino crew, saying they had used a ""hand-held laser speed detector and hand-held greenlight pointer"", neither of which are dangerous. All this over a submerged reef. In 2014, the BBC visited the South China Sea in search of the Sierra Madre. As the sun rose across the South China Sea, the horizon showed no sign of our quarry. ""Don´t worry,"" shouted the skipper who was taking us to the ship above the sound of the engine, ""I know where I´m going. It´s on the reef over there."" He pointed north and out of the morning mist appeared a rusting grey hulk sitting, grounded, atop the vast submerged reef visible just a few feet below the water. The Sierra Madre was not a particularly grand ship even in its youth. Built as a tank landing ship during World War Two, it served with the US navy in the Vietnam war. In 1970 she was transferred to the South Vietnamese navy, and after the fall of Saigon in 1975 she ended up in the Philippines. In 1999 the ageing ship was deliberately beached on top of this reef 160km (100 miles) off the Philippine coast. Image caption, The Sierra Madre is beached on the Second Thomas ShoalAs the little fishing boat drew close, large holes rusted right through the ship´s hull became visible. It looked like the next typhoon would wash her away.  Nearly 10 years on, the Sierra Madre is somehow still holding together, more rust and concrete, than steel. And a tiny contingent of Filipino marines still live a precarious existence aboard. The actions of the Chinese coastguard ship in blocking the Philippine vessel may also breach international law. Whatever Beijing says, the waters around the rusting Sierra Madre do not belong to China. In 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague made a clear ruling. China´s claim to a large swathe of the South China Sea, often defined as the nine-dash line, has no basis in international law. Of course, it´s not quite as simple as that.  There are numerous claims and counter-claims to the islands, reefs and waters of the South China Sea. China´s is only the most expansive. The Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia all have their own overlapping claims to smaller bits of the sea. And most of those claims are also not supported by international law. The Philippines´ rusting Sierra Madre sits atop a reef variously known as Second Thomas Shoal, Ayungin Shoal and - in Chinese - Ren-ai Reef. But a submerged reef is not land and controlling a reef does not give a country any new territorial waters and does not expand its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). There is almost no real land in the South China Sea. In the most hotly contested area, known as the Spratly Islands, there are a handful of tiny islets. The biggest is called Taiping Dao. It´s just 1,000 metres long and 400 metres wide. By an accident of history, it has ended up under the control of Taiwan. The second biggest is called Pagasa. You can walk around it in half an hour. Pagasa was snatched by the Philippines in 1971, when the Taiwanese troops stationed there withdrew to escape a powerful typhoon. Vietnam has a few other scraps of land. But China, distracted by the internal turmoil of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, was too late - and ended up with no real land. So, it decided to make its own. In 2014, while a handful of Filipino marines clung to the rusting decks of the Sierra Madre, 40km (25 miles) away on another atoll called Mischief Reef, China had begun a massive land reclamation project. The world´s largest ocean-going dredgers were pumping millions of tonnes of gravel and sand on to the top of the reef creating a huge artificial island. The new land China has made at Mischief Reef is well inside the Philippines´ internationally recognised 320 km (200 mile) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The new island is not recognised by international law. It does not give China the right to 20 km (12 mile) territorial waters. But that has not stopped Beijing from using its large coastguard and maritime militia fleet, to enforce its claims, and to drive away Philippine fishermen and challenge Philippine coastguard vessels.China´s new islands are what military strategists call ""facts on the ground"" -  in other words this is the reality, rather than an abstract legal concept. The fear in Manila is that China´s ambitions do not stop at Mischief Reef. Ayungin Shoal could be next. That´s why the rusting hulk of the Sierra Madre holds such symbolic importance here. It´s also why after a 30-year absence, the government of President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr, is opening the door for large numbers of US troops to return to bases in the Philippines.

These fly at nine times the speed of sound and have a range of 1,000 km (620 miles).  Moscow ""will be trying to show that despite its setbacks in the war in Ukraine, its armed forces are still very powerful"", says Denys Reva from South Africa´s Institute for Security Studies.The SANDF has said little about the forthcoming exercise, but a 2019 joint drill between the three countries involved seven ships - one warship from each nation, plus fuelling ships and survey ships. They practised tackling coastal fires and floods, and recapturing ships from pirates.How Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaWhy is this exercise controversial?A White House spokesperson said in January: ""The United States has concerns about any country... exercising with Russia as Russia wages a brutal war against Ukraine.""South Africa previously abstained from a UN vote condemning the invasion. It also refused to join the US and Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia. The South African government sparked a political row when it gave permission for a superyacht called the Nord, which is linked to the sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov, to dock in Cape Town - although it is thought the vessel did not actually go there.The sanctioned Russian cargo ship, Lady R, was also allowed to unload supplies at a South African naval base. The government said it contained a delayed order for ammunition.South Africa points out it has held four joint exercises with the US since 2011, as well as drills with France and Germany.""All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,"" said Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, during a visit to her country by her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in January.She said that trying to stop South Africa from conducting joint military exercises with the countries of its choice amounted to ""an abuse of international practice"".What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Why is South Africa taking part?South Africa is also taking part because its armed forces are underfunded and overstretched, according to Elizabeth Sidiropoulos, head of the South African Institute of International Affairs. The navy´s priorities are to protect fisheries in its home waters and combat piracy in the Indian Ocean.""It needs to team up with other nations to have the capacity to deal with things off its coast such as piracy,"" she says.Image source, ReutersImage caption, South African foreign minister Nalida Pandor hosted a visit from her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in JanuarySouth Africa´s governing African National Congress (ANC) also has long-standing ties with Russia. These date back to the years of white-minority rule before 1994, says Dr Alex Vines from the Chatham House think-tank in London.""The older leaders in the ANC still have an emotional attachment to Moscow, because it constantly supported their struggle,"" he says. ""That makes it very difficult for South Africa to turn its back on Russia over Ukraine.""Russia, China and South Africa also have modern-day ties because they are all members of the Brics alliance.The group - which also includes Brazil and India - represents some of the world´s leading emerging economies.What do Russia and China want?Ms Sidiropoulos says Russia has more to gain than anyone from this year´s exercise. ""It shows that Russia can still project its power far away, and that it still has allies around the world.""It lets them say that it´s not the world that´s against Russia.

It also scrapped a cap on the daily number of flights.On the same day, the National Health Commission announced that Covid would be formally downgraded to a Class B infectious disease on 8 January.Before the relaxation of travel rules, people were strongly discouraged from travelling abroad. The sale of outbound group and package travel was banned, according to marketing solutions company Dragon Trail International.Within half an hour of Monday´s notice that China´s borders would reopen, data from travel site Trip.com - cited in Chinese media - showed searches for popular destinations had increased ten-fold year-on-year. Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and South Korea were the most popular destinations.Image source, ReutersIn addition, Chinese travel agency Qunar saw flight enquiries on its website increase seven-fold within the first 15 minutes after the announcement, the China Daily reports.Before the pandemic, the number of outbound tourists from China stood at 155 million in 2019, according to Statista. This number dropped to 20 million in 2020.This year, some people in China will hope to visit family and loved ones during Chinese New Year, which begins on 22 January.But inside China, there has been a mixed reaction.""I´m happy about it but also speechless. If we´re doing this [reopening] anyway - why did I have to suffer all the daily Covid tests and lockdowns this year?"" said Rachel Liu, who lives in Shanghai.She said she had endured three months of lockdown in April - but nearly everyone in her family had become infected in recent weeks.She said her parents, grandparents and partner - living across three different cities in Xi´an, Shanghai and Hangzhou - had all come down with fever last week.Many have also expressed concern online about borders reopening as Covid cases peak.""Why can´t we wait until this wave passes to open up? The medical workers are already worn out, and old people won´t survive two infections in one month,"" read one top-liked comment on Weibo.People in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, which experience chilly temperatures in the winter, say they´re running out of flu and cold medicine. It´s feared that hundreds of deaths may be going unreported as crematoriums are overwhelmed. In the capital, Beijing, authorities say they are planning to distribute the Pfizer tablets, Paxlovid, in order to try to reduce the severity of infections. But health centres contacted by The Global Times on Monday said the drug had yet to be delivered.On Monday, President Xi issued his first remarks on the changes, calling on officials to do what was ""feasible"" to save lives.China´s about-turn has put Mr Xi in a tough spot. He was the driving force behind zero-Covid, which many blamed for restricting people´s lives excessively and crippling the economy. But having abandoned it, analysts say he now has to take responsibility for the huge wave of infections and hospital admissions. Many have questioned why the country was not better prepared.Are you hoping to visit China in the new year to see family?

Li Qiang, the former Communist Party leader of the country´s biggest city of Shanghai, will now lead the government, replacing retiring Li Keqiang.The 63-year-old received almost every vote from more than 2,900 delegates at the National People´s Congress.A close ally of Mr Xi, he is seen as a pragmatist and will be tasked with reviving China´s struggling economy.New ministerial appointments are expected to be announced on Sunday.No reporters were allowed in the room while ballots were cast during a meeting of China´s rubber-stamp parliament. There was applause as Mr Xi cast his vote. Mr Li - who is now the second-highest ranking official in China´s political system - received a total of 2,936 votes, with just three delegates voting against his appointment and eight abstaining.He then took an oath, swearing to be loyal to China´s constitution and to ""work hard to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilised, harmonious and great modern socialist country"".Mr Li was President Xi´s chief of staff in the early 2000s, when Mr Xi was party chief of Zhejiang province. Mr Li was made party secretary of Shanghai in 2017.During the pandemic, he oversaw Shanghai´s strict lockdown, which led to some residents struggling to access food and medical care. His appointment comes after Mr Xi secured a historic third term as president on Friday.The president has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests. The country is also facing a falling birth rate that threatens its economic growth engine.The so-called Two Sessions of the National People´s Congress and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into China´s direction in the coming years.Since Mao Zedong, leaders in China had been limited to two terms in office.

But China has stopped publishing daily cases data, and has announced only 22 Covid deaths since December, using its own strict criteria.""We believe that definition [of a Covid death] is too narrow,"" WHO emergencies director Dr Michael Ryan said.Dr Ryan said China´s figures ""under-represent the true impact of the disease in terms of hospital admissions, in terms of ICU admissions, and particularly in terms of deaths"".China last month changed its criteria for what constitutes a Covid death, meaning only those who die of respiratory illnesses are counted. This goes against WHO guidance, which encourages countries to count the number of excess deaths - how many more people die than would normally be expected based on death figures before the pandemic hit.Dr Ryan added that China had increased its engagement with the WHO in recent weeks, and said he looked forward to receiving ""more comprehensive data.""But he also suggested individual health workers could report their own data and experiences.""We do not discourage doctors and nurses reporting these deaths and these cases,"" Dr Ryan said. ""We have an open approach to be able to record the actual impact of disease in society.""The UK science data company Airfinity estimates more than two million Covid cases a day in China, and 14,700 deaths.Since China abandoned key parts of its ""zero-Covid"" strategy almost a month ago, there have been reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed.More than a dozen nations have introduced travel restrictions on travellers from China. Beijing has criticised these as politically motivated and threatened to retaliate.On Wednesday, the European Union issued new guidance ""strongly"" recommending that all member states introduce the requirement that passengers flying from China provide a negative Covid test before their departure. No new Covid variants have been detected in China, despite the surge in cases. However, the WHO has warned this could be due to a decrease in testing. What is known about new Covid variant XBB.1.5?The Chinese authorities have announced they are sending medical supplies to rural hospitals before an expected wave of coronavirus infections in the countryside - where vaccination rates are patchy. Dr Abdi Rahman Mahamud, director of the WHO´s alert and response coordination department, has warned China may see another wave of infections as families gather for China´s Lunar New Year in a few weeks - one of the country´s busiest travel periods.

The Daily Mail says the ""drastic"" step of reimposing controls is over fears Beijing is withholding data on the virus, while the FT Weekend notes that Conservative MPs were calling on the government to act.But in the Daily Telegraph, former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith says the restrictions must not become a ""slippery slope"" to more tests and lockdowns. The Times leads on a warning from Professor Sir Chris Whitty that thousands of middle-aged people are dying of heart conditions because they did not get statins or blood pressure medicines during the pandemic. England´s chief medical officer, is said to have ""raised the alarm"" in government that Britain is now starting to see the after-effects of people staying away from GP surgeries. However, the paper says that ambulance delays could also be to blame for heart attacks and strokes not being treated promptly. ""King knights Queen"" declares The Sun´s headline, as it leads on the guitarist Brian May being given a knighthood in the New Year Honours. Sir Brian is quoted as saying he will use the title to ""fight for justice"". The i Weekend says a row has ""erupted"" over the decision to recognise just four members of the England women´s football team that won the European Championships. Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell says the decision is ""out of sync"" with other sporting victories, but the chairman of the sports honours committee, Sir Hugh Robertson, says the selective approach was to avoid a situation where ""people who´ve done five minutes on the pitch... get an award"".The Daily Express leads on data from the Labour Party that shows more than 700 prisoners have escaped or been released in error from jails during the past decade. In one case, a sex offender raped a 16-year-old girl and sexually assaulted another young woman after being mistakenly released by the prison service. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said releases in error are extremely rare and there have been just 15 prison escapes since 2010, 90% fewer than in the preceding 12 years.A number of papers feature predictions for the new year, with the i Weekend suggesting that ministers are ""gearing up for strikes to dominate the news agenda in the coming months"". The Times says there is ""trouble ahead"" for the prime minister, with inflation, NHS waiting lists and immigration the biggest issues he needs to tackle. The Daily Mirror suggests we could see another summer of heatwaves. In an unconventional avian and celebrity crossover story, ""Russell Crowe saves a crow called Russell"" headlines The Sun, as it reports on a fundraising effort to help a bird in need. The owners of the feathered version of Crowe needed £1,500 for an operation because of a serious eye infection. The target was beaten, in part because of £500 pounds donated online by the Hollywood superstar. The paper has confirmed Russell´s surgery has gone well, calling it a story with a ""flappy ending"".

Families that broke the rules were fined and, in some cases, even lost jobs.The limit was increased nationally for married couples to two in 2016, and boosted further to three in 2021. But one province - Sichuan - has adopted even looser rules. Mr Yang - who heads the country´s Population Monitoring and Family Development department - said officials had to ""firmly grasp the important window period of population development"". Speaking to a state-backed health magazine, Mr Yang said concerns about the cost of childcare were having a detrimental impact on population growth. He also identified challenges around money and career goals as causes for the decline. ""Local governments should be encouraged to actively explore and make bold innovations in reducing the cost of childbirth, childcare and education"" to promote the long-term balanced development of the population, Mr Yang said. Should China worry about its shrinking population?Mothers, your country needs you!Some provinces have already begun implementing new measures to try to boost the birth rate, including giving money to sperm donors.In Sichuan, health authorities said they would allow unmarried couples to raise a family and enjoy benefits reserved for married couples. Previously there was a ban on single women registering a birth.Authorities in the region also announced that couples would be allowed to have as many children as they want - a major reversal of the one-child policy. A shrinking population, falling birth rate and the prospect of a fast-aging population poses a long-term challenge to the world´s second largest economy, which only recently dropped ultra-strict Covid-19 curbs.In 2022, the population dropped by 850,000 people to 1.41175 billion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. It was the first decline since 1961, the last year of China´s Great Famine.A surging Indian population also threatens to overtake China and push it down to second place.Related TopicsPopulation growthAsiaChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64594469,10,02,2023

The regulations were updated following an outcry five years ago when a Chinese scientist said he had created the world´s first gene-edited babies.China says the new laws are in line with international rules.They set requirements for ethical approval, supervision and inspection, but experts worry that they may not apply to the private sector.China jails ´gene-edited babies´ scientistGene editing technique could transform futureDr Zhang,  one of the main speakers at an international human genome-editing summit in London, told BBC News: ""My biggest concern is that the new measures fail to cover a chronic and increasing problem in trying to deal with private ventures that are taking place outside of conventional scientific institutes.""The new rules may struggle to keep up with the burgeoning innovation that is happening in China.´´Gene editing is a new technique that enables scientists to make precise changes to DNA. Scientists believe it could be used to correct many inherited diseases. It is controversial, though, because it raises the possibility of making permanent changes to a person´s genetic make-up that will be passed down to their offspring. A controversial experimentThe world´s leading scientists in the field were stunned when Dr He Jiankui, from Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, claimed five years ago that he had created the world´s first gene-edited babies - twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana.The girls´ DNA had been altered while they were at an early embryonic stage in a way that Dr He claimed would make them resistant to HIV infection. He was fined and sentenced to three years in prison in 2019. No-one, other than Dr He, has had access to the twins. But at a recent scientific meeting, he said they were in good health.Upon his release, it emerged last month that he was planning to set up a clinic in Hong Kong to research using gene editing to develop a treatment for children with a rare inherited muscular disorder, called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Immigration officials announced that they had rescinded his visa after they discovered he had a criminal record.The new rules close the loopholes that enabled Dr He to evade regulations, which previously only applied to experiments on human beings in hospitals, for example for drug trials. The updated regulations cover all research institutions and everything relating to humans, including work on tissues, organs and embryonic cells. Image source, He JiankuiLabImage caption, Dr He Jiankui served a three-year prison sentence following claims that he created the world´s first gene-edited children five years ago.The summit organiser, Prof Robin Llovell-Badge, from the Crick Institute, where the meeting is being held, said he was concerned that there was still too much secrecy in Chinese research.´´I understand why China wants to be leaders in technology, but there are some areas that require special attention and gene editing is one of them,"" he said. ´´It has to be done properly and with the appropriate governance and oversight, and I´m concerned that they are not there yet.´´Speaking at the summit, Dr Yangin Peng, of the Chinese Academy of Science, said the government has ""accelerated"" laws and regulations in gene editing.""China has considerably tightened its legislation and regulations,"" he said. ""Permanent, inherited changes are banned, governance has adopted a precautionary approach and our laws are in line with international rules.""Image source, SPLDr Francoise Baylis, a Canadian bioethicist from Dalhousie University, said she wanted more details of the updates to China´s rules.´´I saw [that in the updated rules] research should be in line with ethical principles.

But once it became clear that the secretary of state wasn´t coming, and that the balloon was not coming back either, the gloves were off.It is a long way from where the Chinese government wanted things to be at this moment.The US Secretary of State was supposed to be here building bridges or at least trying to stop those that still exist from being destroyed.US shoots down Chinese ´spy´ balloon over AtlanticWhy use a spy balloon instead of satellites?Was China balloon blown off course?Make no mistake. Chinese President Xi Jinping had great hopes for this visit and was, reportedly, even going to meet Mr Blinken himself.So what balloon-gathered intelligence could be so good that it was worth scuppering this process? The short answer is none. Which is why many analysts think that, even if it was to some extent spying, the deployment of this balloon, in this way, at this time, had to have been an error on the Chinese side. And, if that is the case, somebody is getting hauled over the coals for it, especially given that there are now two of these high-altitude balloons in play, with another floating above Latin America. There has been no word whether it too is supposed to have been blown wildly off course, given its ""limited self-steering capability"".Internationally, many seem to imagine that China´s Communist Party is an all-knowing, locked in, organ of power - something along the lines of a giant, efficient, supercomputer with Xi Jinping toggling the controls.It is a massive, sprawling organisation, that is certain. However, it is also made up of departments and power blocks competing for influence, at times hoarding information and even deliberately not foreshadowing their actions lest a rival gain some unwanted advantage.When a clearly visible, equipment-carrying balloon started floating close to US nuclear missile siloes, the assumption from some had been not only that it was spying but that it must have been sent as a message to the Biden administration.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Antony Blinken was expected in China on 5 and 6 FebruaryBut when you consider the damage it has done in terms of derailing a visit that the Chinese government, right up to the very top, wanted to happen, it is hard to see how this analysis stacks up.We know that the Blinken trip was important here because we saw how Beijing tried to save it using quite conciliatory language.""The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure,"" a foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying.The extent to which it was deployed to study the weather or spy doesn´t really matter in terms of understanding how crushing this incident has been for those on both sides who have been looking for ways to ease US-China tensions.An enormous breakthrough was not expected from Mr Blinken´s meetings in Beijing. The meetings themselves were to be the breakthrough.They would have spoken about moves towards a set of ""guard rails"", means of communication and lines not to cross in an attempt to prevent a drift towards armed conflict.President Xi also wanted it because he´s looking for some big signs back at home that his administration knows what it is doing when it comes to steering China into the future.A sudden and embarrassing retreat from the zero-Covid approach came just months after China´s leader had declared at the Party Congress that there would be no swerving from it.Then the speed of the about-face led to overcrowded hospital emergency rooms, medicine shortages and an unknown Covid death toll.The government now needs to put all this behind it and encourage an image of a China which is turning around economically and opening up again.A high-level US visit would have been quite useful in this regard.Examine the protestations from the major superpowers this week. Washington has said this was a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"" but we all know that it has plenty of its own very sophisticated means of spying on China.Beijing has condemned this US ""attack on a civilian unmanned airship"" but we all know that if a US surveillance balloon flew into Chinese airspace the People´s Liberation Army would have it down in no time.In a way, this means that the outrage from both sides contains a fair bit of theatre. The upside is that, now the balloon is no more, they will be able to move on from it and reschedule a Beijing visit by Mr Blinken at a time when people are asking each other, ""hey do you remember that whole balloon thing?"".Related TopicsXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaCommunist Party of ChinaDiplomacyUnited StatesChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64529922,06,02,2023

China scrapped its strict zero-Covid policy in December and has seen a rapid surge of infections and deaths. There are reports of hospitals and crematoria becoming overwhelmed.But the country has stopped publishing daily cases data, and has announced only 22 Covid deaths since December, using its own strict criteria.Now only those who die from respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia are counted.On Wednesday the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that China was under-representing the true impact of Covid in the country - in particular deaths.How is China trying to beat its latest Covid surge?China under-representing Covid deaths, WHO warnsBut the deaths of Chu Lanlan and others is sparking speculation about greater losses than those reported on official accounts.According to the specialist news website Operawire, Chu Lanlan was a soprano who specialised in Peking Opera - a theatrical art in which performers use speech, song, dance and combat movements to tell stories - and was also involved in charitable causes. On New Year´s Day news of the death of actor Gong Jintang devastated many Chinese internet users. Image source, Guangdong TVImage caption, Gong Jintang was known for his performance in the country´s longest-running TV series, In-Laws, Out-laws.Gong, 83, was known to many households for his performance in the country´s longest-running TV series, In-Laws, Out-laws. His portrait of Father Kang had captivated fans for more than two decades since the show first aired in 2000.The cause of his death is unclear, but many social media users linked it to the recent deaths of other older people.""Please god, please treat the elderly better,"" his co-star Hu Yanfen wrote on Chinese social media platform Weibo.""R.I.P Father Kang. This wave have really claimed many elders´ lives, let´s make sure we protect the elderly in our families,"" one user wrote on Weibo.Acclaimed scriptwriter Ni Zhen was also among recent deaths. The 84-year-old was famous for his work on the 1991 film Raise the Red Lantern, which is widely considered to be one of the best Chinese films by critics.Meanwhile Hu Fuming, a former journalist and retired professor of Nanjing University, died on 2 January at the age of 87. He was the main author of a famous commentary published in 1978 that marked the start of the China´s ""Boluan Fanzheng"" period - a time of eliminating chaos and returning to normal after the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution under the country´s first Communist leader Mao Zedong.Image source, Phoenix TV Image caption, Hu Fuming was a well known scholar and authorAccording to a tally by Chinese media, 16 scientists from the country´s top science and engineering academies died between 21 and 26 December.None of these deaths were linked to Covid in their obituaries, but that hasn´t prevented speculation online.""Did he also die of ´bad flu´?"" one of the top-rated comments under news of Mr Ni´s death said.""Even if you trawl through the whole internet you can´t find any reference to his cause of death,"" said another internet user.But there was also criticism of demonstrators who took to the streets in November in rare political protests calling for the end of leader Xi Jinping´s zero-Covid policy.""Are those people happy now, seeing old people... now paving the way for their freedom?"" asked one social media user.The new generation powering China´s protestsMr Xi appeared to refer obliquely to the protests in his New Year´s address, saying it was natural in such a big country for people to have different opinions.But he urged people to come together and show unity as China entered a ""new phase"" in its approach to Covid.The Chinese authorities are aware of the widespread scepticism although they continue to play down the severity of this wave of Covid sweeping the country. In an interview with state TV, the director of Beijing´s Institute of Respiratory Diseases admitted the number of deaths of elderly people so far this winter was ""definitely more"" than in past years, while also stressing that critical cases remained a minority of the overall number of Covid cases.This week the People´s Daily, the Communist Party´s official newspaper, urged citizens to work towards a ""final victory"" over Covid and dismissed criticism of the previous zero-Covid policy.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: Ros Atkins on...

How US Marines are being reshaped for China threat - BBC News,"How US Marines are being reshaped for China threat - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeWar in UkraineCoronavirusClimateVideoWorldUKBusinessTechScienceMoreStoriesEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsWorldAfricaAsiaAustraliaEuropeLatin AmericaMiddle EastUS & CanadaHow US Marines are being reshaped for China threatPublished1 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Iwo Jima Memorial in Washington DCThe US military commitment to the Pacific was underlined in a White House meeting between the leaders of the US and Japan. But behind the scenes, this renewed focus on Asia has sparked a fierce debate within one of its most fabled military forces, writes defence analyst Jonathan Marcus.A bitter family row has erupted in one of the US military´s most hallowed institutions, the US Marine Corps.A host of its former senior commanders are lining up to attack the current leadership over plans for its reinvention.At issue is a plan to adapt the service for a potential conflict against China - a plan dubbed Force Design 2030. Almost from its inception this plan has been under attack with a cohort of retired generals taking the unusual approach of going to the press to air their frustrations.Retired senior officers have been meeting regularly; speaking at seminars and think tanks; and devising their own alternative to a plan which they see as a disaster for the Marine Corps´ future. One prominent critic is the former US Navy Secretary and former Senator for Virginia, Jim Webb, who served as a Marine officer in the Vietnam War and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2015. Space Force opens first overseas base in S KoreaUS unveils new nuclear stealth bomberWriting in the Wall Street Journal, he described Force Design 2030 as ""insufficiently tested"" and ""intrinsically flawed"". He warned that the plan ""raised serious questions about the wisdom and long-term risk of dramatic reductions in force structure, weapons systems and manpower levels in units that would take steady casualties in most combat scenarios"".So what has got them all so upset? Launched in 2020 by the Marine Corps Commandant General David H Berger, the plan is intended to equip the Marines for a potential conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific region rather than counter-insurgency wars like Iraq and Afghanistan.The new plan sees the Marines as fighting dispersed operations across chains of islands. Units will be smaller, more spread out, but packing a much bigger punch through a variety of new weapons systems. Huge amphibious landings like in World War Two or massive deployments on land - like in Iraq - will probably be things of the past.Most unpopular is the plan to cut back on foot soldiers and give up all its tanks. Such proposals have led some critics to feel the Corps is turning its back on its past. While it has close ties with the US Navy it is a separate service which grew dramatically in World War Two and has taken a prominent role in recent campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Public perceptions of the Marine Corps are powerfully influenced by the World War Two experience. Anyone who has seen John Wayne in the 1949 feature film The Sands of Iwo Jima or the more recent mini-series The Pacific produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks will remember the large-scale amphibious operations; men storming ashore from landing craft and so on. Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Scene from The Pacific mini-seriesThis is not the way the new plan sees the Marines as fighting.Its traditional role as America´s military first responder, capable of taking on disparate challenges around the globe, is what critics believe could be compromised by the new plan with its clear focus upon China and the Indo-Pacific.So what exactly is in the plan?some infantry battalions - the foot soldiers - to be cut around three-quarters of its towed artillery batteries replaced by long-range rocket systemsseveral helicopter squadrons are being cutgiving up all of its tanksMoney for the new weapons systems, totalling $15.8 billion,  are to be funded by the cuts which amount to some  $18.2 billion.In addition to the new rocket artillery systems, there are to be new anti-shipping missiles that can be fired from land and new unmanned aerial systems. The goal is to equip and train the Marine Corps for a new kind of warfare that the fighting in Ukraine has already prefigured.  The primary guiding factor of Force Design 2030 is what the Marines´ Commandant refers to as distributed operations, breaking up large forces into widely distributed smaller units but ensuring that they have sufficient military punch to make a real difference. These principles are already being put into practice on Japan´s Okinawa islands near Taiwan, where the Marines stationed there will undergo a shake-up, according to US officials.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida meets US President Joe BidenMilitary specialist Mike O´Hanlon, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, rejects the central criticism that the new focus on China might impair Marine operations elsewhere. The Marines will go where they are ordered, he says, and the new strategy probably won´t impact on operations as much as some think. ""What really has mattered in this regard is the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years - THAT is the big change, irrespective of (and mostly before) General Berger´s vision was even developed.""Many commentators insist that change is essential if the Marines are to face up to the challenges of the modern battlefield. Dr Frank Hoffman - himself a former Marine officer - is now a Distinguished Research Fellow at the US National Defense University. ""I think the critics are looking backwards to a gloried past, and fail to see the strategic picture vis a vis China and technology in a really disappointing way,"" he says. Orphaned choirboy ended up a US naval hero´My father kept me a secret for 60 years´While the withdrawal of the Marines´ tanks has drawn particular criticism, Dr Hoffman believes it is the right course. There will still be plenty of armoured vehicles, he argues, just not ""the heavy tanks and their supporting cast of refuellers"". ""It´s an adaptation to cover a deeper area with a more accurate mix of firepower such as we are seeing in Ukraine. The Corps has used its aviation element to have this range in the past, and now it will have a mix of traditional artillery and a family of missiles that will increase the lethality and range of its fire support."" These are all steps that many would say are justified by the lessons from Ukraine.The utility and importance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); rocket artillery; and the ability to strike at great range with great accuracy have all been underlined in the Russia-Ukraine war and are very much part of the Marines´ new plans. But their envisaged battlefield is very different - not the forests and steppe lands of Ukraine but island chains reaching across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.Force Design 2030 is very much an evolving programme. There have already been changes and there will be more. And while the direction of travel has been established there are still huge problems to resolve, not least the logistical challenges posed by a force likely to be distributed over a vast area.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, US Marine Osprey lands in joint exercise with Japan in GotembaAmphibious shipping will play a key role here. And as Nick Childs, the Senior Fellow for Naval Forces and Maritime Security at the IISS in London explains, new kinds of ships are going to be needed. ""Just relying on their traditional large amphibious ships would leave them too vulnerable to the kinds of modern weaponry that they are likely to face"", he says. ""So new kinds of smaller ships in greater numbers will be vital, so that the Marine Corps can operate in a more agile and dispersed way.""But getting more ships is not going to be easy. Smaller ones can be built quickly and in a wide range of shipyards but not necessarily at the pace needed. The US Navy also needs significant numbers of new warships and it is far from clear that there are the funds or the ship-yard capacity needed. It´s the age-old problem of matching strategic priorities to resources. And the crisis in Ukraine underlines that old threats can reappear just as a force is trying to focus itself in an entirely new direction.Jonathan Marcus is an honorary professor at the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter, UKRelated TopicsChinaJapanUS Armed ForcesUnited StatesTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

They will be the first Marvel films to play in Chinese theatres since Spider-Man: Far from Home in July 2019.Chinese officials have never explained why Marvel movies were blocked from screening in the country.But the apparent ban began at a time when tensions between the US and China reached a high amid a trade war.There was also no reason given by Marvel for the turnaround, in its brief announcement on Chinese social media network Weibo on Wednesday about the film release dates.But it still drew jubilant reactions from movie lovers.

A division of the Chinese Communist Party´s propaganda department, the China Film Administration, decides if a foreign movie can be released in the country.

We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,"" said Pentagon press secretary Brig Gen Patrick Ryder. He provided no further details about the balloon´s location.Mr Blinken described the Chinese balloon over the US as ""a violation of our sovereignty"".""This is an unacceptable as well as an irresponsible action,"" he said. ""It´s even more irresponsible coming on the eve of a long-planned visit.""America´s top diplomat was set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. But on Thursday US defence officials announced they were tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the United States. High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?While the balloon was, the Pentagon said, ""travelling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic"" and did ""not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground"", its presence sparked outrage.On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying that it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.A statement from China´s Foreign Ministry said that it regretted the incident and would work with the US to resolve the issue.However, the state department official said that while the US acknowledged China´s claim about the balloon´s purpose, it stood by the assessment that it was being used for surveillance. Another trip by Mr Blinken to China would be planned ""at the earliest opportunity"", another senior state department official said, adding that Washington planned to maintain ""open lines of communication"" about the incident. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Anthony Blinken was expected in China on 5 and 6 FebruaryThe official added that the state department had informed close US allies about the violation of US airspace.  In a statement, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada - the country´s foreign ministry - said that it had summoned China´s ambassador over the incident and would ""vigorously express"" its position to Chinese officials. A White House spokesperson said that US President Joe Biden agreed with Mr Blinken that it was ""not appropriate"" to go to China at this time. Mr Biden did not take questions about the balloon following remarks about the US economy on Friday morning.

By Friday morning, the balloon was moving east ""over the centre of the continental US"" at an altitude of about 60,000ft (18,200m) according to Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder. Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said on Twitter that the balloon was over the north-eastern part of his state early on Friday afternoon.  Gen Ryder added that US officials are monitoring the object and reviewing ""options"". He said the balloon - which he described as ""manoeuvrable"" - posed no military or physical threat to people on the ground. Although fighter planes were alerted, the US decided not to shoot the object down due to the dangers of falling debris, officials said. The Democratic president´s political opponents demanded tough action against China. Several Republican lawmakers - as well as former President Donald Trump - have urged the US to down the alleged spy craft. ""Shoot down the balloon,"" Mr Trump said in a short message on his Truth Social social media platform. On Twitter, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the balloon incident was ""a destabilizing action that must be addressed"". The Biden administration must now contend with China ""hawks"" on both sides of the political spectrum. Montana Democratic Senator Jon Tester said in a statement that he was ""still waiting on real answers"". Speaking to CBS, a US official described the payload of the balloon - the attached part from which the alleged surveillance is carried out - as being as large as two or three school buses. The balloon itself is significantly larger. Chinese officials have previously publicly expressed interest in the potential military and intelligence-gathering potential of balloons. ""Technological advances have opened a new door for the use of balloons,"" an article in the military-run Liberation Army Daily said last year. In 2022, Taiwan´s defence ministry said it had detected Chinese balloons over its territory.

Taiwan´s foreign minister Joseph Wu condemned China´s action then as highly provocative. China has never said it would not use force to bring Taiwan under its control.On Monday, Taiwan´s defence ministry said 43 Chinese aircraft had crossed over the so-called median line, an unofficial buffer separating the two sides inside the air defence zone.China said it had conducted ""strike drills"" around Taiwan on Sunday in response to what it said was provocation from the island and the US. A White House National Security Council official said the US was concerned by the latest development, adding it would ""continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability in line with our long-standing commitments and consistent with our one-China policy"".Washington has always walked a diplomatic tightrope over the issue of Taiwan.On the one hand it adheres to the one-China policy, a cornerstone of its relationship with Beijing. Under this policy, the US acknowledges that there is only one Chinese government, and has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan.But it also maintains close relations with Taiwan and sells arms to it under the Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself.Related TopicsChinaTaiwan",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64094261,26,12,2022

He said details of the agency´s investigation were classified but the FBI had a team of experts focusing on the dangers of biological threats.In response, Beijing accused Washington of ""political manipulation"".""The conclusions they have reached have no credibility to speak of,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city´s seafood and wildlife market.The market is near a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.A few days ago, the US Department of Energy said it had found the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan but could only reach that conclusion with ""low confidence"".In response to that, many scientists who have studied the virus said this week that there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at University of Glasgow.""There´s been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,"" he said.On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden supports ""a whole-of-government effort"" to discover how Covid began.""We´re just not there [at consensus] yet,"" he said. ""If we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress, we will do that.""Tensions in bilateral ties between the US and China have spiked in the wake of the recent spy balloon saga.A bipartisan panel of US lawmakers this week kicked off a series of hearings on the ""existential"" threat of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.The first session of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party focused on issues such as human rights and the US economy´s dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

Brewdog Shanghai, which opened in 2020, is in the Jing´An district of the city.The Scotland-headquartered firm employs more than 2,300 people and also has breweries in the US state of Ohio, Berlin in Germany and Brisbane in Australia.The company reportedly planned to start selling shares on the London stock market in 2020 but postponed the move as the pandemic saw pubs and bars closed during lockdowns.Mr Watt has said Brewdog has no plans to imminently revive a share sale but has hinted that one could take place by the end of this year.According to Brewdog´s 2021 financial results, it saw an annual operating loss of £5.5m ($6.6m).The company has faced criticism for its marketing campaigns, as well as its workplace culture.In January this year, Mr Watt said he had paid out almost £500,000 to winners of the company´s misleading ""solid gold"" beer can promotion.Some winners questioned the worth of the cans and complained after discovering they were gold-plated.Separately, a letter from ex-workers in June 2021 stated former staff had ""suffered mental illness"" as a result of working for the brewer.It made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.Mr Watt apologised to former staff and said their complaints would help make him a better chief executive.Related TopicsBrewDogBeer",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64700857,20,02,2023

It will also acquire the ability to strike enemy bases.The changes mark the most dramatic overhaul to Japan´s security strategy since it adopted a pacifist constitution after World War Two. Under the plan, Tokyo will buy US long-range missiles capable of destroying enemy launch sites if it is attacked. It will also increase its cyber warfare capabilities. Earlier this week, Beijing urged Tokyo to view their relationship as a cooperative partnership.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told journalists Japan´s defence budget would be 2% of GDP by 2027.""Unfortunately in the vicinity of our country, there are countries carrying out activities such as enhancement of nuclear capability, a rapid military build-up and unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force,"" he said. ""These are also now becoming more outstanding. In the next five years, in order to fundamentally reinforce our defence capabilities we will implement a defence build-up programme worth 43 trillion yen ($314bn; £257bn).""A national security strategy document approved by the cabinet and quoted by AFP news agency described China as ""the greatest strategic challenge ever to securing the peace and stability of Japan"".It also noted that China had not ruled out the use of force to assert control over Taiwan.China´s embassy in Japan responded by accusing Tokyo of making false claims about its military activities.There are also concerns in Japan about North Korea´s missile capability. Pyongyang has fired more than 50 missiles over the past three months, including a ballistic missile over Japan in October - the first time for five years.Meanwhile the Japanese document described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a ""serious violation of laws that forbid the use of force"" which had ""shaken the foundations of the international order"".Will Ukraine invasion push Japan to go nuclear?A previous national security document in 2013 described China and Russia as strategic partners.Japan´s post-war constitution does not officially recognise the military and limits it to self-defence capabilities, though former prime minister Shinzo Abe expanded its role in 2015.Polls suggest public opinion in Japan now broadly supports some form of further military expansion.Mr Kishida´s 2% of GDP figure coincides with a long-term target set by Japan´s allies in the Western Nato military alliance in 2006.While many Nato countries are still short of the target, Germany hopes to reach it in the next few years. The UK has surpassed it and is aiming to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2030.Related TopicsChinaJapanMilitaryNorth Korea",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64001554,16,12,2022

China has repeatedly insisted that the ""airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident"".On Tuesday, US officials said the Pentagon sought to arrange a phone call between Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart after the balloon was shot down, but was rebuffed by China. ""Lines between our militaries are particularly important in moments like this,"" defence press secretary Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, the PRC has declined our request.""The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off a weekend trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years - over the ""irresponsible act"". Image source, US Fleet Forces CommandThe balloon was retrieved off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a day after being shot down by a fighter jet.The navy said the debris was spread over seven miles (11km) of the Atlantic Ocean, and two naval ships - including one with a heavy crane for recovery - were sent to the area. However, the photos reveal the piles of balloon material were able to be pulled aboard by hand.The US military has also deployed unmanned underwater vehicles as part of the search effort. What can US learn from Chinese balloon debris?Experts say that the wreckage of the balloon could provide the US with valuable insight into Chinese aerial surveillance technology and techniques, allowing them to better understand what the balloon was capable of and how it transmitted information. Efforts to recover the balloon´s equipment, however, have been complicated by the need to ensure that US personnel are kept safe from potentially dangerous materials, such as explosives or battery components. US defence officials first announced they were tracking the strange object on Thursday, and waited until it was safely over water before shooting it down.Footage on US TV networks showed the balloon falling to the sea after a small explosion.On Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.Colombia´s Air Force says an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country´s airspace at above 55,000ft.It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Video appears to show China balloon shot downRelated TopicsSpyingChinaSurveillanceUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64562100,07,02,2023

India had relaxed its Covid rules, including mask-wearing, earlier this year after a drop in infection levels.The country witnessed two deadly waves in 2020 and 2022 - and the government had come under heavy criticism for its handling of the second wave in the summer of 2021 when thousands died amid a lack of oxygen supplies and critical medicines.At Thursday´s meeting, Mr Modi asked states to ensure operational readiness of hospital infrastructure, including a healthy supply of oxygen cylinders and ventilators.While there was no reason to panic, the prime minister cautioned against complacency and urged citizens to take all necessary precautions. According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases, but reports of the surge in China have created a sense of fear among many people. Over the past few months, India has reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7, the Omicron subvariant linked to a spike in cases in China. The cases - three in Gujarat state and one in Odisha - were detected in July, September and November and the patients have recovered, health officials have said.Several experts have said that India does not have reason to panic.In Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has assured the people that no case of the Covid variant has been detected in national capital.In the southern state of Karnataka, the government has made Covid tests mandatory for flu-like symptoms and said masks may soon be mandatory in closed spaces.Top health officials have asked people to get vaccinated and take booster doses. Over 2.2 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country, but only 27% of the population have taken the booster dose - which India calls a ""precaution dose"" - so far. The government said it had no plans yet to stop flights from countries where new cases were reported. But the country has resumed random testing of international travellers at the airports.On Thursday, India´s health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in parliament that though cases in China were rising, those in India were ""depleting"". He added that the ministry was closely monitoring new variants and advised states to increase genome sequencing.On Twitter, the government also debunked a fake message circulating on WhatsApp regarding a subvariant of the Omicron strain.Skip twitter post by Ministry of Health#FakeNewsThis message is circulating in some Whatsapp groups regarding XBB variant of #COVID19.The message is #FAKE and #MISLEADING. pic.twitter.com/LAgnaZjCCi— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) December 22, 2022

They will also name a new premier, the second-in-command after Mr Xi, as the incumbent Li Keqiang departs.The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.But this year´s sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions. They will also tighten control over bodies overseeing the finance sector and scientific and technology work, while ""strengthening party-building work"" in private businesses, according to state media.The moves will likely further blur the lines between the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and consolidate the party´s control of the private sector.This comes amid an ongoing corruption crackdown which has seen a string of high-profile businessmen disappear in recent years. The latest person to go missing was one of China´s top dealmakers in the tech sector.China´s Two Sessions: The basicsThe Two Sessions in Beijing are the annual meetings of China´s legislature and top political advisory body which attract thousands of representatives from across the countryThe National People´s Congress is the country´s equivalent of a parliament that is, in theory, the most powerful state organ. In reality it acts as a rubber-stamp body for the ruling Chinese Communist Party, passing key laws on decisions that have already been made The Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which has no real legislative power, draws its members from various sectors of society. Their debates are worth noting for emerging social and economic issuesThis week´s NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi´s leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party re-elected him as their leader for a third term. It was a break from decades-long tradition, as no other party leader besides Communist China´s first leader, Mao Zedong, will have served for this long. In the 2018 NPC meeting, lawmakers had approved the removal of term limits on the presidency, effectively allowing Mr Xi to remain leader for life.Mr Xi´s appointment comes as he faces domestic pressure to turn around an economy battered by his zero-Covid strategy and crackdowns in various business sectors.At the start of the meeting, it was announced that China will pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year, while defence spending is to rise by more than 7%.Abroad, Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.Xi Jinping´s power grab - and why it mattersXi´s path to a historic third term, explainedXi Jinping´s party is just getting startedThe NPC will also unveil the new Premier, China´s equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi´s most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. As the Shanghai party secretary, he oversaw a prolonged and painful Covid lockdown that angered locals and made international headlines. Outgoing premier Li Keqiang, who was ousted in the leadership reshuffle at October´s party congress, will deliver his last work report speech. The political appointments for the rest of the Politburo Standing Committee, the equivalent of Mr Xi´s cabinet, will also be announced.Many will be watching to see who fills several key positions, such as the commerce minister, head of the national development and reform commission, propaganda chief, and head of state security.Observers say the team was picked more for their loyalty to Mr Xi and the party, rather than for their expertise.Who are the men who rule China now?Related TopicsXi JinpingAsiaChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64819857,05,03,2023

England - outside the EU - is asking for pre-departure tests for Chinese arrivals from ThursdayBy Kathryn ArmstrongBBC NewsEuropean Union officials are ""strongly"" recommending that all member states insist on negative Covid tests from Chinese arrivals before they travel.Travel in and out of China gets easier from Sunday, as part of the scrapping of the ""zero-Covid"" policy.China is currently seeing a surge in Covid cases, with reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed.Some EU countries have already introduced testing - despite earlier advice that it was ""unjustified"". China under-representing Covid deaths, WHO warnsWednesday´s recommendation on negative tests came from the EU´s Integrated Political Crisis Response group (IPCR), a body made up of officials from the EU´s 27 governments.It also advised that:All passengers on flights to and from China wear face masksRandom testing of flights from China be introduced, andWastewater monitoring be conducted at airports.The recommendation comes a day after the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said an ""overwhelming"" number of member states favoured restrictions on Chinese arrivals.France, Spain and Italy have already introduced testing - but others, such as Germany, had been monitoring the situation. England, outside the EU, requires pre-flight testing on China arrivals from Thursday.Despite the recommendation, it´s not known if an EU-wide policy will be introduced - but individual states can set their own policy.The advice from the IPCR is a change in tack from the body´s disease prevention agency, which last week advised against the introduction of mandatory Covid tests.The ECDC said testing was ""unjustified"", given the high rates of vaccination in Europe, and that variants circulating in China were already in the European Union.The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday said there was no evidence of new variants in China, despite the surge in cases. However, experts warned this could be due to a lack of testing and data. The WHO has also said that China was under-representing the true impact of Covid in the country - in part due to what they said was a ""too narrow"" definition of a Covid death. Beijing has confirmed only 22 deaths since December, which is at odds with data from analysts. The UK science data company Airfinity estimates there are more than two million Covid cases a day in China, and 14,700 deaths.The Chinese government suggested earlier this week that travel restrictions on Chinese arrivals are politically motivated - and has warned that it may retaliate.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus testingEuropean UnionCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64167061,04,01,2023

Confirmation of his third term as president had been widely expected. The naming of a new premier and various ministers in the coming days is considered more important.The new appointees are mostly expected to be Xi Jinping loyalists. This includes Li Qiang, who is tipped to serve as Mr Xi´s number two.On Friday, Mr Xi has also gained another term as the chairman of the CMC of the People´s Republic of China. There are two CMCs in the country - one is a party organisation while another is a state institution - but their make-up is usually the same. Mr Xi has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests. The country is also facing a falling birth rate that threatens its economic growth engine.Ties between Beijing and Washington remain testy, recently highlighted by allegations China had been spying on the US with balloons.""Whether a strengthened Xi and increasing centralisation is sufficient to overcome these problems - or perhaps make them worse - is unknown and perhaps not knowable at present,"" Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University Singapore, told the BBC.""In a sense, Xi is betting that centralisation under the party with him at the helm is a solution to these disparate issues,"" he said.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: Why China´s president gets two teacups...in 59 secondsThe so-called Two Sessions of the National People´s Congress and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into China´s direction in the coming years.Since Mao Zedong, leaders in China had been limited to two terms in office. When Mr Xi had this restriction changed in 2018, it transformed him into a figure with a reach not seen since Chairman Mao.Also on Friday, the national legislature appointed Han Zheng, a 68-year-old former Politburo Standing Committee member, as vice president.The importance of the position varies since its functions are not fully defined. However, the last vice president, Wang Qishan, fronted Mr Xi´s anti-corruption campaign, Chong said.Chances are that Mr Han will follow Mr Xi´s direction closely and enforce the president´s policies as necessary, he added.Related TopicsXi JinpingAsiaChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64911512,10,03,2023
Tense US-China meeting deepens balloon row - BBC News,"Tense US-China meeting deepens balloon row - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeWar in UkraineCoronavirusClimateVideoWorldUKBusinessTechScienceMoreStoriesEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsAsiaChinaIndiaTense US-China meeting deepens balloon rowPublished19 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Biden said he would ""make no apologies"" for shooting down the balloonBy Tessa WongBBC News, Asia Digital ReporterAs the rift between the US and China over the balloon saga widens, so has the divide within the global community scrutinising their high-stakes dispute.The latest testy exchange took place on Saturday, when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met China´s top diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, in the first high-level meeting since the row began.Mr Blinken said they would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"".China continues to deny that they sent a spy balloon, even as the US continues to disclose more details of the object to back up their allegation. But beyond the dispute, the way both Beijing and Washington have responded to each other has come under close examination as the world grapples with the incident´s implications for national security and geopolitical stability.The net result, say observers, is that it has hardened positions - deepening distrust among those wary of China or the US - and made it significantly harder for Washington and Beijing to close the gap between them.How has China reacted to the balloon saga?Balloon saga deflates efforts to mend US-China relationsFor some, the incident has heightened anxieties over the reach of Chinese espionage, as governments scramble to reassess what they know of China´s surveillance capabilities. The US claims Chinese military balloons have crossed the airspace of more than 40 countries across five continents.This week Japan - a key US ally - announced that after they had re-analysed past cases of unidentified flying objects, they ""strongly suspect"" that China had flown at least three spy balloons across their territory since 2019.A Financial Times report quoted unnamed Taiwanese officials saying the island - another US ally, and one that is claimed by China - had been spied on by dozens of Chinese military balloons. Taiwan´s defence ministry later clarified it had only spotted Chinese weather balloons - on Friday it found the remnants of one such object - but also warned they would not hesitate to shoot down any suspected military objects in its airspace. ""For other states, they didn´t know what to make of it previously, but now they do. So it shows a gap in understanding on the part of other states, and not surprisingly China has sought to exploit the gap,"" said Dr Ian Chong, a non-resident scholar at Carnegie China.For those convinced of the US allegations, the incident has highlighted an underestimation of China´s surveillance capability - and the lengths Beijing would go to prove it. ""It certainly indicates the People´s Liberation Army feels they can justify absolutely any technology and any mission, that they can do anything to increase China´s ability to project power, conduct surveillance, and hold the US at risk,"" said Mr Drew Thompson, a former US Department of Defense official and a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore.This, said Mr Thompson, was done ""regardless of the consequences to China´s reputation, its obligation and adherence to international law, and without considering the benefits of acting with restraint"".Noting there has been a lack of a concerted outcry and pushback from the global community, Mr Thompson said this demonstrated ""a fragility of international law"" and was a ""testament to China´s ability to deter other countries from criticising them"", and could lead to a more unsafe world.Beijing undermined its own attempts to win trust and project the image of a responsible superpower with the way it has responded in the saga, according to some observers.China has yet to divulge details backing up its claim that the balloon was a civilian meteorological airship, such as the name of the company that operated it. ""This lack of transparency has only created more questions, and has given those who are already sceptical a reason to be even more so,"" said Dr Chong.Beijing´s subsequent claim that the US has in the past flown more than 10 spy balloons into China - which Washington has denied - was also ""confusing"", he added.""Is China suggesting that floating lots of balloons over each other´s territory has been an accepted practice?"" asked Dr Chong, who pointed out that if this were the case, it would contradict Beijing´s long-held insistence on the respect for sovereignty.The claim could be seen as a case of China deflecting and engaging in ""whataboutism"", said Mr Thompson, which is a way of responding to an accusation by proffering a counter-accusation.But the way the US has reacted has also unnerved some, particularly those who side with China.This week, US officials admitted that three other objects they shot out of the sky in North America were not likely foreign spy crafts. US President Joe Biden defended the decision as necessary to protect commercial air traffic, and also because at that time they ""could not rule out the surveillance risk of sensitive facilities"".Victor Gao, vice-president of Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization, called the shootings an ""overreaction"" that could be seen as the US ""acting increasingly hysterical"". ""China has been very professional and responsible, explaining the situation to the US and the whole world and asking for co-operation rather than confrontation. This is in contrast to the jingoism of the US - they should remember they are not shooting buffalo in the Wild West, they are shooting down an object that China owns,"" he said.Others have praised the US´ handling of the incident, with Australia´s deputy PM Richard Marles calling the shootdown of the Chinese balloon ""a very measured way"" of responding to the incursion.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Happier times: Mr Xi and Mr Biden greeted each other warmly at the G20 summit in Bali in NovemberWith both sides doubling down, what is clear is that the balloon blow-up has made reconciliation even harder.For the Chinese, the shootdown and Mr Biden´s refusal to apologise has set a precedent, warned Mr Gao.""They would need to be prepared for similar acts of retaliation against similar objects in Chinese space… Don´t complain that China doesn´t apologise, if such an unfortunate incident happens again,"" he said.He pointed out that it may even push China to take a stronger stance against US planes and ships in airspace and waters which China considers as theirs, such as Taiwan. The US Navy routinely conducts what it calls ""freedom of navigation"" exercises by sailing its military ships through the Taiwan Strait.But there are signs of a willingness to engage. Mr Biden said he plans on calling Chinese president Xi Jinping soon to discuss the incident.Both leaders face domestic pressure to not be seen as backing down. As the balloon saga drifts on, the question now is how much political capital both leaders would be willing to spend to deflate tensions.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsRelated TopicsChinaUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64673926,19,02,2023

""When people feel sick they all go to hospitals, which may easily crash the healthcare system.""How is China tackling Covid? Pitfalls lie ahead as China exits zero-CovidChinese pour hearts out on hero doctor´s pageA rush on pharmacies has led to significant nationwide shortages of medicine used to treat a cold or the flu. Home testing kits for Covid are also hard to come by.In Beijing, though restaurants are allowed to open again, they have very few customers and the streets are quiet.Companies are telling employees they should return to the office, but many don´t want to.This all makes sense when you consider that, just weeks ago, the government was saying that there will be no swerving from zero-Covid, that those infected must go to centralised quarantine facilities and that lockdowns were necessary.Image caption, The queue outside a hospital´s fever clinic in Beijing on MondayThe coronavirus was something to fear and Chinese people were lucky to live here because the Communist Party would not sacrifice them on the altar of opening up.Now the goal of returning each outbreak to zero cases has been abandoned, Covid is spreading like wildfire and the line from the government is that catching this disease is not something to worry about.China´s easing of Covid restrictions was expected to unfold more slowly, much more gradually.Then came street protests, in city after city, with demonstrators demanding their old lives back. They wanted to be free to move around again. There were clashes with police and the chant was going up for China´s leader Xi Jinping to resign and for the Communist Party to give up power.This was the straw that broke zero-Covid´s back.Image caption, An empty shopping street in Beijing this weekAccording to Prof Chen, this meant that the timing of China´s re-opening was ""not ideal"" but they had to do it.He said countries like Singapore and New Zealand made their changes when infections were at bay. However, China has moved with full-blown outbreaks under way in cities like Beijing.The government ""heard the voice of the protesters"", he said, but added that this was not the ideal choice for them in terms of timing.So the protesters may have won, but the speed of the cave-in from the government has left elderly people afraid to leave their homes.One woman we met going for a walk with her grandson said she would stay clear of crowded places, that she would keep wearing a mask and continue to wash her hands regularly.Yet a reluctance to be in places where infection is more likely permeates all groups in society. The impact on Beijing has been great.Another reason restaurants are empty is that the city government still requires a negative PCR test result within 48 hours to dine inside. However, the majority of results are not coming through to health code phone apps. Image caption, Delivery services of food and groceries are still seeing high demand as Beijing residents remain cautious on venturing outsideThis seems to be because the labs have been swamped with work now that Covid is spreading so rapidly.A 34-year-old woman, who is isolating at home after catching Covid, told the BBC that the experience, so far, has been surprisingly smooth.She said her symptoms have not been as bad as she had expected them to be and that she has everything she needs.She also said she was much happier to have the option of recovering at home with her husband rather than in a crowded quarantine centre.However, she too worries. She has a sister with young children, parents living alone in their hometown and a grandmother who all have to get through this period.Doctors are taking to social media in an attempt reassure people that it is fine for them to remain at home after they catch Covid.Officials have also started to transform China´s Covid isolation centres into temporary hospital facilities, to cope with an explosion of infections. In just one day this week, 22,000 people in Beijing tried to get into a fever clinic.Questions are being asked. Why didn´t the government prepare for this earlier, with an expansion of hospital ICU capacity?Why has it taken so long to make this switch when countries around the world had already done it?Why did Xi Jinping´s administration allow the zero-Covid approach to cause so much damage to the economy more broadly and people´s livelihoods more specifically?A renewed vaccination push has started but it too should have come before China reached this stage.The government says it is the virus which has changed, that newer strains are less dangerous and that this has meant the time was right to alter the response.Either way, there is much more optimism now.A group of overseas Chinese have set up a special chat on the Wechat app so that people living in other countries can share their experiences of having Covid with users in China.The goal is simple. Calm nerves. For sure, the next couple of months are going to be tough here. Millions of people are going to get sick and there will be many deaths.However, the old approach was clearly unsustainable and, at last, people can see a way out.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-63944861,14,12,2022

US and Canadian officials have not yet located or recovered any wreckage from the three downed aircraft. Beijing earlier accused the US of ""a trigger-happy overreaction"".China has denied one of its balloons, which was destroyed by a US fighter jet earlier this month off South Carolina, was being used for espionage, saying it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown off course.How has China reacted to the balloon saga?At Tuesday´s daily news conference, Mr Kirby said it will be difficult to determine the purpose or origin of the three other objects that were destroyed over Alaska, Canada and Michigan until the debris is found and analysed.""We haven´t seen any indication or anything that points specifically to the idea that these three objects were part of the PRC´s [People´s Republic of China] spying programme,"" the White House National Security Council told reporters, ""or that they were definitively involved in external intelligence collection efforts"".A ""leading explanation"" being considered by US intelligence, he added, was that ""these could be balloons that were simply tied to commercial or research entities and therefore benign"".But he noted that no company, organisation or government had yet laid claim to the objects.In the most recent strike - over Lake Huron - the first Sidewinder missile fired by a US F-16 warplane missed its target, the top US general has confirmed.""First shot missed.

Shortly after take-off the balloon drifted towards the US islands of Guam and Hawaii before moving north towards Alaska, American officials told CBS News, the BBC´s partner.The unnamed officials say that its path indicates that it could have been blown off course by weather, but that it was back under the Chinese control again by the time it reached the continental US.

The Daily Mail says Rishi Sunak is under growing pressure to take a harder line on China, with Conservative MPs saying he should formally designate Beijing a ""threat"".The ´i´ says the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, says the row is leading to calls to increase defence spending.  Former military leaders are quoted saying a failure to do so would also embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin.The Times reports that the RAF will examine intelligence gathered by the US military - to see if it can improve its quick reaction force.According to the Daily Telegraph, the use of Chinese-made drones by British police forces has provoked security fears within the government.  The paper says more than two-thirds of the drones are made by a Chinese firm that is blacklisted in the US.  The Telegraph´s leader column questions whether adequate safeguards are in place.The Daily Star picks up on the admission by a US Air Force general that he was not ruling out aliens.  Its front page depicts ET.  Its editorial describes the comment as a ""major step forward in our dealings with the extra-terrestrial"".There is dismay in the Express that millions of households face the maximum possible council tax increase.  The paper says it is a further blow to those already hit hard by higher bills. Its editorial acknowledges that councils´ budgetary pressures are down to funding shortfalls - but argues that spendthrift authorities are culpable too. The online-only Independent has an article by a former CBI President who declares Labour to be the party of business.  It says Paul Drechsler, who was also an adviser to David Cameron, ""showers praise"" on the party - something it describes as a ""hammer blow"" for the Tories. The Guardian leads on the former Metropolitan police officer, Wayne Couzens, pleading guilty to charges of indecent exposure.  The offences happened days before he kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everard.  The paper says detectives missed ""clear chances"" to identify him as a potential sex offender.Image source, Getty ImagesOn its front page, the Times reports that water companies privately lobbied to weaken the government´s tougher sewage rules. It suggests that they argued the £56bn plan - to reduce sewage spills from storm overflows - risked adding hundreds of pounds to household bills. It quotes various objections the companies raised, such as opinion polls indicating that inflation was a greater concern for the public than the environment. The paper´s editorial argues that if Britain is to enjoy the levels of water quality that many other European countries take for granted, then customer bills must be permitted to rise. And finally, the Telegraph suggests that a new Brexit deal could be announced within a fortnight.  It has been told by sources in both Brussels and London that a pact has been thrashed out. The paper suggests progress has been made because ""the UK watered down its hard-line resistance to European judges ruling on issues in Northern Ireland"".  Downing Street, it says, has stressed that elements of an agreement are ""still moving"" - but did not deny that an announcement was expected soon.THE GOLD: Nail-biting drama based on the audacious Brink´s-Mat heistLIFE-CHANGING DECLUTTERING: Stacey Solomon helps families transform their homesRelated Internet LinksDaily ExpressDaily MailDaily MirrorDaily StarDaily TelegraphFinancial TimesGuardianIndependentMetroMorning StarSunTimesThe iBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

This is similar to the UK and the US, but Japan is also restricting flights from China to certain Japanese cities.Beijing´s embassies in both Seoul and Tokyo confirmed the new visa restrictions for visitors to China.China reopened its borders on Sunday for the first time since March 2020 as part of scrapping of its ""zero-Covid"" policy. Reacting to China´s latest visa restrictions, South Korea´s foreign ministry told the BBC that its policy towards arrivals from China was ""in accordance with scientific and objective evidence"". According to South Korea´s Disease Control and Prevention Agency, around a third of all arrivals from China tested positive for Covid prior to the visa restrictions being put in place. Nearly everyone in China province got Covid - officialCelebrity deaths spark fears over China Covid tollAt Seoul´s Incheon International airport - the only South Korean airport still allowing flights from China - arrivals are met by military personnel in personal protective equipment. The BBC managed to speak to some of them as they were escorted to the airport testing centre. ""Personally, I think it´s OK. I have been through much worse during this pandemic,"" said William, a businessman from Shanghai. ""As a traveller I just try to comply with the policies are much as possible.""But another passenger disagreed. ""In my mind it´s not scientific at all,"" said Emily, who arrived from Hong Kong. She, like those coming from mainland China, was required to test. ""I feel like it´s a little bit unfair on this side. They must feel really unsafe, I suppose.""Many South Koreans support the idea of protecting their country from China´s coronavirus surge - but not all are convinced that the decision is a purely medical one.""There is a political element to it and the relationship between the two countries isn´t a good one. A lot of Korean people hold a lot of animosity blaming China for the coronavirus,"" said Jinsun, who was heading to Abu Dhabi.EU ´strongly´ urges Covid testing for China travelAnother woman going on her honeymoon to Paris said South Korea might not have implemented such rules if the country concerned wasn´t China. ""But then again, whatever we did, China would have a problem with it,"" she said.The South Korean curbs are supposed to last at least until the end of the month, which would give scientists time to analyse for any potential new variants coming from China. ""There´s no transparency at the moment in China about any monitoring for new variants. If a new variant comes from China, it would be a very difficult situation for the whole world,"" Professor Kim Woo Joo, an infectious diseases expert at Korea University and a government adviser, told the BBC.""It would also be a disaster for the Korean healthcare system. We currently have a lot of hospitalisations and deaths already and our elderly people are also under-vaccinated. This is what we are worried about.""At the moment, only a small number of business or diplomatic travellers from China are being allowed into South Korea. They must test negative before departure and also on arrival. One Chinese man who tested positive escaped from a bus taking him to a quarantine hotel near the airport. Two days later he was caught by police in a hotel in Seoul.Related TopicsChinaSouth KoreaCoronavirus pandemicTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

Products for home remedies are now largely unavailable online, including lemons and canned peaches rich in vitamin C, and electrolysed water. Hoarding has been a common global issue but this may be the first instance of it after lockdowns were eased. In China, as elsewhere in the world, it has been common to see people sharing pictures online of bare grocery aisles in major cities ahead of strict ""stay at home"" orders being imposed.  But now the country has eased track-and-trace rules, and has allowed people to self-isolate at home and self-test for the virus, people appear to be panic-buying medicines in anticipation of a winter wave. Local governments have been urged to upgrade their ICU units and open fever clinics by the end of the month ""in preparation for waves of infection"".

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.End of twitter post by South China Morning PostChina Daily reports on how there has been an ""explosive growth in demand"" for pain-relief medicines, vitamins and cold/flu drugs.  Some outlets have shared pictures of empty pharmacy aisles, and media have been running stories throughout the week on how production lines at pharmaceutical firms are now working ""full capacity"" to deal with the surge of demand. The China Daily newspaper noted that panic-buying had been so rife that the government in the city of Guangzhou had called for ""sensible purchasing"".  ""There is no need for hoarding them in large quantities,"" it said in a statement. Guangzhou is the city that has seen the highest number of cases of the virus in recent weeks.  Last week, the Global Times newspaper also observed that the turnover for Covid-19 detection kits had increased more than 300% in line with China´s new eased Covid policies. It said that kits quickly became out of stock on leading platforms like JD Health.

""On some online shopping platforms, the demand for canned yellow peaches is rising so sharply that they are frequently labelled ´out of stock´,"" the newspaper says.

Some have even warned that excessively eating peaches could ""aggravate a cough"".  Other therapies have also quickly been tipped to follow suit in selling out online.  Pear Video observed a surge of people rushing to buy electrolyte water, after it was marketed as ""helpful with hydration after sweating or a fever"".    The Global Times also adds that that rumours have circulated online that ""drinking high quantities of alcohol"", can ""prevent"" or ""kill the virus"" and has warned people that there are only health dangers at doing so.China Covid: Hospitals under strain in wave of infectionsChina abandons key parts of zero-Covid strategy after protestsPapers are saturated with warnings from doctors at the moment against people ""blindly"" buying drugs, mixing medicines, or taking more than is necessary.

Is this a festive rabbit?"" said a user of messaging app WeChat.In the Chinese zodiac, 2023 is the Year of the Rabbit. ""Internet users say that the rabbit lantern at the square is too embarrassing.

Another WeChat user wrote: ""It looks like a rabbit goblin.""But some people said it wasn´t necessary to remove the lantern saying that it just looked like traditional ones.

It will not stop the rejuvenation of China,"" said Qin Gang. Mr Qin, China´s former ambassador to the US, held his first press conference as foreign minister on Tuesday.The spy balloon saga has heightened tensions between the superpowers despite recent efforts to improve ties. ""It [the US] regards China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong,"" said Mr Qin, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China´s parliament in Beijing. The foreign minister was responding to a question on whether a healthy China-US relationship was still possible as differences between the countries grew.The US called for establishing ""guardrails"", but what it really wants is for China to not hit back with words or actions when provoked, Mr Qin added. He was referring to US President Joe Biden´s comments last month that the US would ""compete fully with China but [is] not looking for conflict"". Biden makes no apologies for downing balloonMr Qin said: ""If the US does not put on the brakes and continues to roar down the wrong road, no amount of guardrails can stop the derailment and overturning, and it is bound to fall into conflict and confrontation. Who will bear its disastrous consequences?"" He also said the diplomatic crisis caused by the balloon incident could have been averted but the US acted with ""the presumption of guilt"". Washington has previously described the suspected spy balloon as a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"". Beijing admitted the object belonged to them, but said it was a civilian airship blown off-course. Spy Balloons: Are They Really A Threat?The BBC´s Gordon Corera breaks down what we know about spy balloonsWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)Relations between the two countries deteriorated during former US President Donald Trump´s administration, which launched a trade war against China in 2018. The two superpowers continue to clash on various issues, including Taiwan, China´s militarisation of the South China Sea and the origins of Covid.Mr Qin´s comments follow Chinese President Xi Jinping´s unusually direct rebuke of the US on Monday.Mr Xi said ""Western countries led by the US had implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression"" against China and that this brought ""severe challenges"" to the country.On Tuesday, Mr Qin said an ""invisible hand"" was driving the Ukraine crisis but did not name any country or individual. He reiterated that China had not provided weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine war and called for peace talks to resume.However, he asked: ""Why should the US demand that China refrain from supplying arms to Russia when it sells arms to Taiwan?""The Ukraine crisis has reached a ""critical juncture"", he said.""Either a ceasefire will stop the war, restore peace and embark on a political settlement, or fuel the fire, expand the crisis and drag it into the abyss of losing control.""Mr Qin, 56, was named China´s foreign minister in December 2022 and is one of the youngest appointees to this post in the country´s history. He replaced Wang Yi, who was promoted to the politburo of the ruling Communist Party in October that year.A trusted aide of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr Qin is well known as a tough-talking diplomat.

Washington´s diplomatic presence has until now largely been centred in its Papua New Guinea post.But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the Honiara embassy would help advance the US-Pacific partnership goals - signed last year - of keeping the region a place where ""democracy can flourish"".US secures Philippines deal to complete arc around ChinaIsland trip lays bare US-China tussle in the PacificThe embassy opening comes at ""an important moment for the region we share"", he said in a video statement.""Because more than any other part of the world - the Indo-Pacific region including the Pacific islands - will shape the world´s trajectory in the 21st Century.""Skip twitter post by USEmbassyPOMThe United States of America is pleased to announce the opening of its Embassy in Honiara.

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.End of twitter post by USEmbassyPOMConcerns about Beijing´s increasing influence and military expansion in the Pacific has prompted the US and Australia to step up their focus there in recent years.Last September, US President Joe Biden invited 14 Pacific island nations to the White House for the first-ever in-person summit. Washington signed a sweeping partnership and development agreement with the island nations.Solomon Islands PM Manasseh Sogavare also signed up to the deal despite reports in the lead-up that he might abstain.Beijing last year had also accelerated efforts to gain influence in the region - to mixed effect. While it inked a security deal with the Solomons in March, it failed to secure a trade and security deal with 10 regional countries a few months later despite a lobbying tour from China´s then Foreign Minister Wang Yi.""China has no intention of competing with anyone, let alone engaging in geopolitical competition, and has never established a so-called sphere of influence,"" said Mr Wang during the tour. In recent times, Fiji, one of the biggest and most influential Pacific islands, has also announced it will cancel a police training exchange with China - formerly a close partner.Fiji´s new government - elected in December - has indicated it prefers stronger ties with its traditional Pacific partners Australia and New Zealand over China.Australia and NZ are also both members of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) - the region´s main bloc. Several Pacific countries have advocated for regional unity in the face of superpower tensions and on Monday, many welcomed the announcement that Kiribati would return as a member.Kiribati had withdrawn from the PIF last year in a move the country´s opposition said had been influenced by Beijing. The country´s leader had then said the forum wasn´t adequately addressing the concerns of Micronesian countries.Dr Meg Keen from the Australia-based Lowy Institute said the US re-engagement was welcomed but it would remain to be seen ""if the announcements are backed up by actions"".She said the region could see a ""diverse range of partnerships"" as Pacific islands pursue development goals and funding.The new US embassy also comes as Washington has been re-negotiating agreements with three island nations in the North Pacific - Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands - who give exclusive military use rights to the US.Related TopicsChinaSolomon IslandsUnited StatesAustralia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64494244,02,02,2023

The accompanying expression of regret suggested Beijing did not want the incident to mar the secretary of state´s visit - the first of its kind in five years.  But the damage was done.Hours after China´s apology, the US State Department called off the trip.Given how wide the rift has become, the fact that the trip was happening in the first place had been cause for celebration.But now what remains is a sense of huge missed opportunity. All along, US officials had made clear that this was not about breakthroughs. It was about talking.Mr Blinken wants to ""avoid competition veering into conflict"".  ""One of the ways you do that is making sure that you actually have good lines of communication,"" he said in a speech last month, calling for ""putting some guardrails into the relationship.""  That means restoring regular contacts and establishing working norms.   ""I think the goal [was] to basically fast-forward this Cold War to its détente phase, thereby skipping a Cuban Missile Crisis,"" says Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.  US halts Blinken China visit after spy balloon rowWhy use a spy balloon instead of satellites?It hasn´t been an easy ride for the world´s two biggest economies.A Trump-era trade war, tensions over Taiwan and an increasingly assertive China under Xi Jinping derailed the relationship in recent years. And it plummeted further as China refused to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Then came a meeting between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in November.The two leaders expressed the desire to avoid conflict and reduced the heat of their rhetoric.  And Mr Blinken wanted to build on that. Even before the balloon went up, the shift was one of tone, more than substance.The Americans have continued to press ahead with the economic restrictions and military expansion in the region, angering Beijing.In the past week, Japan and the Netherlands were reported to have reached an agreement with Washington to restrict exports of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to China.This would be only the latest step by the US to limit Beijing´s access to sensitive semiconductor technology, cutting it out of microchip supply chains.  ""This shows the US has taken a much harder line on tech transfer, trying to get key allies on board,"" says Chris Miller, a professor of international history who wrote a book about US-China tensions over chip technology.And in the past few days, the US military announced it was expanding its presence in the Philippines - one of several moves to strengthen regional alliances as it positions itself to counter China amid growing concern over a possible conflict with Taiwan.  But the Biden administration still wanted to talk.   Mr Blanchett said the White House thought this was a good time to do so, because it had won some breathing room with a Congress hawkish on China by establishing a track record of being tough on Beijing, moving beyond steps taken by former President Donald Trump.   Instead, the balloon gave Republicans an opening to lead the charge in demanding action against China´s ""brazen disregard for US sovereignty"".State department officials emphasised they had not given up, that the diplomatic contacts continued to set up another meeting. But they gave no date, adding to the sense of a consequential relationship in limbo.Additional reporting by Tessa WongRelated TopicsAntony BlinkenChinaUnited StatesChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64519356,03,02,2023

The appointed investigator will review classified reports about the 2019 and 2021 federal elections and will make recommendations for future contests.Rival political party leaders have called for a public inquiry. China has denied any election interference, calling the claims ""purely baseless and defamatory"".Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Monday, Mr Trudeau said the reports challenging Canada´s ""sovereignty"" are alarming, and ""strike us to our very core as Canadians"". ""I will be appointing an independent special rapporteur, who will have a wide mandate and make expert recommendations on combating interference and strengthening our democracy,"" Mr Trudeau said.The rapporteur has not yet been chosen, he said, adding that the appointment will be made in the coming days.Mr Trudeau also said he would ask members of parliament and senators in the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (Nsicop) to begin a review of foreign interference and to report its findings to parliament.He added that Canada has long been aware of meddling attempts by China, as well as Iran and Russia. The countries, as well as several other non-state actors, ""have attempted to interfere not only in our democracy, but our country in general"". ""This is not a new problem,"" he said.Why Trudeau is facing calls for a public inquiryA series of reports in the Globe and Mail newspaper and broadcaster Global News in recent weeks, based on leaks from Canadian intelligence sources, detailed alleged attempts by China´s Communist Party to interfere in the last two federal elections.Chinese officials have dismissed the reports as ""purely baseless and defamatory"" and as ""hype"".Conservative politicians have said publicly they were aware of interference in 2021 race, and believe it had cost them several seats - though not enough to change the election result, which Mr Trudeau´s Liberals won with a 41-seat lead.A federal public report last week found that efforts to meddle in the 2021 federal election did not affect the results. Federal opposition parties - the New Democrats and the Conservatives - have been pushing for an ""independent and public"" inquiry into the accounts.In response to Mr Trudeau´s announcement, the New Democrats criticised the Nsicop committee probe, arguing it was not an ""acceptable substitute for a public inquiry"". ""The way to stop foreign actors from acting in secret is to refuse to keep their secrets,"" said New Democrat MP Peter Julian.The leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre, called Mr Trudeau´s announcement a ""cover up"" by Liberals ""to avoid accountability"".The rapporteur will have the authority to recommend a public inquiry, Mr Trudeau said in response to critics.""We will abide by their recommendation,"" he said, calling the decision one of the official´s first tasks after being appointed. ""I know there are people out there who don´t believe this is enough,"" Mr Trudeau continued. ""I get that. This is why we´re entrusting further work to someone impartial.""Also on Monday, the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they had opened an investigation into how information about the alleged meddling was leaked to Canadian news outlets.A poll released last week by the Angus Reid Institute found that around 65% of Canadians say they believe that Beijing attempted to meddle in both recent federal elections. Two-thirds of Canadians also said that the federal government should do more to combat election meddling.Related TopicsChinaJustin TrudeauCanada",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64870472,07,03,2023

Meanwhile on Sunday, authorities reported three Covid deaths in mainland China, one more than the day before.However, with the definition of Covid deaths narrowed and mass testing no longer compulsory, government data is no longer reflective of the true scale of the outbreak.Other local and provincial officials have also been providing very different data to that from the central government. On Christmas Eve, a senior health official in the port city of Qingdao reported that half a million people were being infected each day. Those case figures were swiftly removed from news reports. Young Chinese self-infect amid Covid fears for elderlyCelebrity deaths spark fears over China Covid tollMeanwhile Chinese health officials said they would not include Pfizer´s antiviral Covid medicine Paxlovid in its basic medical insurance schemes as a result of the high price quoted by the US firm.The drug, temporarily covered by China´s broad healthcare insurance scheme until 31 March, has seen a sharp increase in demand since China´s Covid cases surged last month.Pfizer would continue to collaborate with the Chinese government and all relevant stakeholders to ""secure and adequate supply"" of the medicine in China, the company said in a statement.On Sunday, Beijing also lifted mandatory quarantine for all international arrivals and opened its border with Hong Kong.In the first wave of pre-holiday travel, official data showed that 34.7 million people travelled domestically on Saturday. This represented an increase of more than a third compared to last year, according to state media.Infections are expected to soar as the country celebrates Lunar New Year later this month, with millions expected to travel from big cities to visit older relatives in the countryside.Overall, more than two billion individual journeys are expected to take place, officials have said.Listen to more on what we know about China´s Covid numbers: More or Less- Behind the Stats - Can China´s data on Covid deaths be trusted-  on BBC SoundsRelated TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64208127,09,01,2023

The cases - three in Gujarat state and one in Odisha - were detected in July, September and November and the patients have recovered, health officials have said.According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases, but reports of the surge in China have created a sense of fear among many people. Several experts have said that India - which witnessed two deadly waves of Covid in 2020 and 2021 - does not have reason to panic.On Thursday, India´s health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in parliament that though cases in China were rising, those in India were ""depleting"". He added that the ministry was closely monitoring new variants and advised states to increase genome sequencing.Earlier this week, the federal government had asked states to send samples of all Covid positive patients to labs runs by a health ministry forum which monitors various strains of Covid in India.Mr Mandaviya also asked states to encourage people to follow social distancing and other rules during the upcoming festive season. Officials have now started conducting random Covid-19 tests on international passengers at airports .India had relaxed air travel guidelines in November, making it optional - ""though preferable"" - for passengers to wear masks on flights and for international passengers to be fully vaccinated. There has been no official announcement about a change in air travel guidelines yet.On Wednesday, Mr Mandaviya had chaired a high-level meeting with health officials to review the Covid situation in the country and appealed to people wear masks, maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and get vaccinated.Over 2.2 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country, but only 27% of the population have taken the booster dose - which India calls a ""precaution dose"" - so far. Chief ministers of several states have been reviewing their preparedness to deal with infections if needed. Later on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to review the situation.Read more India stories from the BBC:India beefs up military at tense China borderWHO stands by ´dangerous´ India cough syrup claimThe rape victim’s mum fighting for India’s daughtersIs India seeing a surge in grisly copycat murders?Indian´s search for dad´s lost grave ends in MalaysiaRelated TopicsAsiaIndiaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64061767,22,12,2022

India, which hosted this week´s G20 talks in the southern city of Bengaluru, issued a wide-ranging ""chair´s summary"" from the meeting, noting there were ""different assessments of the situation"" in Ukraine, and on sanctions imposed on Russia.A footnote said that two paragraphs summarising the war were ""agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China"". The paragraphs were adapted from the G20 Bali Leaders´ Declaration in November, and criticised ""in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine"".After taking a back seat since the invasion a year ago, Beijing has stepped up its diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in recent weeks. Its top diplomat Wang Yi toured Europe this week, culminating in a warm welcome by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.China also this week published a 12-point plan for ending the war in Ukraine, in which it called for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty. However, the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and did not condemn Russia´s invasion.The Chinese document was welcomed by Russia, prompting US President Joe Biden to comment: ""[President] Putin´s applauding it, so how could it be any good?""Zelensky wants to meet China´s Xi to discuss peace planWhy China launched a charm offensiveAfter the G20 meeting, Ajay Seth, a senior Indian official, said in a press conference that Russian and Chinese representatives did not agree to the wording on Ukraine because ""their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues"". ""On the other hand, all the other 18 countries felt that the war has got implications for the global economy"" and needed to be mentioned, he added. The 17-paragraph summary of the summit also referenced the recent earthquake in Turkey, debt in low- and middle-income countries, global tax policy, and food insecurity.Russia´s foreign ministry said it regretted the fact that ""the activities of the G20 continue to be destabilised by the Western collective and used in an anti-Russian... way"". It accused the United States, European Union and G7 nations of ""clear blackmail"", urging them to ""acknowledge the objective realities of a multipolar world"". But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: ""This is a war. And this war has a cause, has one cause, and that is Russia and Vladimir Putin. That must be expressed clearly at this G20 finance meeting."" Previous meetings of G20 members have also failed to produce a joint statement since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. On Thursday, the UN General Assembly in New York overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warChinaRussiaIndiaG20",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64773618,25,02,2023

What are China´s Covid rules now?In December, China dropped mass testing in cities and regions where there have been outbreaks. People are no longer required to go into quarantine in state facilities if they or someone they have been in contact with tests positive.Image source, ReutersImage caption, There were widespread protests against China´s rigid Covid restrictionsThere are reports of hospitals filling up with patients and a growing demand for funeral services.But officially, China is reporting relatively low numbers of Covid cases and a tiny number of deaths.Because it has ended its mass testing programme, Chinese authorities no longer have reliable figures for the number of Covid infections.The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked it to provide specific data on disease severity and hospital admissions.China´s hospitals seem to be filling up - WHO´Everyone I know is getting a fever´ - Covid hits China Covid wave batters China´s overstretched hospitalsThe WHO has also asked for more data on vaccination rates, especially amongst vulnerable groups and those over 60 years old.The EU has confirmed that it´s ready offer surplus vaccines to China, which has so far largely relied on its own home-produced vaccines.How many people have been vaccinated in China?Official figures for November 2022 suggest Chinese health authorities have now vaccinated 40% of over-80s with two jabs and a booster. People in this age range are the most vulnerable to the virus. This is a big improvement on China´s past performance.In April 2022, fewer than 20% of over-80s had had two jabs and a booster. China is now reported to have set a goal for 90% of its over-80s to receive either the initial two vaccination jabs, or both plus a booster, by the end of January.However, vaccinations alone may not be enough to halt the surge in Covid cases.Experts believe that because the Chinese population has been locked down so much, many people have not picked up ""hybrid immunity"".This means they haven´t gained protection both from being vaccinated and from being exposed to the virus through other people.  Why have so few elderly people been vaccinated?When China´s government started rolling out vaccines in late 2020, it prioritised the working-age population. It did not test its vaccines on many elderly people, and told them it could not say whether the jabs were safe for this age group.The head of China´s Covid expert panel, Prof Liang Wannian, says that made some people reluctant to get their jabs.""Many old people have underlying diseases,"" he says. ""They reckon it won´t be safe to get vaccinated.""Are China´s Covid vaccines effective?China has mainly used only its domestically-produced vaccines: CoronaVac, made by a company called Sinovac, and Sinopharm.Both use parts of a dead coronavirus to expose the body to Covid and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A vaccine production plant in ShanghaiBut studies suggest they are less effective than the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, widely used in Western countries. Research published in December last year, which looked at data from Singapore, found that mRNA vaccines worked better than Chinese vaccines in preventing severe illness in the over-60s.These train the immune system to attack the spike protein on the virus - the part of the virus which infects the body´s cells. They offer greater protection against severe disease or death. What do we know about China´s Covid-19 vaccines?Why has China not used Western Covid vaccines?China claims to have made about half of all the world´s Covid vaccine stock. But the government has not given approval to foreign-produced mRNA vaccines for general use in mainland China. BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer to produce a Covid vaccine, has also worked with a Shanghai-based company, Fosun Pharma, to develop the same mRNA-based vaccine.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China has largely relied on home-produced vaccines like SinopharmThis has been made available to German nationals living in China, and is also available in Hong Kong and Macau. However, it is not currently authorised for the Chinese mainland market.China is reported to be developing its own mRNA vaccines, and although one has been given approval for emergency use in Indonesia, it is not being used in China at the moment.When asked about the EU offer to send surplus stock of its mRNA vaccines, a Chinese official spokesperson, Mao Ning, said that China already had an adequate supply of vaccines.""China´s Covid situation is predictable and under control,"" she told a news conference on 3 January.Related TopicsCoronavirus vaccinesChinaVaccinationCoronavirus pandemicTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

With the deal, Washington has stitched the gap in the arc of US alliances stretching from South Korea and Japan in the north to Australia in the south.The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints - Taiwan and the South China Sea.The deal, which in part reverses the US´ departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. ""There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,"" says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""The US is not looking for permanent bases. It´s about places, not bases."" The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will ""allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges"", likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. The statement came after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. The US hasn´t said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan - if you don´t count China.China criticised the agreement, saying ""US actions escalate regional tension and undermine regional peace and stability"". ""The United States, out of its self interests and zero-sum game mentality, continues to step up military posture in this region,"" its embassy said in a statement.These days the US is seeking access to places where ""light and flexible"" operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay. Then in 1991 the Philippine government called time. The Filipinos had recently overthrown the hated dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and sending the old colonial masters home would further cement both democracy and independence. The Vietnam war was long over, the Cold War was winding down, and China was as yet a military weakling. So, in 1992, the Americans went home - or at least most of them did. US reopens Pacific embassy in push to counter ChinaHow US Marines are being reshaped for China threatThe US wants to play in China´s backyardRoll forward 30-odd years and another Marcos is back in the Malacañang Palace. More important, China is no longer a military weakling, and it´s knocking on the Philippines´ front door. Manila has watched - horrified but powerless to intervene - as Beijing has set about redrawing the map of the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea as Manila insists on calling it. Since 2014 China has built 10 artificial island bases, including one at Mischief Reef, deep inside the Philippines´ own exclusive economic zone or EEZ. Up to then relations between Manila and Beijing had been free of major problems, says Herman Kraft, a political science professor at University of the Philippines. ""We had a live and let live situation in the South China Sea. But in 2012 they tried to seize control of Scarborough Shoal. Then in 2014 they began building the islands. The land grab by China changed the relationship.""""We have very limited capability against the threat from China,"" says former Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia Jr. He says the Chinese have repeatedly broken promises not to  militarise their new South China Sea bases. ""The Chinese have militarised those features and that puts more of our territory under threat. Only the US has the power to stop them. The Philippines cannot do it alone.""But this time there will not be thousands of US marines and airmen filling the red-light districts of Olongapo or Angeles city again. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Olongapo, close to a US naval base, was a hub for the illegal sex trade in the 1970sThe history of violence and abuse by US troops in the Philippines is still a sensitive subject.  There are an estimated 15,000 children left with their Filipino mothers when their American fathers went home. ""We have a long history of inequality in our relationship,"" says Renato Reyes, secretary general of New Patriotic Alliance, a left-wing group. ""The Philippines has been forced to shoulder the social costs. There´s a history of rape, child abuse, and of toxic waste.""The US´ return to the Philippines is strongly opposed by the country´s left-wing groups. While there won´t be as many troops as earlier, Washington is now asking for access to several new locations, some facing the South China Sea, others facing north towards Taiwan. Unofficial reports point to options in Cagayan, Zambales, Palawan and Isabela. The first one faces Taiwan, the second the Scarborough shoal, and the third the Spratly Islands. Any new US facilities will be inside existing Philippine bases. US troops will come in small groups and on rotation.The aim, says Mr Poling, will be to deter further territorial expansion by China in the South China Sea, while also providing a place for the US to watch Chinese military movements around Taiwan. ""The Philippines has no way to deter China outside this alliance,"" he says. ""It´s buying BrahMos missiles from India. The US would like to deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles. Together they can hold Chinese vessels."" With increasing concern about a conflict over Taiwan, the Philippines could offer a ""rear access area"" for US military operations, or even a place to evacuate refugees. ""People forget there are between 150,000-200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan,"" Mr Poling says. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Left-wing groups oppose a US military presence in the PhilippinesBut Manila is not about to become a full-blown member of an American alliance to challenge or resist China´s rise, Professor Kraft cautions. ""The Philippines is not doing those things like Australia and Japan, directly challenging Chinese interests in the South China Sea or East China Sea. President Marcos wants good relations with the US. But he also wants good relations with China for economic advantage."" Beijing too has indicated that it does not intend to allow a new base agreement between Manila and Washington to disrupt its relations with its neighbour. In an editorial published to coincide with the arrival of the US defence secretary in Manila, China´s state-run Global Times accused the US of ""setting a trap for the Philippines"" and ""trying to push the Philippines to the frontline of confrontation with China"".  ""We are once again being caught in the middle,"" says Mr Reyes, who believes China is just as much a capitalist imperialist power as the US. ""The Philippines still has a colonial mentality - it looks to the United States as its big brother.""

The Daily Telegraph highlights his claim that his brother and sister-in-law stereotyped his wife, Meghan, as a ""divorced, bi-racial, American actress"", and never really accepted her from the beginning.  The paper also believes the Duke of Sussex didn´t receive as easy a ride as he might have expected from the interviewer Tom Bradby - whom it describes as his ""pal"".  It suggests Mr Bradby refused to let Prince Harry off the hook, and questioned him about his claims to the point where the interview became ""testier"".""We Never Called Royals Racist"" is the Sun´s headline.  It´s a reference to Harry´s attempt to row back on claims made in the couple´s interview with Oprah Winfrey last year.  It suggests viewers will have been ""astonished"" last night, that he denied he and Meghan had accused the Royal Family of racism.  The paper´s editorial says Harry seems to have ""fallen into a deep, dark well of self-obsession"".  The Mirror also concentrates on the attempt to clarify the racism claims - arguing that he´s left it too late to back away from a damaging allegation.The Daily Express, though, thinks Harry has ""put the record straight"" - in what it called an ´extraordinary´ TV interview.  The paper´s royal correspondent feels that the prince tackled the most damaging allegation - that the royals were racist - and that the clarification would be welcomed by them. But the Express criticises Harry for writing the memoir in the first place - suggesting he has ""sold his soul"".  It´s a view the Daily Mail shares.  It says Harry may have tarnished his reputation with what it calls his ""tawdry"" memoir.  Its coverage of yesterday´s interview leads on Harry´s belief that fellow royals were complicit in what he calls the pain and suffering inflicted on his wife.  ""My Family Helped Drive Meghan Out"", is the headline.The same claim preoccupies the Times - but it suggests that Harry was holding out an olive branch to his family - by declaring that the royals weren´t racists.  The paper also reports that King Charles was seen in public for the first time since details of the book emerged - and appeared in good spirits.  Its front page photograph is of events in Brazil, and shows supporters of Jair Bolsonaro storming government buildings.The Guardian also has a picture of the unrest in Brazil, but it leads on hopes of a possible breakthrough on a pay deal for striking nurses.  The paper says it understands that ministers - who are due to hold talks with their unions today - are now prepared to look at a one-off payment, after Downing Street and the Treasury were accused of blocking such a move last month.There´s a big photo on the front of the Financial Times of a passenger being welcomed at Shanghai´s Pudong airport - after China lifted Covid quarantine requirements for international arrivals yesterday.  It also has a report that American and Japanese armed forces are integrating their command structures, to prepare for possible conflict with China, because of tension.Related Internet LinksDaily ExpressDaily MailDaily MirrorDaily StarDaily TelegraphFinancial TimesGuardianIndependentMetroMorning StarSunTimesThe iBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info© 2023 BBC.

The virus tore through Chinese cities and towns after authorities lifted zero-Covid restrictions in December. However fever clinic visit rates have dropped over 90% through January and hospitalisation rates are down over 85%.Separately, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the pandemic remained a global emergency, saying it was too early to lift the highest level of alert which it declared three years ago. It said the weekly Covid death rate had been rising in recent weeks and that more than 170,000 Covid-19-related deaths had been reported globally within the last eight weeks, adding that a lack of surveillance now made it more difficult to track down variants. But the WHO acknowledged that the world was in a better position than during the peak of the Omicron wave a year ago. China eyes life beyond Covid despite high infectionsChinese families reunite for a bittersweet New YearCovid losses mount in rural China: ´There are just too many´Fears that the virus could surge again during the festive period have also not yet been realised.The CDC said: ""There has not been an obvious rebound in Covid cases during the Lunar New Year holidays. ""In this time, no new variant has been discovered, and the country´s current wave is coming to an end.""It also reported a sharp decline in the daily Covid death toll reported by hospitals - from a peak of 4,300 deaths on 4 January to 896 deaths on 23 January.Infectious diseases expert Hsu Li Yang told BBC News: ""This drop in deaths follows the decline in the first huge wave of cases after China relaxed its restrictions, which is understandable and has been seen in virtually every country experiencing a large Covid wave.""We will know soon if the Lunar New Year celebrations will trigger another surge in China cases, but it is unlikely to match what was experienced in December and the earlier part of January 2023.""One of China´s leading epidemiologists - and former head of the CDC - Zeng Guang had earlier this month warned that cases would surge in rural areas during the new year.BBC News has also found evidence of a considerable number of Covid-related deaths in China´s rural regions, as the virus spread from big cities to more remote areas with older populations.However, the CDC said there had been no immediate spike following the festive period.It´s estimated that 226 million passenger trips were taken during the Lunar New Year festive season from 22-27 January - a 70% increase from last year when pandemic restrictions were still in place across many parts of China.  According to CDC data, Covid deaths halved in consecutive weeks in January. A total of 12,658 deaths were recorded between 13-19 January, while 6,364 deaths were recorded the following week.In December, Beijing abruptly ended draconian Covid curbs that had seen millions of its citizens locked down over the past three years. That led to a severe spike in Covid infections and deaths, with some experts estimating a majority of the population contracted Covid in the weeks following.A Peking University study said that as of 11 January, some 900 million people in China had been infected with the coronavirus, amid multiple reports of overcrowded hospitals and crematoria.  However, Chinese authorities initially maintained that there had only been seven deaths since the end of zero-Covid on 7 December, after narrowing its definition of what counts as a Covid death.The National Health Commission later reported almost 60,000 Covid-related deaths between 8 December and 12 January, after it began including deaths from underlying conditions as well as respiratory failure caused by Covid. China´s official Covid data is believed to be vastly underreported, and authorities stopped releasing daily caseload reports last month. Beijing has said it has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law.""Additional reporting by Alexandra FoucheRelated TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64449226,30,01,2023

The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they´re considering providing lethal support,"" he said. He did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China´s potential plans. When pressed on what the US believed China might give to Russia, he said it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition.The US has sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly providing satellite imagery of Ukraine to the mercenary Wagner Group, which supplies Russia with thousands of fighters. Mr Blinken told CBS that ""of course, in China, there´s really no distinction between private companies and the state"".What support is China offering Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries?If China provided Russia with weapons, that would cause a ""serious problem for us and in our relationship"", he added.Relations between Washington and Beijing were already poor after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in early February. Both sides exchanged angry words, but equally both sides appeared embarrassed by the incident and seemed ready to move on.But if China were to deliver weapons to help Russian forces in Ukraine, then US-Chinese relations would deteriorate much more severely.It would be the most ""catastrophic"" thing that could happen to the relationship between the two giants, said top Republican senator Lindsay Graham.""It would be like buying a ticket on the Titanic after you saw the movie,"" he told ABC News. ""Don´t do this.""Mr Blinken´s warning seems to be clearly designed to deter China from doing that.Mr Blinken also said the US was worried about China helping Russia evade Western sanctions designed to cripple Russia´s economy. China´s trade with Russia has been growing, and it is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas, and coal.Nato members, including the US, are sending a variety of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, including tanks. They have stopped short of sending fighter jets, and Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether the US would help other countries supply jets.""We´ve been very clear that we shouldn´t fixate or focus on any particular weapons system,"" he said. He did, however, say that the West must ensure Ukraine had what it needed for a potential counter offensive against Russia ""in the months ahead"". Russia is currently trying to advance in eastern regions of Ukraine, where some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place.The top US diplomat´s remarks come ahead of a scheduled visit by Mr Wang to Moscow, as part of the Chinese foreign policy chief´s tour of Europe.Mr Wang said in Munich on Saturday that China had ""neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire"" for the Ukraine war, Reuters reported.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chinese foreign affairs Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech in Munich on SaturdayChina would publish a document that laid out its position on settling the conflict, Mr Wang said. The document would state that the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, he said.""I suggest that everybody starts to think calmly, especially friends in Europe, about what kind of efforts we can make to stop this war,"" Mr Wang said.He added that there were ""some forces that seemingly don´t want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon"", but did not say who he meant. The Chinese President, Mr Xi, is scheduled to deliver a ""peace speech"" on the anniversary of Russia´s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, 24 February, according to Italy´s foreign minister Antonio Tajani.Mr Tajani told Italian radio that Mr Xi´s speech would call for peace without condemning Russia, Reuters reported.During their meeting, Mr Blinken and Mr Wang also exchanged strong words on the deepening row over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the US. Mr Blinken said during the meeting that the US would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Blinken told CBS that other nations were concerned about what he called China´s ""surveillance balloon program"" across five continents.Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"". China has denied sending a spy balloon.And on Sunday morning, Beijing warned that the US would ""bear all the consequences"" if it escalated the argument over the balloon. China would ""follow through to the end"" in the event ""the US insists on taking advantage of the issue"", it said in a foreign ministry statement reported by Reuters.The full interview with CBS - the BBC´s US broadcasting partner - is due to air on Sunday.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaRussia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64695042,20,02,2023

In Xinzhou region of northern Shanxi province the coffin makers have been busy. We watched the skilled craftsmen as they carved elaborate decorations into the freshly-cut wood. Over recent months, they say, they haven´t had time to stop.One villager, a customer, told us that at times the coffins have sold out. Laughing with a dose of the black humour you find in the area, he added that those in the funeral industry had been ""earning a small fortune"".There has been much debate about the real number of Covid deaths in China, after the virus ripped through its megacities. Some 80% of the population - more than a billion people - have been infected since China scrapped restrictions in December, according to leading epidemiologist Wu Zunyou. Last weekend China reported 13,000 Covid-related deaths in less than a week, adding to the 60,000 deaths it has counted since December.But these deaths have been in hospitals. In rural areas there are only sparse medical facilities and those who die at home are mostly not being counted.There is not even an official estimate for the number of village deaths. But the BBC found evidence the death toll is mounting.We visited a crematorium and they too have been busy, mourners dressed in white walking forward carrying the ceremonial box which would eventually contain the remains of a loved one.In another village, we saw one man and woman loading huge tissue paper birds onto the back of a flatbed truck. ""They´re cranes. You ride the crane into the afterlife,"" the woman said.As they packed up other elaborate, Buddhist images newly made from tissue paper they said they´d had an explosion in demand for their funeral decorations, two or three times what´s normal.Everyone we met in this part of Shanxi who is connected to the funeral industry told us a similar story about an increase in deaths and they all attributed it to the coronavirus.Image caption, Wang Peiwei is determined to put on a good funeral for his sister-in-law""Some sick people are already very weak,"" one man said as he continued to load the truck. ""Then they catch Covid, and their elderly bodies can´t handle it.""We followed the truck to where the artworks were being delivered and met Wang Peiwei, whose sister-in-law had just died.The mother-of-two in her 50s had suffered from severe diabetes for years and then she caught the coronavirus.""After she got Covid she had a high fever, and her organs began to fail. Her immune system wasn´t strong enough to make it,"" said Mr Wang.The courtyard at the family house was filling up with decorations for the ceremony. Mr Wang told us there were still more images, flowers and the like to come.Standing in front of a tent in the courtyard where her body was covered up he explained that, on the day of the funeral, 16 people would carry her coffin and bury her in accordance with tradition.He said that, though the cost of funeral arrangements had skyrocketed because of the number of Covid deaths, they would pay the extra money in her honour.""She was a great person. We must hold a grand event to send her off, the best we can afford,"" he said. Every year, hundreds of millions of younger people go back to their hometowns at this time to celebrate the Lunar New Year. It´s China´s most important festival.The villages they are returning to are now places where mostly older people live - people who are more vulnerable to Covid.Image caption, Millions of people have travelled back to their hometowns from big citiesThere has been great concern that this year´s Spring Festival mass migration could quickly spread the coronavirus into more remote areas, to deadly effect.The government warned those in the cities not to go home this year if their elderly relatives had not yet been infected.Doctor Dong Yongming, who operates a very small village clinic, thinks at least 80% of residents there had already caught Covid.""All the villagers come to us when they´re sick,"" he said. ""We´re the only clinic here.""Most who had died there had underlying diseases, he said.In terms of managing the medicine they had as Covid hit the village, Dr Dong said they would not sell medicine to people beyond their needs.""For example, I would only give out four Ibuprofen tablets per person,"" he said. ""They don´t need two boxes. It´ll just be wasted.""However he said he believed the worst of this Covid wave was already behind them: ""We haven´t had any patients in recent days.""Those who die in this region are buried in the fields. Farmers then continue to plant crops and raise livestock around the mounds of their ancestors.Driving along the road we noticed fresh mounds of earth with red flags placed on the top. A lot of them. A farmer herding goats confirmed that they were new graves.""Families have been burying elderly people here after they die. There are just too many,"" he said.Image caption, Fresh graves dot the nearby fieldsIn his village of a few thousand, he said that more than 40 residents had died during the most recent Covid wave.""One day someone would die, then the next day someone else. It´s been non-stop over the past month,"" he said.But in the countryside here, they are quite philosophical about life and death. This farmer said people would still celebrate the new year like they always have.""My son and daughter-in-law will come back soon,"" he said. I asked if locals were worried that family members returning could mean more infections.""People shouldn´t worry. No fear!"" he said. ""You will still become infected even if you hide. Most of us have already got it and we are fine.""He, and many others are hoping that Covid´s most deadly work has already been done and that, for the time being at least, their energy can be spent on being with the living rather than burying the dead.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64347085,25,01,2023

Speaking at the conference, Mr Lavrov said he appreciated the ""well balanced"" and ""considerate"" approach of South Africa to the Ukraine war, which South Africa´s Dr Pandor said must be resolved diplomatically and through negotiation.Officials in South Africa have repeatedly said they do not condone the invasion but will not be forced into choosing sides and are continuing to engage with both countries in a business-as-usual manner.Critics of South Africa´s stance have accused the country of playing coy.South Africa´s leaders have a connection to Russian dating back to the fight against white-minority rule, or apartheid, when some members of the country´s liberation movement received military training in Russia.In recent years that relationship has grown into business ties through the Brics bloc of emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Mr Lavrov was also in Africa in July 2022, when he visited Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville, and South Africa is not alone in refusing to take sides in the war in Ukraine.Many African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West and East Africa respectively - voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March last year, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine.However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa, including South Africa.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warSergei LavrovRussiaSouth Africa",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64373448,23,01,2023

The previous coldest temperature on record in the city was -52.3C, in 1969. However, the temperature is probably still shy of China´s national record.The coldest temperature ever recorded in China is -58C, in the city of Genhe, Inner Mongolia in December 2009, according to media reports of a visit by government meteorologists.Other records, however, have the 1969 cold snap in Mohe as the lowest - meaning Sunday´s -53C temperature could be China´s lowest ever.By contrast, the lowest temperature recorded in the UK is -27.2C, set in different parts of Scotland in 1895, 1982 and 1995.Mohe is no stranger to cold weather: China Daily says the city is regarded as the coldest  in China, and that its winter period ""usually lasts eight months"". As a result, it attracts tourists throughout the year with its ""North Pole"", ice and snow parks, and skiing venues. In previous years, it has also hosted winter marathons.  This time of year, it is common for the city to see average temperatures of -15C.  In the past week, China´s meteorological authority issued alerts for plunging temperatures and cold winds in the region. The Xinhua News Agency said a number of areas in the Greater Khingan mountain range, which spans Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang, saw new record low temperatures over the weekend.  Since Friday, temperatures dipped below -50C in Mohe for three consecutive days, which outlets have said is unprecedented.  Beijing News reported on Friday that coal consumption has increased by a third in the city, as the cold weather bites.  Car companies also told the paper they had taken advantage of the cold to test the braking performance of vehicles.  One resident told Kanji Video that his hands had been numb within 10 seconds of stepping outdoors, but that he had seen very few other people around.  ""It becomes hazy about 100m in front of you, you can´t see anyone,"" he said.A tourist, surnamed Li, told Beijing News that he had made a special trip from China´s southernmost province, Guangdong, to experience the extreme weather. ""I didn´t expect it to get below -50C this year, it was quite a surprise,"" he told the paper. Meanwhile, the official broadcaster, CCTV, showed a journalist breaking an egg on an outdoor surface - causing the egg to freeze within seconds.  More generally, the media are paying tribute to essential workers - including police officers, firefighters, soldiers and street cleaners - who are continuing to work outdoors during the cold. China has seen record temperatures over the past year, for heat as well as cold. Earlier this month, the Xinhua news agency said that the country had recorded the hottest summer and autumn in 60 years, with multiple cities breaking records. Climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather generally - and while scientists agree global temperatures are rising, that doesn´t mean we will stop having periods of very cold weather.Follow Kerry on Twitter: @kerrya11enImage source, CCTVImage caption, Chinese audiences have watched a cracked egg freeze within seconds on state TVRelated TopicsAsiaChinaBBC MonitoringClimate changeSevere weather",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64378176,23,01,2023

There are no buses with special plastic dividers waiting to take you to centralised quarantine. The main reminder that Covid is still around is that people are wearing masks.It feels weird.You still need a PCR test before flying and arriving passengers fill in a health declaration form, accessible via phone apps. This then generates a temporary QR code. You scan the code when you come through the airport and then, after clearing immigration, simply walk out and into China.As a journalist, I had to wait for an hour for special clearance to enter. During that time I and another waiting reporter had a long chat with one of the immigration police.It was the first day they didn´t have to wear the ""da bai"" (big white) protective gear over their uniforms or face shields or shoe covers. Was it a relief?""Yeah, it actually wasn´t that bad,"" he said.Chinese New Year is fast approaching but this officer said he would not be heading back to his hometown to ring in the Year of the Rabbit. There would be too much work for the immigration police over the coming weeks making sure that the new travel systems were in place and operating, he said.Getting rid of most zero-Covid travel restrictions before the Spring Festival has meant that many who have not been able to visit friends and relatives in China are rushing to buy plane and train tickets in time. Then there are the Chinese citizens who haven´t been able to go overseas for years - they too are making plans again. Most observers expect international tourists will soon be allowed back in.The speed of the change in China´s Covid approach has been breathtaking.What seems to have triggered this dramatic about-face were the protests against China´s zero-Covid policy late last year. Discontent had been building for a long time, but once demonstrators started chanting publicly that leader Xi Jinping should resign and the Communist Party give up power, that was more than even this country´s all-powerful government could bear.Image source, ReutersImage caption, There are long queues at offices issuing passports and permits to travel to Hong KongThe end of mass-testing, city-wide lockdowns and centralised quarantine sent Covid flying through the Chinese population.Big city hospitals were soon being swamped. Social media is full of images of hospital corridors packed with elderly patients on oxygen support.The real death toll is unknown. China´s health officials announced that they would not be counting deaths from other causes among the Covid statistics, even if coronavirus indirectly caused a patient to die by triggering other health problems. As a result, the official death toll is being ridiculed by Chinese people.One woman told the BBC about the death of her mother-in-law. Her story paints a picture of a funeral system under huge strain, suggesting the Covid death toll is considerable.First it was impossible to get an ambulance to rush her mother-in-law to hospital, she said. Then after she died her body was at one point stored on the floor in a room full of corpses.She said she had been told that Beijing had temporarily transformed a cold storage site so that it could accommodate bodies. It took more than a week for her family to get a slot at the crematorium for a funeral service and when we spoke to her they were still waiting for the cemetery to give them a location to place the urn containing her mother-in-law´s remains.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Hospitals like this one in Shanghai have struggled for space to put patients inIt is hard to convey the paradoxical mood in China right now. There are those who have lost loved ones or have had a bad dose of Covid - but there is also considerable joy because the country is re-opening. Government officials say many provinces and cities have passed the peak of infections.The new year mass migration has already started. You see people wheeling their luggage in the direction of the train stations, carrying gifts for their families. Tens of millions of people have already travelled with an estimated two billion trips expected.In Beijing´s Jianguomen district, a 53-year-old woman working in a little shop selling nuts told us she had not been home for the new year since the Covid crisis began. ""I can´t wait to go home. I´ve been working hard all year,"" she said. ""I want to see my parents who are getting old. My kids are there too. They´re all looking forward to my return. We can have a family reunion and ring in the new year together!""She says she feels guilty for being away from home for so long. Her 84-year-old father and 77-year-old mother have both caught the virus and recovered, as has she. So she said they could get on with normal life now.Young Chinese self-infect amid Covid fears for elderlyCelebrity deaths spark fears over China Covid tollA few doors down is a noodle restaurant and a couple in their 50s who work there are on their break. Their boss still hasn´t told them whether they can have time off to travel back to their hometown in the eastern Anhui province.They hadn´t been home in three years ether. ""We´ve lost a lot of money during the Covid crisis yet rent remains the same. So we just keep working.""Don´t they want to go home this year?""Of course, we´d love to but we don´t have the money,"" they say together. The woman explains that their restaurant being forced to close for dine-in services for months on end hit them hard financially.Image source, EPAImage caption, People are saying things will be better in the Year of the RabbitHave their parents, aged in their 80s and 90s, caught Covid?""They must have got it,"" the man says. ""There were no test kits in our hometown but they felt unwell, got a fever and coughed a lot. Took some medicine and recovered.""Outside the restaurant a mother with her six-year-old son tells us they won´t be leaving Beijing any time soon. Though they´ve had Covid they say they´re worried about catching it again in a second wave of infections.Further along the road there is a man with his son who have a completely different attitude. They´re in Beijing on holiday. Neither of them have caught Covid yet but they say they´re not worried. The father says his grandparents have already recovered from the virus back in their hometown in Zhengzhou, in central Henan province, and that they will be heading there soon for the Spring Festival.Images of rabbits are going up everywhere. They look cute and happy and seem to embody the optimism which is now spreading.It has been a tough few years in China but you´ll hear people saying that during the Year of the Rabbit things are going to be so much better.And who can blame them for looking forward to better times?Listen to Stephen McDonell´s report from Beijing on the BBC´s From Our Own CorrespondentRelated TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemicTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

A quick guide to China’s Covid rule changesHow many cases and deaths are there in China?France, Spain and others bring in China Covid testsIn a statement issued after talks with Chinese officials the UN health agency said: ""WHO again asked for regular sharing of specific and real-time data on the epidemiological situation... and data on vaccinations delivered and vaccination status, especially in vulnerable people and those over 60.""The agency said it was willing to provide support on these areas, as well as help with addressing the issue of vaccine hesitancy.It also stressed ""the importance of monitoring, and the timely publication of data, to help China and the global community to formulate accurate risk assessments and to inform effective responses"".WHO´s technical advisory group on the evolution of Covid-19 is set to hold a meeting on Tuesday.

China’s Covid surgeThe sudden lifting of many of China´s restrictions follows November´s protests against the government´s management of the disease.Until then, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as a zero-Covid policy.It included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.Lockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished. People are now free to travel abroad again.Cases have since been on the rise, with the Chinese government reporting about 5,000 a day. But analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.Officially there have only been 13 Covid deaths throughout December, but UK-based health data firm Airfinity said on Thursday that around 9,000 people in China are probably dying each day from the disease.

Two naval ships, including one with a heavy crane for recovery, are in the area.In a Pentagon statement a senior US defence official said that ""while we took all necessary steps to protect against the PRC [China] surveillance balloon´s collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloon´s overflight of US territory was of intelligence value to us. ""We were able to study and scrutinise the balloon and its equipment, which has been valuable,"" the official added.US President Joe Biden had been under pressure to shoot it down since defence officials first announced they were tracking it on Thursday.Afterwards, Mr Biden said: ""They successfully took it down, and I want to compliment our aviators who did it.""In a statement a few hours later, the Chinese foreign ministry said: ""The Chinese side has repeatedly informed the US side after verification that the airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident."" The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off this weekend´s trip to China over the ""irresponsible act"". The Chinese authorities have denied it is a spying aircraft, and instead said it was a weather ship blown astray. Balloon saga deflates efforts to mend US-China relationsWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?Reacting to the incident, Taiwan´s foreign ministry said in a statement: ""The Chinese Communist Party government´s actions that violate international law and violate the airspace and sovereignty of other countries should not be tolerated in a civilised international community.""China considers self-ruled Taiwan a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing´s control. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve this.But Taiwan sees itself as independent, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.President Biden first approved the plan to down the balloon on Wednesday, but the Pentagon said it had decided to wait until the object was over water so as not to put people on the ground at undue risk.Groundwork for the operation was laid when the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast on Saturday afternoon because of a ""national security effort"". The coast guard also advised mariners to leave the area due to military operations ""that present a significant hazard"". An eyewitness on the coast, Hayley Walsh, told BBC News she saw three fighter jets circling before the missile was fired, then ""we heard a huge boom, the house shook"".This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China rowOne senior military official told CNN the recovery of debris should be ""fairly easy"" and could take ""relatively short time"". The official added that ""capable Navy divers"" could be deployed to assist in the operation.Defence officials also revealed on Saturday the balloon had first entered US airspace on 28 January near the Aleutian Islands, before moving to Canadian airspace three days later, and re-entering the US on 31 January. The object was spotted in the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.Relations between China and the US have been exacerbated by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an ""unacceptable violation"" of US sovereignty.Mr Blinken - America´s top diplomat - told Beijing it was ""an irresponsible act"" ahead of his now-cancelled trip on 5-6 February - it would have been the first such high level US-China meeting there in years.But China sought to play down the cancellation of his visit, saying in a statement on Saturday that neither side had formally announced a plan for a trip. China´s foreign ministry said Beijing ""would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype"" and accused ""some politicians and media in the United States"" of using the incident ""as a pretext to attack and smear China.""On Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.Colombia´s Air Force says an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country´s airspace at above 55,000ft.It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.China has not yet commented publicly on the reported second balloon.Related TopicsSpyingAntony BlinkenChinaUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64524105,05,02,2023

The Chinese authorities have so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky´s call for a summit with Mr Xi.Meanwhile, Russia hailed the Chinese peace proposals. ""We share Beijing´s views,"" the foreign ministry in Moscow said in a statement.Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Beijing was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia - a claim strongly denied by Beijing. On Friday, American media again reported that the Chinese government was considering sending drones and artillery shells to Moscow.Asked about the Chinese plan, US President Joe Biden told ABC News on Friday: ""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin´s applauding it, so how could it be any good?""I´ve seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,"" he added.China appears to be siding with Russia, though it would like to find a way of rescuing President Putin by arranging some kind of face-saving peace deal, says the BBC´s World Affairs Editor John Simpson. The Chinese proposals follow a visit by the country´s top diplomat Wang Yi to Moscow, where he met President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday.After the talks, Mr Wang was quoted by China´s state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that Beijing was willing to ""deepen political trust"" and ""strengthen strategic coordination"" with Moscow.Why China launched a charm offensive over UkraineWestern officials gave the latest proposals a lukewarm reception. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing ""doesn´t have much credibility"" because it had ""not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine"".President Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Russian troops made significant advances during the first few days in Ukraine´s north, east and south.But the attack on the capital Kyiv was soon repulsed and the Ukrainian military was later able to retake large areas.The conflict - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - has since become a grinding war of attrition.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsAt a lengthy news conference in Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky also said victory ""will inevitably await us"" if allies ""respect their promises and deadlines"".Poland said it had already delivered four German-made Leopard II tanks to Ukraine and was ready to deliver more. Germany has said it will provide 14 Leopard tanks, with Spain and Canada also sending tanks. The US - by far the biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine - has pledged to send 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks and the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks.The Ukrainian leader added that his country had failed to engage sufficiently with countries in Africa and Latin America after many nations in those continents abstained during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution condemning Russia´s invasion. ""We didn´t work well for many years, we didn´t pay attention, I think it´s a big mistake,"" he said.Asked if he could name his worst moment of the war so far, Mr Zelensky said Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops are accused of having killed civilians in the early part of the war. The small town had been under Russian control until Ukrainian troops fought back last April to reclaim it.""What I saw. It was horrible,"" Mr Zelensky said, visibly moved.How Putin´s fate is tied to his war in UkraineChina´s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visit The US marked a year since Russia invaded Ukraine by announcing a new range of sanctions against Russia and new aid for Ukraine.The latest restrictions target more than 100 entities both within Russia and worldwide, including banks and suppliers of defence equipment. The US said it wanted to stop those helping Russia exploit loopholes to get sanctioned materials.The White House´s fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $12bn (£10bn), comprising $2bn from the Department of Defense including ammunition and drones and $10bn from the State Department including budgetary support to the Ukrainian government. A further $550m will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.Moldova is Europe´s poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.It comes days after US President Joe Biden flew to Kyiv for a surprise visit and held talks with Mr Zelensky.On Friday, the EU also approved its 10th round of sanctions against Russia, imposing restrictions on technology that has a civilian and military dual use.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingVolodymyr ZelenskyChinaMoldovaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64762219,25,02,2023

The Panamera has a starting price of $148,000.The promotion attracted hundreds of would-be buyers who rushed to secure what appeared to be a bargain.A spokesperson for the German car maker told the BBC that the promotion ""contained a serious mistake in the listed retail price"", which was taken down immediately.""As there was only one vehicle in stock, in accordance with the sales process, Porsche Centre Yinchuan has communicated with the first customer who made an online refunded reservation fee and has negotiated an agreeable outcome"", they added.VW values Porsche at up to $75bn in share saleLuxury cars up in smoke after ship catches fireThe dealership also contacted ""every bidder individually and explained the situation with apology"".The incorrect information was posted on 30 January and customers who paid the 911 yuan reservation fee have been refunded, Porsche said.The incident caused a stir on Chinese social media, with one commentator posting ""This is why I don´t buy Porsche lol"".Others thought that it was just a promotional strategy that was ""well conducted"".It was also suggested that the company had been ""irresponsible"" and should have honoured the cut-price offer.Another social media user claimed to be the first person to try to buy the car but had cancelled their order when they were told the real price. They said it would have been wrong to try to take advantage of a mistake.Porsche started selling cars in mainland China more than 20 years ago.In recent years the company expanded its footprint in the world´s second largest economy as it opened new dealerships.The country is now Porsche´s largest single market globally, with sales totalling $6.2bn in the first six months of last year.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Electric cars are said to be the future, but are we quite there yet?Related TopicsChinaCar industry",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64507453,03,02,2023

But analysts believe China downplays how much it spends on defence. In the past decade, China´s defence budget has risen by about 10% each year, with 2014 seeing the highest increase of 12.2%. The ""external attempts to suppress and contain China are escalating"", according to Outgoing Premier Li Keqiang´s government work report. ""The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board,"" the report said. It was also announced at the meeting that China would pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year.The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.But this year´s sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions.This week´s NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi´s leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party re-elected him as their leader for a third term.The increase in military spending comes as Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.US officials have also repeatedly warned that China may invade Taiwan in the coming years. China has held ever-growing displays of military force in the air and seas around Taiwan, including the firing of ballistic missiles.China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing´s control. The NPC will also unveil the new premier, China´s equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi´s most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role.

The row got to the heart of a debate about whether this kind of outlet hurts or helps Kenyans.Blowing whistles and vuvuzelas, Kenyan petty traders marched in their hundreds to the deputy president´s office in Nairobi to demand an end to what they called a ""China invasion"".The China Square shop that had become a hit with consumers because of its cheap goods was the focus of their anger. Its rapid success had rekindled long-held fears about competition from abroad.The shop, which is in a mall on the outskirts of Nairobi, had already shut its doors, albeit temporarily, by the time of last week´s protest as controversy swirled around it.Barely five weeks into trading, it had become a social media phenomenon. Its low prices compared to what the petty traders were charging and convenient location made it very attractive.But some small-scale traders, who form a vital part of Kenya´s economy, began to notice business dropping off.""We want the Chinese out of Kenya. If the Chinese become the manufacturers, distributors, retailers and even hawkers, where will Kenyans go?"" an unnamed trader told journalists at the protest.Peter Sitati, who imports and sells beauty equipment in Nairobi, was one of those at the demonstration.He says a plastic pedicure stool that costs around $43 (£35) in his shop, retailed at China Square for about $21, effectively undercutting him by more than 50%.""Many Kenyan businesses are going to close their shops and our economy will collapse,"" Mr Sitati argued.Image source, Peter SitatiImage caption, Peter Sitati says he is not able to sell his goods at China Square´s lower pricesPressed to explain why he was charging so much more, he said he was covering the taxes and duty he was charged and thought that he might be buying the goods from China at a higher price than China Square.Despite being asked by the BBC, China Square did not explain how it set its prices, but it might be benefitting from being able to buy in bigger quantities. It may also have a more direct relationship with the manufacturers. A lot of the smaller Kenyan traders have to go through middle men and may be charged more as a result.China Square founder Lei Cheng insisted he had done nothing wrong.""My business is legal and is centred on healthy competition. We have cooperated with all government directives of opening a business in Kenya and we are here to break the monopoly,"" Mr Lei said.He added that his business took more than $157,000 in its first two weeks.""The people who are fighting us feel threatened because Kenyans now know we exist and we are not exploiting them in pricing.""´Quality goods, affordable prices´Some Kenyan shoppers are on the retailer´s side.""China Square should be allowed to operate. They´re selling quality goods at affordable prices,"" Sharon Wanjiku said.""The cost of living is very high at the moment and these prices are exactly what we need.""The swift popularity of the shop followed by the controversy caught the attention of the government, with one minister saying it should cease operating as a retailer.""We welcome Chinese investors to Kenya but as manufacturers not traders,"" Trade Minister Moses Kuria said on Twitter on the Friday before China Square shut down.It remains unclear why the shop did close its doors to customers. There were suspicions that it had been put under some pressure by the authorities.A statement from China Square said it was closing to ""re-evaluate and replan our company strategy"" and that it was ""considering a possibility of co-operating with local traders"".But at the end of last week, Kenya´s Anti-Counterfeit Authority said it had investigated a complaint that China Square was selling fake goods but had found no evidence that that was the case.On Monday, the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce (KCCC) welcomed the re-opening of China Square after discussions were held with the government, however it did not go into details of what the talks were about.""The Chamber looks forward to an equal and fair treatment of all businesses across [the] board to ensure a conducive business environment for all,"" the KCCC statement said, but it did not say if any new agreement had been made.Image source, EPAImage caption, The protest against China Square attracted a large crowdSome fear that the row over the shop has sent out the wrong message about the economy and the interest in investment.Korir SingOei, from the ministry of foreign affairs, has been seeking to reassure potential investors, saying that Kenya welcomes money from outside and does not discriminate where it comes from.Wu Peng, the top diplomat for Africa at China´s Foreign Ministry, was pleased with the clarification and said a ""non-discriminatory investment environment is vital to the healthy development of bilateral practical co-operation"".Kenya has in the past struggled to find a middle ground between attracting foreign investment and promoting free trade while protecting local traders from what some see as unfair competition.""Stopping foreigners from doing legitimate business in Kenya is retrogressive. We need to see how to build the capacity of Kenyans to be able to produce competitive products,"" says Kenyan economist Gerrishon Ikiara. DeportationsThe Kenya Investment Promotion Act, which sets conditions for foreign investors, requires an investment to be beneficial to the country through things such as new jobs, the transfer of new skills or technology, or the use of local raw materials or services.There is no data available to show how many Chinese traders or people are in Kenya, but there has been growing anti-Chinese sentiment in recent years. This has been partly due to allegations that individual Chinese people in Kenya have been racist, as well as fears of Chinese traders taking businesses and jobs from Kenyans.In 2019, the Kenyan authorities deported seven Chinese nationals who had been operating in two markets in Nairobi, accusing them of not having work permits and saying they could not operate in a sector that had been reserved for locals.In 2020, four Chinese men were deported after being accused of caning a Kenyan man working at a Chinese restaurant. President William Ruto has so far steered clear of the matter, but ahead of his election last year he promised to deport Chinese nationals engaging in business that can be done by Kenyans.""We have agreements with different countries on what level of business or work is to be done by locals and which one is allowed, where one must have [a] work permit, to foreigners. And that level is not selling in kiosks, retail or roasting maize,"" Mr Ruto said last June.China Square is clearly not working out of a kiosk, but its re-opening continues to present a challenge to the petty traders, whose complaints have not gone away.Related TopicsAfrica–China relationsKenya",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64809423,06,03,2023

China´s population is likely to begin shrinking next year. Last year, 10.6 million people were born, a little more than the number of deaths, thanks to a rapid drop in fertility rate. India´s fertility rate has also fallen substantially in recent decades - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to two births per woman today - but the rate of decline has been slower. So what does India overtaking China as the most populous country in the world mean? China reduced its population faster than IndiaChina reduced its population growth rate by about half from 2% in 1973 to 1.1% in 1983.Demographers say much of this was achieved by riding roughshod over human rights - two separate campaigns promoting just one child and then later marriages, longer gaps between children and fewer of them - in what was a predominantly rural and overwhelmingly uneducated and poor country,Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Population control measures enjoy some support in IndiaIndia saw rapid population growth - almost 2% annually - for much of the second half of the last century. Over time, death rates fell, life expectancy rose and incomes went up. More people - especially those living in cities - accessed clean drinking water and modern sewerage. ""Yet the birth rate remained high,"" says Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics.India launched a family planning programme in 1952 and laid out a national population policy for the first time only in 1976, around the time China was busy reducing its birth rate. But forced sterilisations of millions of poor people in an overzealous family planning programme during the 1975 Emergency - when civil liberties were suspended - led to a social backlash against family planning. ""Fertility decline would have been faster for India if the Emergency hadn´t happened and if politicians had been more proactive. It also meant that all subsequent governments treaded cautiously when it came to family planning,"" Prof Dyson says. East Asian countries such as Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand, which launched population programmes much later than India, achieved lower fertility levels, cut infant and maternal mortality rates, raised incomes and improved human development earlier than India.Yet India is not undergoing a population explosionIndia has added more than a billion people since Independence in 1947, and its population is expected to grow for another 40 years. But its population growth rate has been declining for decades now, and the country has defied dire predictions about a ""demographic disaster"".So India having more people than China is no longer significant in a ""concerning"" way, say demographers.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, India launched a programme of family planning in 1952Rising incomes and improved access to health and education have helped Indian women have fewer children than before, effectively flattening the growth curve. Fertility rates have dipped below replacement levels - two births per woman - in 17 out of 22 states and federally administered territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a steady population.)The decline in birth rates has been faster in southern India than in the more populous north. ""It is a pity that more of India could not have been like south India,"" says Prof Dyson. ""All things being equal, rapid population growth in parts of north India have depressed living standards"".However, overtaking China could be significant It could, for example, strengthen India´s claim of getting a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, which has five permanent members, including China. India is a founding member of the UN and has always insisted that its claim to a permanent seat is just. ""I think you have certain claims on things [by being the country with largest population],"" says John Wilmoth, director of the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.The way India´s demography is changing is also significant, according to KS James of the Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences. Image source, ReutersImage caption, India´s population is expected to peak between 1.6 and 1.8 billion around 2060Despite drawbacks, India deserves some credit for managing a ""healthy demographic transition"" by using family planning in a democracy which was both poor and largely uneducated, says Mr James. ""Most countries did this after they had achieved higher literacy and living standards."" More good news. One in five people below 25 years in the world is from India and 47% of Indians are below the age of 25. Two-thirds of Indians were born after India liberalised its economy in the early 1990s. This group of young Indians have some unique characteristics, says Shruti Rajagopalan, an economist, in a new paper. ""This generation of young Indians will be the largest consumer and labour source in the knowledge and network goods economy. Indians will be the largest pool of global talent,"" she says. The myth of India´s population explosionIndia´s religious make-up little changed since 1951Why some Indians die younger than othersBut there are challenges tooIndia needs to create enough jobs for its young working age population to reap a demographic dividend. But only 40% of of India´s working-age population works or wants to work, according to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). More women would need jobs as they spend less time in their working age giving birth and looking after children. The picture here is bleaker: only 10% of working-age women were participating in the labour force in October, according to CMIE, compared with 69% in China.Then there´s migration. Some 200 million Indians have migrated within the country - between states and districts - and their numbers are bound to grow. Most are workers who leave villages for cities to find work. ""Our cities will grow as migration increases because of lack of jobs and low wages in villages. Can they provide migrants a reasonable living standard? Otherwise, we will end up with more slums and disease,"" says S Irudaya Rajan, a migration expert at Kerala´s International Institute of Migration and Development.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, More than 10% of Indians are over 60 years oldDemographers say India also needs to stop child marriages, prevent early marriages and properly register births and deaths. A skewed sex ratio at birth - meaning more boys are born than girls - remains a worry. Political rhetoric about ""population control"" appears to be targeted at Muslims, the country´s largest minority when, in reality, ""gaps in childbearing between India´s religious groups are generally much smaller than they used to be"", according to a study from Pew Research Center.And then there´s the ageing of IndiaDemographers say the ageing of India receives little attention.In 1947, India´s median age was 21. A paltry 5% of people were above the age of 60. Today, the median age is over 28, and more than 10% of Indians are over 60 years. Southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu achieved replacement levels at least 20 years ago. ""As the working-age population declines, supporting an older population will become a growing burden on the government´s resources,"" says Rukmini S, author of Whole Numbers and Half Truths: What Data Can and Cannot Tell Us About Modern India. ""Family structures will have to be recast and elderly persons living alone will become an increasing source of concern,"" she says.Read more India stories from the BBC:India beefs up military at tense China borderWHO stands by ´dangerous´ India cough syrup claimThe rape victim’s mum fighting for India’s daughtersIs India seeing a surge in grisly copycat murders?Indian´s search for dad´s lost grave ends in MalaysiaRelated TopicsPopulation growthAsiaChinaAgeing populationIndia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-63957562,20,12,2022

China has denied accusations of spying, saying it was monitoring the weather.The incident has led to a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.On Friday - before fighter jets brought down the balloon at the weekend - US military officials said a second Chinese balloon had been spotted over Latin America. On Monday, China admitted an aircraft had ""accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace"".Ms Mao told reporters the second balloon had ""deviated greatly"" from its intended route, citing the aircraft´s ""limited manoeuvrability"" and the weather conditions.""The unmanned airship in question that came from China is of a civilian nature and used for flight tests,"" she added.""China is a responsible country and has always strictly abided by international law in order to inform and properly deal with all parties concerned, without posing any threat to any country.""At the weekend, Colombia´s air force said an object with ""characteristics similar to those of a balloon"" had been detected on 3 February in the country´s airspace at above 55,000ft.Colombia said it had followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?Meanwhile, work by US Navy divers continues to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday.US President Joe Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until it was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk. The US believes the balloon was being used to monitor sensitive military sites.Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China´s suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because ""it has propellers on it"".""This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,"" he added.Relations between China and the US have been strained by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an ""unacceptable violation"" of its sovereignty.

Nevertheless, it reveals the hard hit to the Chinese economy from a zero-Covid policy and a property rout in 2022,"" Jacqueline Rong, deputy China economist from the BNP Paribas bank, told the BBC.Experts have voiced caution over China´s economic numbers - with some warning that the trajectory of the data rather than the figures themselves are a useful guide to how the country´s economy is performing.How China sneaks out America´s technology secretsChina records 60,000 Covid-linked deaths in monthThe US is beating China in the battle for chipsOther Chinese economic data such as retail sales and factory output for December, which were released along with GDP data, also beat expectations but were still weak compared to pre-pandemic levels.""That is not bad news for the economy. It almost feels like household consumption held up well in spite of the surge of infections towards the end of last year,"" Qian Wang from the Vanguard investment firm said.""We are heading into 2023 with stronger momentum... this will pose a lot of upside to economic growth,"" she added.Economists have warned over the state of the global economy in recent months, pointing to several issues having an impact on growth.Last week, the World Bank said that the global economy is ""perilously close to falling into recession"".The organisation´s latest forecast blamed a number of factors stemming from Russia´s invasion of Ukraine and the impact of the pandemic.It said the US, the eurozone and China - the three most influential parts of the world for economic growth - were ""all undergoing a period of pronounced weakness"", a downturn that was worsening the problems faced by poorer countries.GDP is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of the government, companies and individuals in a country.It helps businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and governments to work out how much to tax and spend.On Monday, data released by China´s National Bureau of Statistics showed that prices of new homes declined for the fifth straight month in December.Prices in the final month of 2022 fell by 0.2% from a month earlier as Covid-19 outbreaks across the country hurt demand.Last week, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva urged Beijing to continue reopening its economy.""What is most important is for China to stay the course, not to back off from that reopening,"" Ms Georgieva said.""If they stay the course, by mid-year or there around, China will turn into a positive contributor to average global growth,"" she added.Yating Xu, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told the BBC that she has seen signs of a gradual recovery in Chinese consumer activity since its reopening.""The government´s increasing pro-growth stance and the economic recovery entering 2023 reduces the likelihood of a pandemic-policy reversal,"" she said.""However, the full reopening of mainland China´s borders is likely to be delayed until international restrictions against China-originated travel are dropped,"" she added.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Joy and relief for arrivals in China as quarantine ends for overseas travellersRelated TopicsCoronavirus lockdown measuresChinaGDPEconomic growthCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64286126,17,01,2023

Dr FitzGerald told the BBC.""Then he said in his kind of inimitable wisdom: ´Would you mind travelling economy class?´""That moment would help set the ball rolling for Australia to forge diplomatic ties with China. It achieved that 50 years ago - on 21 December 1972.´Deeply divisive´ issueThe trip was a risky political move for Mr Whitlam.In 1971 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was forcing its way on to the world stage amid the Cold War, seeking improved foreign relationships and a seat at the United Nations.But it faced hurdles from key players like the US, which refused to recognise the CCP as China´s legitimate government.Australia was one such nation. China remained a ""deeply divisive"" issue there, Dr FitzGerald says. At the time, just 3% of its population was born outside Australia or Europe - and many people were suspicious of other cultures. The ""red menace"" of communism was also a great concern. Such fears intersected over China.For many, it resonated when Australia´s conservative government spoke of the threat posed by the ""downward thrust of China"", Dr FitzGerald says. It was easy to ""conjure up the idea of Australia being taken over by Chinese, and not just Chinese, but Chinese who were communist"".""It was a powerful message… even though it was not remotely possible.""Image source, The Whitlam InstituteImage caption, Dr FitzGerald has studied China for decadesOn the other hand, Mr Whitlam had long advocated for Australia to take up relations with China.It was not because of any ideological sympathy for the CCP, Dr FitzGerald says. ""You don´t have to like them... [But] his view was, how can you not have diplomatic relations with the government of a country of that size?""But even within Mr Whitlam´s Labor Party, many regarded any step towards China as ""political death"" domestically.""So it took courage on many fronts,"" Dr FitzGerald says.The accidental ambassadorMr Whitlam´s path to China may have seemed inevitable, but Dr FitzGerald´s was somewhat of a fluke.He didn´t choose to study China. It all snowballed from the moment he was assigned Chinese language classes on his first day as a foreign service cadet. And by the time Mr Whitlam came calling, Dr FitzGerald had left for a career in academia.But if the invitation was a surprise, the trip itself felt even more surreal.""In those days you had to walk into China, there were no flights,"" Dr FitzGerald says. ""We had to go to Hong Kong, take the train up to the border, carry our luggage across, go through immigration and customs on the Chinese side and then board another train.""The delegation toured businesses, factories, schools and tourist sites for two weeks. Dr FitzGerald recalls constantly explaining Australian sense of humour to ""mystified"" Chinese officials.But the real goal of the mission was to meet then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. It was never clear if that would happen - until Chinese officials arrived at the Australians´ hotel late one night and began ushering people into cars.""We drove across the empty Beijing streets to the Great Hall of the People, went up the stairs, through dimly lit corridors into a room, and Zhou Enlai was standing there,"" Dr FitzGerald says.When the much-anticipated meeting began, Mr Zhou surprised the delegation by inviting journalists to stay in the room.Image source, Stephen FitzgeraldImage caption, Gough Whitlam (second from left) speaking with Zhou Enlai (right)The meeting transformed Australia´s feelings towards China. ""The Chinese had been demonised as a cross between red devils and yellow perils - almost as if they had horns. And here was this most sophisticated and civilised, polite and diplomatic, courteous, charming person.""When I watched that meeting between Whitlam and Zhou Enlai, I concluded that relations with China would never be the same again.""All that stood between us and diplomatic relations at that stage was the election during December of 1972.""Mr Whitlam did win the election, ending 23 years of conservative rule. Within weeks, on 21 December, he recognised the People´s Republic of China.Soon after, he sent Dr FitzGerald to Beijing as Australia´s first ambassador to the country. Just 34 at the time, he remains Australia´s youngest ambassador ever.""Of course it was daunting. It couldn´t not be,"" he says. ""But I think that sense was really overwhelmed by the excitement.""Image source, Stephen FitzgeraldImage caption, Mr Whitlam and Dr FitzGerald meet Mao Zedong in 1973Mr Whitlam´s hope was that Australia would build a relationship with China that was comparable to those it had with other major powers, Dr FitzGerald says.But 50 years on, that´s not where things are.Lessons for today?Australia and China have benefited enormously from trade with each other, but bilateral relations have sunk to record lows in recent times. High-level contact was cut off for two years, amid disputes over trade, human rights and foreign interference.But last month Prime Minister Anthony Albanese - who was elected in May - became the first Australian leader to have a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2016.He said it was a ""warm"" and ""very constructive"" chat, but there was no movement on key issues for Australia. Many experts have little optimism that the relationship will significantly improve any time soon.Is China really open to making up with Australia?The year when Australia and China hit ´lowest ebb´Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow at Australia´s Lowy Institute thinktank, told the BBC at the time that too many points of conflict remain. Many of them, she says, are rooted in ""fundamental"" differences such as systems of government or values.""Those issues aren´t going to be resolved by one meeting or even several meetings.""Another such meeting will take place on Wednesday when Australia´s Foreign Minister Penny Wong meets her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Beijing. It marks the first visit by an Australian minister to China´s capital in more than three years.Dr FitzGerald says the China of today seems more ""dictatorially minded"" and ""assertive"", but he still thinks there are lessons in what transpired 50 years ago.""The [Whitlam] government recognised that no matter what has happened, you still have to have relations with the government in that country.""It didn´t mean that everything was sweetness and light, but it meant that we were talking with each other.""Related TopicsChinaAustralia",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-63912368,20,12,2022

For elderly people, they can only count on their own fate,"" Mr Chen says. The final step in China´s swift reversal of its contentious zero-Covid policy comes on Sunday when it reopens borders for international travel. With mass testing, stringent quarantines and sudden, sweeping lockdowns gone, families like Mr Chen´s are wary of what lies ahead. But younger Chinese, all of whom did not wish to be named, feel differently - and some told the BBC they were voluntarily exposing themselves to infection.   A 27-year-old coder in Shanghai, who did not receive any of the Chinese vaccines, says he voluntarily exposed himself to the virus.""Because I don´t want to change my holiday plan,"" he explains, ""and I could make sure I recovered and won´t be infected again during the holiday if I intentionally control the time I get infected."" He admits he did not expect the muscle aches that came with the infection, but says the symptoms have been largely as expected.Another Shanghai resident, a 26-year-old woman, tells the BBC she visited her friend who had tested positive ""so I could get Covid as well"". But she says her recovery has been hard: ""I thought it would be like getting a cold but it was much more painful.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There is concern about how elders will fare under loosened pandemic rulesA 29-year-old who works for a state-run business based in Jiaxing, in the northern Zhejiang province, says she was thrilled when she heard the country´s borders were reopening.

""We´re ahead of the curve on this because we have to be - because we need to earn trust,"" TikTok vice-president of government relations and public policy in Europe Theo Bertram said.A similar plan, Project Texas, is under way in the US. Its back against the wall, TikTok is fighting hard to prove it is no national-security threat.Executives unveiling Project Clover repeatedly said they were going further than other major social networks to protect user privacy.And I can´t think of a time when a Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat held a press conference announcing sweeping privacy changes, with an open Q and A.But will it be enough to save the platform?Chinese telecoms giant Huawei bent over backwards to convince governments it could be trusted.It spent a fortune setting up a transparency centre in Oxfordshire, where for years UK cyber chiefs poured over source code looking for signs of Chinese government interference.None was found - but US-led theoretical concerns about spying still saw Huawei banned from the UK´s 5G networks.Project Clover aims to convince European lawmakers TikTok is safe.But history tells us TikTok´s future will remain in jeopardy unless the US is convinced - and at the moment, the US seems firmly set on taking action against the app.More than 100 million Americans use the viral-video app.But the Canadian and US governments have also restricted its use on official devices.TikTok has said such bans are ""misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security"".And China firmly opposes the action.""How unsure of itself can the world´s top superpower like the US be to fear young people´s favourite app like that?"" China foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.´Diplomatic tensions´The day before Project Clover was announced, US President Joe Biden lent his administration´s support to a bill - promoted by Democrat Mark Warner, who chairs the senate intelligence committee, and Republican John Thune - granting powers to ban foreign-owned technology.TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew will appear before congress later this month.On Tuesday, TikTok told BBC Radio 4´s World Tonight programme it feared becoming a ""pawn"" in diplomatic tensions between the US and China.""It would be hard to deny that we´re caught up in those very broad geopolitics that really have nothing to do with us,"" its US head of public policy Michael Beckerman said.""Almost all the major tech companies also have engineers in China,"" he said, and TikTok was not the only one to gather significant amounts of user data.""And so some of these concerns would extend to all these companies- but that´s why we´re building out the system to ensure that there´s no doubt that data is secure.""Related TopicsTikTokChinaEuropean UnionUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64887704,08,03,2023

It was a technique called steganography, a means of hiding a data file within the code of another data file. Mr Zheng utilised it on multiple occasions to take sensitive files from GE.GE is a multinational conglomerate known for its work in the healthcare, energy and aerospace sectors, making everything from refrigerators to aircraft engines.The information Zheng stole was related to the design and manufacture of gas and steam turbines, including turbine blades and turbine seals. Considered to be worth millions, it was sent to his accomplice in China. It would ultimately benefit the Chinese government, as well as China-based companies and universities. Zheng was sentenced to two years in prison earlier this month. It is the latest in a series of similar cases prosecuted by US authorities. In November Chinese national Xu Yanjun, said to be a career spy, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for plotting to steal trade secrets from several US aviation and aerospace companies - including GE.It is part of a broader struggle as China strives to gain technological knowhow to power its economy and its challenge to the geopolitical order, while the US does its best to prevent a serious competitor to American power from emerging.The theft of trade secrets is attractive because it allows countries to ""leapfrog up global value chains relatively quickly - and without the costs, both in terms of time and money, of relying completely on indigenous capabilities"", Nick Marro of the Economist Intelligence Unit told the BBC.Last July FBI director Christopher Wray told a gathering of business leaders and academics in London that China aimed to ""ransack"" the intellectual property of Western companies so it can speed up its own industrial development and eventually dominate key industries. He warned that it was snooping on companies everywhere ""from big cities to small towns - from Fortune 100s to start-ups, folks that focus on everything from aviation, to AI, to pharma"".At the time, China´s then foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Mr Wray was ""smearing China"" and had a ""Cold War mentality"".´China seeks to topple our status´In the DOJ statement on Zheng, the FBI´s Alan Kohler Jr said China was targeting ""American ingenuity"" and seeking to ""topple our status"" as global leader.Zheng was an engineer specialising in turbine sealing technology and worked on various leakage containment technologies in steam turbine engineering. Such seals optimise turbine performance ""whether by increasing power or efficiency or extending the usable life of the engine"", the DOJ said.Gas turbines that power aircraft are central to the development of China´s aviation industry.  Aerospace and aviation equipment are among 10 sectors that the Chinese authorities are targeting for rapid development to reduce the country´s dependence on foreign technology and eventually surpass it. But Chinese industrial espionage is targeting a wide range of other sectors too.According to Ray Wang, founder and CEO of Silicon Valley-based consultancy Constellation Research, they include pharmaceutical development and nanotechnology - engineering and technology conducted at the nanoscale for use in areas such as medicine, textiles and fabrics and automobiles. A nanometre is a billionth of a meter. It also includes pharmaceuticals, bioengineering - mimicking biological processes for purposes such as the development of biocompatible prostheses and regenerative tissue growth.Mr Wang cited an anecdote by a former head of research and development for a Fortune 100 company, who told him that ""the person he entrusted the most"" - someone so close that their children grew up together - was eventually found to be on the payroll of the Chinese Communist Party.""He kindly explained to me that the spies are everywhere,"" he said. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, China needs technological knowhow to power its economy and its challenge to the geopolitical orderIn the past industrial espionage from countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore was a concern, Mr Marro said. However once indigenous firms emerge as innovative market leaders in their own right - and so start to want to protect their own intellectual property - then their governments start passing legislation to take the issue more seriously. ""As Chinese firms have become more innovative over the past decade, we´ve seen a marked strengthening of domestic intellectual property rights protection in tandem,"" Mr Marro said.China has also gained expertise by making foreign companies hand over technology under joint venture agreements in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Despite complaints the Chinese government has always denied accusations of coercion. Hacking deal a ´joke´There have been attempts to rein in hacking specifically.In 2015 the US and China struck a deal in which both sides pledged not to carry out ""cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage"".By the following year, the US National Security Agency had accused the Chinese of violating the agreement, although it did acknowledge that the quantity of attempts to hack government and corporate data had dropped ""dramatically"". But observers say the deal´s overall impact has been minimal. Mr Wang said it was a ""joke"" due to a lack of enforcement. Chinese cyber-espionage in the US has been ""pervasive"" and extends to academic labs. ""It has been going on in every aspect of Western businesses,"" he told the BBC. However Lim Tai Wei from the National University of Singapore noted that there were no ""definitive uncontested studies"" on the extent of the phenomenon.""Some believe that there was a short dip in Chinese cyber espionage against the US, but resumed its former level thereafter. Others believe it failed due to the overall breakdown in US-China relations,"" he said.Meanwhile the US is now directly trying to block China´s progress in the key semiconductor industry - vital for everything from smartphones to weapons of war - saying China´s use of the technology poses a national security threat.In October, Washington announced some of the broadest export controls yet, requiring licences for companies exporting chips to China using US tools or software, no matter where they are made in the world. Washington´s measures also prevent US citizens and green card holders from working for certain Chinese chip companies. Green card holders are US permanent residents who have the right to work in the country.The US is beating China in the battle for chipsMr Marro says that while these measures will slow China´s technological advance, they will also accelerate China´s efforts to remove US and other foreign products from its tech supply chains. ""China has been trying to do this for years, with muted success, but these policy goals now command greater urgency as a result of the recent US controls,"" he said.  With China also invoking its own national security, the scramble for a technological edge between the world´s two biggest economies is only likely to intensify further.But Mr Wang reckons that the US still holds the advantage. ""My cyber-security friends tell me when they hack Chinese sites, the only worthwhile tech [they can find there] is US intellectual property,"" he said.Related TopicsSpyingChinaUnited StatesChina-US relationsTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

Last December, they clashed in what some experts saw as a worrying sign of how things could escalate.Tawang, a pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhists perched some 3,000m (10,000ft) above sea level, is home to India´s largest Buddhist monastery. For this reason and because of its strategic location, it´s long been the focus of tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.The town is claimed by China. Tibet, annexed by China in 1950, lies just 35km (22 miles) to the north. ""It´s not just the Tawang sector,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People´s Liberation Army, told the BBC. ""The entire Arunachal Pradesh [state], which we call southern Tibet, has been illegally occupied by India - it´s non-negotiable.""Image caption, December´s clash is reported to have taken place not far from Chumi Gyatse waterfall near the borderTawang hit the headlines in December after the first clashes there in years. India said Chinese soldiers encroached into its territory and ""unilaterally tried to change the status quo"". China said its troops were on routine patrol on their side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which separates Chinese and Indian held territory, and had been ""blocked by the Indian army illegally crossing the line"".  The fight that ensued reportedly left several soldiers injured on both sides. It followed a far more serious clash in 2020 at the other end of the disputed frontier. In a mass brawl in Ladakh´s Galwan valley, 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed - it was the first fatal confrontation over the border in 45 years and highlighted the risks faced as the rivals try to further their strategic goals. Image caption, With special permits, India allows domestic tourists all the way up to Bum La Pass, on the border with ChinaSince then, tensions have escalated, with both sides deploying tens of thousands of troops with heavy armaments along the disputed border. Claims are being reinforced in other ways too. In mid-February India announced plans to invest in more than 660 ""vibrant villages"" to encourage locals near the border to stay. The move was seen as a response to reports of model villages on China´s side.India is also promoting tourism in Arunachal Pradesh with hotels, restaurants and home-stays springing up in Tawang and surrounding areas. India and China share a frontier that isn´t fully demarcated, and have overlapping territorial claims. India says it is 3,488km long; China puts it at around 2,000km.Of all the disputed areas, Tawang remains high up on China´s list of claims.It was among areas taken during a brief war in 1962 that ended in a humiliating defeat for India. Thousands of PLA troops overran Indian positions before withdrawing.""Tawang is indispensable to China. The Tibetan spiritual leader the sixth Dalai Lama was born there [in the 17th Century],"" said Mr Zhou, who attended India-China border talks as a military expert in the mid-1990s. ""What better evidence do you need to prove that it´s Chinese territory?""India asserts its boundary claim based on the 1914 McMahon line, named after the British foreign secretary of colonial India.China refuses to accept the line - it runs from the east of Bhutan across the Himalayas and puts the whole of Arunachal Pradesh on the Indian side. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Indian troops being inspected in the Ladakh region during the 1962 war with ChinaFor China, Tawang offers an entry point to Arunachal Pradesh and the rest of India´s north-east.Some experts think Beijing wants to bring Buddhist holy sites, like Tawang, under its control to cement its authority over Tibet. When the current Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, he reached Tawang first after crossing mountains by foot. There´s also suspicion among some Chinese observers that given the ethnic link between the cross-border communities, Tawang could be used to whip up any future Tibetan uprising.India and China race to build along a tense frontierChina and India face off on the roof of the worldImages ´show China structures´ on India borderChina´s claims to Arunachal Pradesh have become more assertive over the past 20 years, but it appears it´s been willing to trade.Liu Zongyi, a senior fellow at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, says Tawang was central to a deal China offered India during talks in 2006.""On the premise of recovering Tawang, China was willing to give up its claim for sovereignty over most parts of southern Tibet [Arunachal Pradesh]… in exchange for India´s recognition of China´s sovereignty and control over Aksai Chin,"" Mr Liu told the BBC.He said the offer didn´t succeed because India hadn´t been willing to give up its interests in the east, especially over Tawang, and was also not ready to make concessions on Aksai Chin - currently under Chinese control.Image source, AFPImage caption, A Chinese soldier stands guard at the poorly demarcated border, which stretches several thousand kilometresShyam Saran, India´s foreign secretary at that time, said he didn´t remember any such proposal.""We never got down to any bargaining on how much territory you are willing to give up, how much territory we are willing to trade off. That stage never came up,"" Mr Saran said.Border negotiations have continued in the years since, but made no progress. The two sides met in Beijing in February for their first in-person talks in three years.India´s official position remains maintaining the status quo until a final settlement, but Chinese observers are wary.Mr Zhou, the former PLA officer, says Indian intransigence has generated suspicion.""In China there are some people who say the Indian attitude is like - mine is mine and yours is also mine. They believe that as India is in control of the eastern sector, therefore they are trying their best to grab more land in the west in Ladakh,"" Mr Zhou said. According to Mr Liu, India has over decades adopted an ""offensive defence policy, constantly encroaching on Chinese territory across the LAC and occupying the military commanding heights in the border areas"".Image source, AFPImage caption, Indian troops near the Line of Actual Control in Tawang sectorSuch remarks mirror criticisms of China´s approach to territory that India regards as its own. ""The Chinese keep moving the goal posts or shifting their position,"" says Mr Saran.With both sides showing little flexibility, Mr Zhou thinks resolving the border dispute should be left to the future.But many in India feel a delay could only be advantageous to China, which has vastly increased its military and economic might in the last few decades.""As the power asymmetry between the two sides keeps growing, I think we should expect a much more assertive China,"" said Mr Saran.No one expects a war to break out anytime soon, given how much India and China value their strong trade relations. But neither shows any sign of compromise. As both sides vie for control on the ground, clashes like the recent one near Tawang only become more likely - all it would need is a spark for things to flare up.BBC News India is now on YouTube.

It was a ""clear violation of Philippine sovereign rights"" in waters that Manila refers to as the West Philippine Sea, the Filipino coastguard said in a statement.Aside from flashing laser light twice, the Chinese ship also made ""dangerous manoeuvres"" about 150 yards (137m) from the Filipino ship´s starboard side, authorities said.A spokesperson for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declined to comment to the BBC. There was no immediate comment from Beijing.In 2016, the UN´s Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that Beijing´s sweeping claims in the South China Sea have no historical basis.Tensions over the shoal - known as Ayungin in the Philippines - was one of the catalysts for the case, which was brought by the Philippines.However, the tribunal has no powers to enforce its ruling and China has continued to build giant structures over reefs in the waters - which are also disputed in part by Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte also refused to flaunt the arbitration ruling and instead sought to repair political and economic ties between Manila and Beijing as he pivoted the country away from its long-standing ally, the US.Mr Marcos, however, reversed the pivot. Earlier this month, his government agreed to grant the US access to four additional military bases.In June last year, a Chinese navy vessel flashed blue lights and blinkers at a Philippine coastguard tugboat, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported.That incident came six months after Australia accused China of shining a military grade laser towards one of its warplanes off northern Australia.Related TopicsChinaPhilippinesLasersTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

Mr Lukashenko and Mr Xi´s meeting also coincided with a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Central Asian nations to discuss the Ukraine war.On Wednesday, China and Belarus ""expressed deep concern"" about the conflict and ""extreme interest in the soonest possible establishment of peace in Ukraine"", the Belarus state-run news agency Belta reported.Mr Lukashenko has aided the Russian leader in his war in Ukraine, and observers have seen his trip to Beijing as another sign of China closing ranks with Russia and its allies.The Belarus leader praised China´s peace plan.The 12-point document urges respect for ""the sovereignty of all countries"". It does not specifically say Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine and condemns the usage of ""unilateral sanctions"", an implicit criticism of Ukraine´s Western allies.Mr Lukashenko said he ""fully supports the initiative on international security you have put forward"", according to remarks released by his aides.Political decisions ""should be aimed at first and foremost preventing a slide into a global confrontation that will see no winners"", he told Mr Xi.China´s peace plan was met with general distrust in the West.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he agreed with some parts of it and said it was a sign of China´s willingness to engage. Beijing has so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky´s call for a summit. Zelensky wants to meet China´s Xi to discuss peace planThe Chinese leader called for discarding ""all Cold War mentality"", according to a Chinese readout of the meeting with Mr Lukashenko.Mr Xi added that countries ""should stop politicising"" the world economy and to ""do things that will aid a ceasefire, cessation of war, and a peaceful resolution"".Mr Lukashenko´s three-day visit comes after China upgraded the status of its relationship with Belarus in September, several months into the Ukraine war.Chinese foreign ministry statements have described their ties as an ""all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership"", a rare term that has been used for only one other country - Pakistan.This means Belarus ranks very highly in China´s hierarchy of international relationships, just below Russia, according to a BBC Monitoring analysis. Belarus has been a key ally for Russia from the very beginning of the conflict when it allowed Moscow to use the Belarusian border with Ukraine as a launchpad for an attack on Kyiv, which eventually failed.China, meanwhile, has attempted to appear neutral by stating support for both sovereignty and the right to national security, which are Ukraine and Russia´s respective interests.But Beijing has also refused to condemn Moscow and supported their war effort in indirect ways. Chinese state media has actively propagated Russian´s view on the war, according to multiple analyses. The Chinese government strongly rejected claims made by the United States last week that it was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia. ""We do not accept the United States´ finger-pointing on China-Russia relations, let alone coercion and pressure,"" China´s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said when asked about the allegations.Chinese firms are also accused of supplying dual-use technology - goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as drones and semi-conductor chips - to Russia.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsWednesday´s visit took place as the US made its own diplomatic push, with Mr Blinken touring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

Countries across Central Asia understand this,"" he said.All five Central Asian countries are former members of the Soviet Union who have trade ties with Russia and China. But they have largely remained neutral during the war, adhered to Western sanctions and expressed unease at Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, also an ex-Soviet state.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warBelarusAsiaChinaRussiaUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64809777,02,03,2023

Now Beijing has given its firmest response yet - and it´s not something many in the West would like.In recent days, China has launched an assertive charm offensive, kicking off with top diplomat Wang Yi´s tour of Europe, which culminated in a warm welcome by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Beijing has released not one but two position papers - the first offering the Chinese solution to the war, and the other outlining a plan for world peace. These largely retread China´s talking points from the past year, calling for respect for sovereignty (for Ukraine) and the protection of national security interests (for Russia), while opposing the use of unilateral sanctions (by the US). The West may come away unimpressed - but convincing them was never likely the main goal for Beijing.China´s goal: send a clear message to USFirstly, it clearly seeks to position itself as a global peacemaker. An obvious clue about who it´s really trying to charm lies in one of its papers, where it mentions engaging South East Asia, Africa and South America - the so-called Global South. In preaching an alternative vision to a US-led world order, it is wooing the rest of the globe, which is watching to see how the West handles the Ukraine crisis.But another goal is to send a clear message to the US. ""There is an element of defiance,"" said Alexander Korolev, an expert in Sino-Russian ties at the University of New South Wales. ""It is signalling: ´If things get ugly between us, I have someone to go to. Russia is not alone, which means that I will not be alone when there is a confrontation… don´t get comfortable in bullying me.´""The timing, say observers, is a giveaway. Relations between the US and China have hit a new low, exacerbated by the spy balloon saga. Some have also questioned why China - if its intention is to help end the war - is only just now making its big diplomatic push for Ukraine peace.""China had ample opportunities to display leadership, it was invited early on to contribute to ending the war… If the goal was to truly display the image of a global leader, you don´t have to sit on the fence for one year and try to perform a diplomatic dance,"" said Dr Korolev.There was a third goal, and it could be seen in Mr Wang´s itinerary. By visiting France, Germany, Italy and Hungary, whose leaders China perceives as taking less of a hardline stance on Russia, Mr Wang may have been testing the waters to see if China could lure some of Europe into China´s orbit.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsBeijing sees a ""logical convergence of interests"" with these countries, said Zhang Xin, an international political economy expert with the East China Normal University in Shanghai. ""It believes the US has hegemonic power, and that a large part of the Transatlantic world could benefit from detaching from that system.""But whether China will succeed in that particular goal is questionable. Mr Wang´s speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he criticised the US, did not play well in a roomful of America´s staunchest allies and, according to diplomats, only spawned greater distrust of China´s true motives.His tour ""was a very overt push to say: ´We don´t have problems with Europe, we have problems with the US, we can fix things with you Europeans and you need to understand that the US is leading you down a problematic road´"", said Andrew Small, a senior fellow specialising in Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank.""But I think in most places in Europe, this message doesn´t have much traction.""Zelensky wants to meet Xi Jinping to discuss peace planThe key question now is whether Beijing will live up to its word of making peace as it tightens its embrace of Russia. The US has warned this week that China was considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia, and that Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.Publicly China has reacted with angry rhetoric. But behind closed doors, Mr Wang made it clear to top EU official Josep Borrell that it will not provide weapons to Russia.Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Mr Wang in MoscowAccording to Mr Borrell, Mr Wang had also asked: ""Why do you show concern for me maybe providing arms to Russia when you are providing arms to Ukraine?"" It is a revealing line, say observers, showing that Beijing still truly believes the West is to blame for fuelling the war. ""Sending weapons to any warring party is considered as further escalation - that is the position of the Chinese state so far,"" said Dr Zhang.There is scepticism that Beijing would supply weapons to Moscow, given how it runs counter to Chinese interests.Such a move would be seen by others as a clear escalation of the war, and would lead to sanctions and disruption of trade with the West - hugely damaging for China, as the EU and US are among its top trading partners. It would also raise global tensions significantly and likely push US allies further into Washington´s embrace, stymieing Beijing´s plan to woo some of them away. What is more likely to happen, say observers, is that Beijing will continue or even step up indirect support to Russia, such as boosting economic trade - which has provided a financial lifeline to Moscow - and abstaining from sanctions on Russia.What support is China giving Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?They may even supply more dual-use technology through third party states such as Iran or North Korea, according to Dr Small, so that they can lend support ""as deniably as possible"".But as the war drags on, the issue of giving lethal weapons will resurface, he warned. ""There hasn´t been a question yet on what kind of significant things China could be asked to do, because previously Russia didn´t need to resupply,"" said Dr Small. ""But they are hitting that juncture. How long is China willing to say to Russia it will not do it?""Days before the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin declared they had a ""friendship without limits"". A year on, China will have to answer the question of how far it would go for its special friend.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warAsiaChinaRussiaUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64754510,24,02,2023

It was last spotted over Missouri.It is expected to reach America´s east coast near the Carolinas this weekend.The US has decided not to shoot down the high-altitude airship due to the danger of falling debris.The incident comes amid fraying tensions between the US and China.High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesWas China balloon blown off course?Why use a spy balloon instead of satellites?In a statement on Saturday, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing ""never violated the territory and airspace of any sovereign country"".It said its senior foreign policy official Wang Yi had discussed the incident with Mr Blinken over the phone, stressing that maintaining communication channels at all levels was important, ""especially in dealing with some unexpected situations in a calm and reliable manner"". It added that Beijing ""would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype"" and accused ""some politicians and media in the United States"" of using the incident ""as a pretext to attack and smear China.""According to US officials, the airship floated over Alaska and Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.The incident angered top US officials, with Mr Blinken saying he had told Beijing the balloon´s presence was ""a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law"" and ""an irresponsible act"". He called it ""unacceptable"" and ""even more irresponsible coming on the eve of a long-planned visit"".America´s top diplomat had been set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.

The Japanese military used them to launch incendiary bombs in the US during World War Two. They were also widely used by the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.More recently, the US has reportedly been considering adding high-altitude inflatables into the Pentagon´s surveillance network. Modern balloons typically hover between 24km-37km above the earth´s surface (80,000ft-120,000ft).""Beijing is probably trying to signal to Washington: ´While we want to improve ties, we are also ever ready for sustained competition, using any means necessary,´ without severely inflaming tensions,""  independent air-power analyst He Yuan Ming told the BBC. ""And what better tool for this than a seemingly innocuous balloon?""The balloon´s anticipated flight path near certain missile bases suggests it is unlikely it has drifted off course, He Yuan Ming said.How China sneaks out America´s technology secretsThe US wants to play in China´s backyardWas China balloon blown off course?High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesThe US Department of Defence on Thursday said the balloon is ""significantly above where civilian air traffic is active"". But China expert Benjamin Ho said Beijing had more sophisticated surveillance technology at its disposal. ""They have other means to spy out American infrastructure, or whatever information they wanted to obtain. The balloon was to send a signal to the Americans, and also to see how the Americans would react,"" explained Dr Ho - coordinator of the China programme at Singapore´s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.It may even be the case that China wanted the US to detect the balloon. ""It´s possible that being spotted was the whole point. China might be using the balloon to demonstrate that it has a sophisticated technological capability to penetrate US airspace without risking a serious escalation. In this regard, a balloon is a pretty ideal choice,"" said Arthur Holland Michel from the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.Nevertheless, the experts point out that balloons can be fitted with modern technology like spy cameras and radar sensors, and there are some advantages to using balloons for surveillance - chief of which is that it is less expensive and easier to deploy than drones or satellites. The balloon´s slower speed also allows it to loiter over and monitor the target area for longer periods. A satellite´s movement, on the other hand, is restricted to its orbital pass.Related TopicsAsiaChinaSurveillanceUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64508086,03,02,2023

In a speech in Tokyo, she urged countries to send a message to Beijing that ""military aggression towards Taiwan would be a strategic mistake"". It was her first public speech since she resigned in October. Her successor Rishi Sunak has said China should be dealt with through ""robust pragmatism"". Ms Truss, who was previously foreign secretary, put forward a number of policy recommendations for countries to support Taiwan, including reducing reliance on China in key industries, deepening economic ties with Taiwan, and accepting the self-ruled island into international organisations. She also called for a more developed Pacific defence alliance so that Taiwan ""is able to defend itself"", and closer cooperation with Nato. She added that ""countries should find a way to elevate Taiwan´s status"". China and Taiwan: A really simple guideGolden era of UK-China relations over, says SunakHer speech was organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international campaign group that focuses on how democratic countries approach China. The Japanese government said this week it would review its defence policy in the wake of the alleged Chinese spy balloon episode in the US. Asked about Ms Truss´s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said: ""I have yet to see the speech. But we are against distorting facts about China.""He added: ""The Taiwan question is China´s domestic affair. Allegations of economic coercion from China are unfounded.""  ´Warnings ignored´ China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually come under its control, while Taiwan views itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders. Chinese President Xi Jinping has said ""reunification"" with Taiwan ""must be fulfilled"", and has not ruled out using force to achieve this aim. Ms Truss said the UK´s previous approach of cultivating a close relationship with Beijing was a mistake, and that the UK had ""ignored too many warning signs"", including the Uyghur detention camps, as well as the ""disgraceful dismantling of one country, two systems in Hong Kong"". ""Since it was the free world which enabled China´s rise, it must be the free world which challenges its economic dominance before it´s too late,"" she said. She said President Xi had ""been very clear"" in his ambition to ""have control of Taiwan"", and called on democratic countries to help protect Taiwan´s status as ""a beacon of freedom in the world"". ""We must learn from the past. We must ensure that Taiwan is able to defend itself, and we must work together across the free world to do this,"" she said. Her successor as prime minister, Mr Sunak, is facing pressure from some of his own MPs to take a tougher line on China. In November, he said the so-called ""golden era"" of relations with China was over and the closer economic ties of the previous decade had been ""naïve"".But he stressed ""we cannot simply ignore China´s significance in world affairs - to global economic stability or issues like climate change"".Related TopicsLiz TrussChinaTaiwan",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64674425,17,02,2023

China has said it will fully reopen its borders on 8 January.Several countries, including the US, France and India, have imposed testing.The Department of Health and Social Care said people travelling from China on direct flights from 5 January will be asked to take a pre-departure Covid test.From 8 January, the UK Health Security Agency will also launch surveillance, which will see a sample of passengers arriving from China tested for the virus as they arrive.Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the government was taking a ""balanced and precautionary approach"", adding the measures were ""temporary"" as officials assess the latest Covid data.The testing requirement only applies to people flying to English airports, with the government saying that while there are no direct flights from China to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, it is working with the devolved administrations to ensure the policy is applied UK-wide.China must share Covid data, says WHOSpain, South Korea and Israel tighten Covid testing rulesReality Check: Do restrictions on travel work against Covid? The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on Beijing to share ""real-time"" information on Covid - including on deaths, hospitalisations and vaccinations.The UN body said it was willing to offer support on data-sharing, adding that it was ""understandable"" that some countries were now imposing fresh restrictions. China´s foreign ministry said earlier this week that its ""epidemic situation"" overall was ""predictable and under control"". The Chinese government is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.The true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths.The UK government said its decision was due to a ""lack of comprehensive health information shared by China"".Spain, Israel and South Korea also announced on Friday that they will introduce testing requirements in response to the increasing number of infections in China.Some scientists have questioned the approach of the UK and US - saying it is better to screen people once they have arrived. Italy and Spain have introduced post-arrival testing. But not all countries have announced additional controls. Germany has joined Australia and Portugal in saying there will be no new rules yet.Concerns over impact of testing Prof Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the restrictions are unlikely to prevent new Covid variants reaching the UK and it was difficult to know what impact such a move would have here. He told BBC News: ""Trying to ban a virus by adjusting what we do with travel has already been shown not to work very well.""We´ve seen that with the bans on travel from various countries during the pandemic, that hasn´t stopped those viruses travelling around the world eventually.""But there is concern that more infections can provide more opportunities for the virus to mutate. Countries that plan to test travellers say the policy will help spot worrying new variants early and prevent an influx of cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said testing visitors from China, Hong Kong and Macau was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"".The government had also come under pressure from Conservative MPs who want a more robust response.The new requirement for travellers from China to provide negative tests was welcomed by Tory MP Steve Brine, chairman of the Commons health and social care committee.He told BBC Radio 4´s Today programme that the move would reduce the number of passengers with infections, and help to identify new variants of the disease.But he said the policy was not about trying to ""ban a virus"" - adding that ministers were not trying to repeat the ""Beijing folly of an unattainable zero-Covid policy"".Related TopicsTravelUK governmentChinaCoronavirus testingCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64130655,31,12,2022

In a statement they admitted the object belonged to them, but added it was a ""civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes"" that had been blown off-course.Taking a near-apologetic tone - rare for Beijing - they characterised it as an accident, saying they ""regretted the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure"".But state media, which had mostly held off from reporting the story until the government´s admission, got more defensive.China Daily claimed the ""fabricated balloon lie cannot be tied down to China"", while the Global Times urged the US ""to be more sincere in fixing relations with China instead of making provocative actions against it"".Netizens wasted no time in making jokes about the incident, with many calling the object ""The Wandering Balloon"" - a reference to the popular Chinese science-fiction novel and film The Wandering Earth.The morning after, Chinese authorities released a longer, more vigorous defence as news broke that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had called off a planned trip to China, claiming that ""some politicians and media in the US have hyped it up to attack and smear China"".That same day, the US shot the balloon down - prompting Chinese ire.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning called it a ""a clear overreaction"" and ""unacceptable and irresponsible"". ""The airship does not belong to the US. It belongs to China,"" she said, when asked if China had requested for the balloon´s remnants to be returned. Officials lodged a formal complaint with the US embassy in Beijing, and China´s Defence Ministry said they ""reserved the right to use necessary means to deal with similar situations"".Online, Chinese nationalists indignantly denounced the US. Prominent commentator Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of Global Times, thought the US ""had to end"" the situation by using a missile, because Americans ""aren´t able to treat an accident by seeking truth from facts, instead they had to politicise it"".Meanwhile, a second balloon was spotted drifting over Latin America, which Chinese authorities also admitted was theirs.Speculation mountsOn the Chinese internet there was fevered speculation about who exactly had launched the balloon, in the absence of details about its civilian origins.Many seized upon recent news articles that mentioned a local company, ChemChina Zhuzhou Rubber Research and Design Institute, as one of the main producers of high-altitude balloons in China.Some bloggers claimed ChemChina Zhuzhou, a subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise, had made the balloon. But there has been no evidence linking the company to the airship.The confusion deepened on Sunday, when a report came out in news outlet The Paper about an unidentified object allegedly flying off the coast of the eastern Shandong province.It said fisheries officials had sent out a warning to local fishermen that Chinese authorities were preparing to shoot down the object.  The report was reproduced by some Chinese outlets, but state media and government departments remained silent. It sent social media into overdrive nonetheless, with some accounts even live streaming satellite images of the area. But some online reacted with suspicion and asked if it was real, questioning why the news had not been announced on more official channels.Turning the narrativeOn Monday, the Chinese government had a new claim - that US balloons had breached their airspace at least 10 times in the past year.""The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman. The US has denied the accusation.Chinese balloon sensors recovered from ocean, says USChina´s foreign affairs committee on Thursday issued a formal condemnation of US lawmakers´ response to the balloon as ""purely malicious hype and political manipulation"".""In fact, it is the United States that wantonly interferes in other countries´ internal affairs, violates their sovereignty, and conducts surveillance on other countries,"" the committee´s resolution said.At the same time, state media has begun focusing on a different narrative - a derailed train carrying hazardous material in Ohio.Though the incident happened in early February, Chinese news outlets are now devoting significant coverage on the topic, citing US media reports. US officials have performed a controlled release of toxic chemicals from the train to prevent contamination.It has since become a significant talking point on social media. On Weibo, China´s equivalent to Twitter, the main Ohio train hashtag has been viewed more than 690 million times since the weekend, with more than 40 hashtags created on the topic.Many Chinese netizens have expressed worry that the incident would turn into a global environmental crisis, and anger over the relatively sparser coverage of the train incident in US media compared to the balloons.""Turns out the Wandering Balloon was being used to take the heat for Ohio,"" a post liked nearly 3,000 times reads.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsRelated TopicsChinaSurveillanceUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64633990,16,02,2023

The population in 2022 - 1.4118 billion - fell by 850,000 from 2021.China´s birth rate has been declining for years, prompting a slew of policies to try to slow the trend. But seven years after scrapping the one-child policy, it has entered what one official described as an ""era of negative population growth"". The birth rate in 2022 was also down from 7.52 in 2021, according to China´s National Bureau of Statistics, which released the figures on Tuesday. In comparison, in 2021, the United States recorded 11.06 births per 1,000 people, and the United Kingdom, 10.08 births. The birth rate for the same year in India, which is poised to overtake China as the world´s most populous country, was 16.42.Deaths also outnumbered births for the first time last year in China. The country logged its highest death rate since 1976 - 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, up from 7.18 the previous year.Why don´t Chinese women want more babies?What it will mean when Indians outnumber ChineseDoes China´s ´one-child generation´ want more kids?Earlier government data had heralded a demographic crisis, which would in the long run shrink China´s labour force and increase the burden on healthcare and other social security costs. Results from a once-a-decade census announced in 2021 showed China´s population growing at its slowest pace in decades. Populations are also shrinking and ageing in other East Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea.   ""This trend is going to continue and perhaps worsen after Covid,"" says Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ms Su is among experts who expect China´s population to shrink further through 2023. ""The high youth unemployment rate and weaknesses in income expectations could delay marriage and childbirth plans further, dragging down the number of newborns,"" she added. And the death rate in 2023 is likely to be higher than it was pre-pandemic due to Covid infections, she said. China has seen a surge of cases since it abandoned its zero-Covid policy last month. China´s population trends over the years have been largely shaped by the controversial one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules were fined and, in some cases, even lost jobs. In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, the policy had also led to forced abortions and a reportedly skewed gender ratio from the 1980s.The policy was scrapped in 2016 and married couples were allowed to have two children. In recent years, the Chinese government also offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare, among other incentives, to reverse, or at least slow, the falling birth rate. But these policies did not lead to a sustained increase in the births. Some experts say this is because policies that encouraged childbirth were not accompanied by efforts to ease the burden of childcare, such as more help for working mothers or access to education. In October 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping made boosting birth rates a priority. Mr Xi said in a once-in-five-year Communist Party Congress in Beijing that his government would ""pursue a proactive national strategy"" in response to the country´s ageing population.Apart from dishing out incentives to have children, China should also improve gender equality in households and workplaces, said Bussarawan Teerawichitchainan, director of the National University of Singapore´s Centre for Family and Population Research. BBC Future: Are there too many people? Scandinavian countries have shown that such moves can improve fertility rates, she added. According to Paul Cheung, Singapore´s former chief statistician, China has ""plenty of manpower"" and ""a lot of lead time"" to manage the demographic challenge. ""They are not in a doomsday scenario right away,"" he said.Observers also say merely raising birth rates will not resolve the problems behind China´s slowing growth.""Boosting fertility is not going to improve productivity or increase domestic consumption in the medium term,"" said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a public policy professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""How China will respond to these structural issues would be more crucial.""

The board added it was not aware of ""any information that indicates that Mr Bao´s unavailability is or might be related to the business and/or operations of the group"".When asked for further comment, China Renaissance referred the BBC to its notice to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company did not specify how long Mr Bao had been missing. Chinese business newswire Caixin cited sources saying staff had not been able to contact him for two days.The business wire also reported the firm´s president, Cong Lin, had been taken by authorities last September over his previous work at the state-owned ICBC bank. China Renaissance appears to not have commented on Mr Cong´s situation. He is no longer listed as an executive on the company´s site or in its most recent interim report.The disappearance of Mr Bao - one of China´s leading tech investors - has again evoked a history of Chinese executives suddenly vanishing for periods of time with no explanation.At least half a dozen billionaires in the past few years have disappeared for periods after reported run-ins with the Communist Party, according to Forbes Magazine.In several cases they were suspected to have been ensnared in corruption, tax or other misconduct investigations.Notable absences include that of Fosun group founder Guo Guangchang, who has been called the Warren Buffet of China, who vanished for several days in 2015. Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua was also taken in 2017. He had been one of China´s richest people and last year was jailed for corruption.In late 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma also disappeared from public view for three months, after making comments critical of market regulators. He had been due to publicly list his digital payments firm Ant Financial - which would have most likely made him the richest man in China.Mr Bao is seen as a titan in China´s tech industry, having executed many of the trades that have shaped its online consumer economy. He founded China Renaissance in 2005 after a banking career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.His company was behind landmark deals including Tencent´s strategic investment in JD.com, and mergers of ride-hailing power players Didi and Kuaidi, advert sites 58.com and Ganji, and food delivery giants Meituan and Dianping.China Renaissance has also advised the initial public offerings of e-commerce sites JD.com and Kuashou, as well as Didi´s listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.In a 2018 article, Mr Bao wrote that his company had ""cross paths"" with 70% of the internet companies known by the Chinese public.Related TopicsChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64672095,17,02,2023

He will help manage China´s maritime and land boundaries. It is unclear when he took up his new role.A high profile figure, Mr Zhao often hosted the ministry´s media briefings.The reason for his unexpected transfer is unclear. He was considered the leading light of ""Wolf Warrior"" diplomacy, defined by its confrontational, combative approach, a stark contrast to the previously restrained brand of Chinese diplomacy.It is named after the highly popular, often jingoistic, movie franchise about the adventures of a Chinese special forces soldier.In three years as foreign ministry spokesman Mr Zhao often courted controversy with his tweets. In 2020, Mr Zhao suggested that the coronavirus which causes Covid was manufactured by the US military and brought to China. That same year, he set off a diplomatic furore when he posted a doctored image of an Australian soldier killing an Afghan child.The year before, former US national security adviser Susan Rice called the 50-year-old a ""racist disgrace"" after he fired off a series of provocative tweets about race relations in the US. Mr Zhao´s reassignment coincides with China´s former ambassador to the US Qin Gang becoming China´s new foreign minister.However some observers have cautioned against seeing Mr Zhao´s move as signifying that China was moving away from combative diplomacy. Writing on his Sinocism blog, US journalist Bill Bishop said the approach appeared to be a ""fundamental tenet"" of leader Xi Jinping´s style of diplomacy and while Mr Zhao was ""one of the cruder mouthpieces"" there was no evidence so far of any broader shift.China’s new brand of tough-talking diplomatsThe nationalist action film storming ChinaSome internet users have also speculated that the social media posts of Mr Zhao´s wife Tang Tianru may have something to do with his apparent demotion. Multiple photos of Ms Tang apparently attending public events in Beijing without a mask were posted on the account at a time when China was subject to the strictest Covid curbs in the world. Pictures also purportedly showed Ms Tang travelling in Germany despite the travel restrictions then in force.Last November, Mr Zhao was uncharacteristically caught at a loss for words when asked in a press conference whether China would continue its zero-Covid policies amid rare protests in the country. After a long pause, he asked for the question to be repeated before saying that the query did ""not reflect what actually happened"".The role of foreign ministry spokesperson is considered to be a prominent role that has in the past led to further promotion. China´s newly-appointed foreign minister Mr Qin served as spokesperson before he was promoted inside the ministry and then given the prestigious US ambassadorship.Meanwhile Mr Zhao´s ex-colleague Hua Chunying, who has been a spokesperson since 2012, was promoted to assistant minister of foreign affairs in 2021.Related TopicsChinaTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

In recent days, the US has also shot down a number of other unidentified objects.Questioned on Monday, Beijing said the US had made many airspace breaches.""It´s not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a regular press briefing.""Since last year alone, US balloons have illegally flown above China more than 10 times without any approval from Chinese authorities.""""The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,"" he added.He said Beijing had responded to the incursions in a ""responsible and professional"" manner. ""If you want to know more about US high-altitude balloons illegally entering China´s airspace, I suggest you refer to the US side,"" he said.Chinese state-affiliated media reported over the weekend that an unidentified flying object had been spotted off the country´s east coast, with the military preparing to shoot it down.The White House denied Beijing´s accusation that it sent balloons over China to conduct surveillance, with National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson calling the claims ""false"" on Twitter.The first balloon incident led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned trip to Beijing. The top diplomat called China´s alleged high-altitude spying ""unacceptable and irresponsible"".On Sunday, the US ordered an unmanned ""octagonal structure"" to be downed in Michigan near the Canadian border - the fourth object to be taken out in eight days.Fighter pilots also shot down smaller unidentified objects over Alaska on 10 February and northern Canada on 11 February.Mr Wang said he had ""no understanding of [these other objects]"".""But what we want to tell everyone here is that the US´ frequent firing of advanced missiles used to strike down unidentified flying objects is an overreaction of excessive force,"" he said.A US military commander, General Glen VanHerck, said that there was no indication of any threat from the latest object. He said it could be a ""gaseous type of balloon"" or ""some type of a propulsion system"" - adding he could not rule out that the objects were extra-terrestrials.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to keep the country safe from the threat of spy balloons.""We have something called the quick reaction alert force which involves Typhoon planes, which are kept on 24/7 readiness to police our airspace, which is incredibly important,"" he added.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China rowRelated TopicsChinaCommunist Party of ChinaDiplomacyUnited StatesChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64621598,13,02,2023

The US, India and the UK are among the nations that have introduced mandatory testing for arrivals from China. The country has recently seen a surge in Covid cases following the easing of its strict controls. And there are fears that cases and deaths are being vastly underreported. China´s last daily Covid update, on 24 December, reported fewer than 5,000 cases - but some analysts claim the daily caseload is already over two million, and could peak at almost four million this month.A lack of data - and China´s announcement that it was easing curbs on travel from 8 January - led to more than a dozen countries announcing Covid testing on arrivals from China.The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged China to share more real-time information and a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry on Tuesday said that Beijing was willing to ""improve communication with the world"".However, spokeswoman Mao Ning said the government was ""firmly opposed to attempts to manipulate the epidemic prevention and control measures for political purposes, and will take corresponding measures...according to the principle of reciprocity.""China´s borders have been largely closed since March 2020 - meaning few foreigners were able to enter and those that did had to undergo rigorous testing and quarantine. The European Union´s disease prevention agency and Australia´s Chief Medical Officer have both argued that high levels of vaccination and immunity reduce the threat that Covid poses. But despite that, countries - including some in the EU - have imposed testing for Chinese arrivals.""I think we´re performing our duty in protecting French people by asking for tests,"" France´s Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Tuesday.""We´re doing it while respecting the rules of the World Health Organization and we will continue to do it.""The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, has said an overwhelming number of member states favour introducing travel restrictions. France, Italy and Spain have already introduced their own measures but a decision on whether that will be extended to all EU countries is expected on Wednesday. The US has also defended its testing requirements, saying that its approach is based ""solely and exclusively on science"". It´s not the first time that Beijing has been at odds with the international community over the virus. It was first detected in Wuhan in central China in late 2019 and the government resisted attempts to investigate the origins.Meanwhile, China has on Tuesday rejected an offer from the European Union to supply an unspecified number of Covid-19 vaccines to help deal with the surge in cases, saying it has an ""adequate supply"".Official data shows China has given more than 3.4 billion doses - the vast majority of which are CoronaVac. The government has so far insisted in using only Chinese-made vaccines, which have been proven to be less effective than other Western-developed mRNA vaccines against the Omicron variant.

Now the world´s two biggest economies are battling over another precious resource: semiconductors, the chips that literally power our daily life.These tiny fragments of silicon are at the heart of a $500bn industry that is expected to double by 2030. And whoever controls the supply chains - a tangled network of companies and countries that make the chips - holds the key to being an unrivalled superpower.China wants the technology to produce chips. That´s why the US, a source of much of the tech, is cutting Beijing off. The two countries are clearly engaged in an arms race in the Asia Pacific, says Chris Miller, author of Chip Wars and associate professor at Tufts University. But, he adds, there´s more to the race: ""[It] takes place both in traditional spheres, like numbers of ships, or missiles produced but increasingly, it´s taking place in terms of the quality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that can be employed in military systems."" For now, the US is winning - but the chip war it has declared on China is reshaping the global economy. The chip-makersThe manufacture of semiconductors is complex, specialist and deeply integrated. An iPhone has chips that are designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, then assembled in China. India, which is investing more in the industry, could play a bigger role in the future. Semiconductors were invented in the US, but over time East Asia emerged as a manufacturing hub, largely because of government incentives, including subsidies. This allowed Washington to develop business ties and strategic alliances in a region vulnerable to Russian influence during the Cold War. It´s just as useful now, in the face of Beijing´s growing influence in the Asia Pacific.The race is on to make the best and most efficient chips at scale - and the smaller, the better. The challenge: how many transistors - tiny electrical switches that can turn a current on or off - can you fit onto the smallest bit of a silicon wafer?""It´s what the semiconductor industry calls Moore´s law, essentially doubling the transistor density over time, and that´s a hard goal to achieve,"" said Jue Wang, a partner at Silicon Valley at Bain & Company.""It´s what enables our phones to get faster, our digital photo archive to get bigger, our smart home devices to get smarter over time and our social media content to get richer."" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Washington is trying to cut China off from the tech that makes chipsGetting there is not easy even for the top chip-makers. In mid-2022, Samsung became the first company to start mass producing three-nanometre chips at scale. Later that year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) - the world´s biggest chip-maker and a major supplier to Apple - followed. How narrow is that? Much narrower than a strand of human hair, which is about 50 to 100,000 nanometres. These smaller ""leading edge"" chips are more powerful, which means they go into more valuable devices - supercomputers and AI, the internet of things. The market for ""lagging edge"" chips - which power the more mundane bits of our lives, such as microwaves, washing machines and refrigerators - is lucrative too. But demand will likely wither in the future. Most of the world´s chips are currently being made in Taiwan, giving the self-ruled island what its President calls a ""silicon shield"" - in other words, protection from China, which claims the territory. Beijing too has made chip production a national priority and is investing aggressively in supercomputers and AI. It is nowhere near being a global leader but has been catching up quickly in the past decade, especially in its chip design capabilities, Mr Miller says. ""What you find historically is that whenever powerful countries have advanced computing technology, they deploy them to intelligence and military systems,"" he added.This, and the dependence on Taiwan and other Asian countries for supply, is rattling America. How is the US hobbling China´s progress?The Biden administration is trying to choke China´s access to the technology that makes chips.Last October, Washington announced sweeping export controls making it virtually impossible for companies to sell chips, chip-making equipment, and software containing US tech to China, no matter where they are based in the world. It also banned US citizens and permanent residents from supporting the ""development or production"" of chips at certain factories in China. How the US-China chip war is playing outUS tries to take on China with huge tech investmentThis hits China hard because it imports both the hardware and the talent that fuels its nascent chip-making industry. The Netherlands´ ASML stands to lose about a quarter of the revenue it used to earn from China. It´s the only company that makes the most advanced lithographic machines - the tools that make ""leading edge"" chips. ""Talent is so important in this area... if you look at the executives of China´s semiconductor companies, a lot of them hold American passports, they are trained in the US, and they have green cards. So that is a really big problem for China,"" says Linghao Bao, analyst at policy research firm Trivium China. The US also wants to make more chips. The Chips and Science Act offers $53bn of grants and subsidies to companies making semiconductors in the US. Major players are taking advantage of that. TSMC is investing in two plants worth $40 billion in the US, their only facilities outside of Taiwan.

Before the pandemic, it was the largest annual worldwide migration of people returning home to spend time with family. Two billion trips are expected to be made this Lunar New Year, double the number that travelled last year. Li Hua, who travelled from the UK to China - where her family lives - for the festival said it had been ""too long"" since she had returned, ""I´m so happy to be back, and breathe Chinese air. So happy, so happy"".Mark Clayton returned home to Zhuhai, in Guandong, with his wife and baby after visiting Hong Kong. He told the BBC his trip home had been ""nearly as smooth as it used to be pre-Covid"". ""We didn´t even show them the PCR, we simply scanned a code and put in a very quick customs declaration... And then straight through,"" he said. Young people in China self-infect as fears for elderly growChina under-representing Covid deaths, WHO warnsHow many Covid cases are there in China?But there is concern from some that opening the borders will result in more transmission of Covid-19. Some local bus drivers told the BBC they are worried they might get the virus from incoming travellers, and want their companies to provide them with more protection.Over the past three years, China had one of the world´s strictest Covid health policies that saw numerous lockdowns, frequent testing requirements and had a significant impact on the nation´s economy.The government recently walked back that policy after protests across the country, triggered by a fire in a high-rise block in the Xinjiang region that killed 10 people. Many Chinese believed the long-running Covid restrictions contributed to the deaths, but authorities denied this.Since China abandoned the key elements of its Covid zero policy there have been reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overwhelmed, but the country has stopped publishing its case numbers and reported only two deaths on Saturday.On the same day, the Chinese government banned over 1,000 social media accounts critical of its handling of the virus. The anticipated surge in cases and travel out of China has prompted many countries - including the UK - to impose requirements for a negative Covid-19 test on people arriving from China, drawing the ire of the Chinese government.Listen to more on what we know about China´s Covid numbers: More or Less- Behind the Stats - Can China´s data on Covid deaths be trusted-  on BBC SoundsRelated TopicsChinaHong KongCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64201776,08,01,2023

Asked whether the government would consider restrictions, Mr Wallace said: ""The government is looking at that, it´s under review, we noticed obviously what the US has done and India and I think Italy has looked at it.""""We keep under review all the time, obviously, health threats to the UK, wherever they may be.""UK Covid modelling data to stop being publishedCovid-19 in the UKSeveral countries - including the US, Japan, Italy and Malaysia - are now enforcing testing on visitors from China. This follows a surge in cases in China after Beijing´s decision to effectively end its zero-Covid policy.UK Health Minister Will Quince said he knew that many people would be concerned ""about the news coming out of China"" and the government was taking the situation ""incredibly seriously"".However, there was ""no evidence at this point of a new variant from China"", which he said would be the ""key threat"".""At the moment the variant that is in China currently is already prevalent here in the UK.""Meanwhile, the Scottish government said it currently has no plans to change travel requirements, and would continue to work with the UK Health Security Agency and other countries to ""monitor the spread of harmful variants"".In 2019, 813,532 visas were issued to people wanting to travel to the UK from China. This dropped to less than 200,000 over the following two years, owing to Beijing´s strict Covid border controls. There are concerns that a new variant may emerge in China and that international travel could quickly spread it. When there is lots of virus circulating in any population, there will be opportunities for it to change or mutate in potentially harmful ways.Covid is circulating in lots of countries around the world. According to latest estimates for the UK, one in every 45 people in Britain is infected. Vaccines are saving lives but they can´t stop infections. Instead, experts are tracking the virus and seeing if the vaccines need updating to be a better match for any significant new mutations. So far, science is keeping up with the virus and there are no particularly worrying new variants. Lord Bethell, who was health minister during the pandemic, told the BBC there was a good reason to look at testing people when they land, a policy Italy has adopted.    ""What the Italians are doing is post-flight surveillance of arrivals in Italy, in order to understand whether there are any emerging variants and to understand the impact of the virus on the Italian health system,"" he told BBC Radio 4´s Today programme.""That is a sensible thing to do and something the British government should be seriously looking at.""Chinese rush to book travel as Covid rules lifted China´s hospitals seem to be filling up - WHOChina is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he did not think the current situation in China was likely to generate many more Covid cases in the UK or generally across the globe.While China was in a ""dark"" and ""difficult"" place, the current evidence suggested the particular variant causing most infections in the country was ""very common elsewhere in the world"", he told BBC Radio 4´s PM programme on Wednesday. The UK has seen many such cases since it appeared in the summer, he added.On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.Others have also announced restrictions:In Japan, from Friday, travellers from China will be tested for Covid on arrival. Those who test positive will have to quarantine for up to seven daysIn India, people travelling from China and four other Asian countries must produce a negative Covid test before arriving.

However, the EU´s disease agency said the surge in cases in China was not expected to impact members states and said screening travellers from China for Covid would be ""unjustified"".Beijing´s foreign ministry has said coronavirus rules should only be put in place on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of ""hyping up"" the situation.China only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020.

It was a rare show of criticism of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping.Police made few arrests at the time. Now, months on, scores of those protesters are in police custody, say Chinese activists, with one group estimating there have been more than 100 arrests.International rights groups and foreign universities have called for their release. And activist groups have published lists naming the alleged detainees. This includes those who protested in Beijing as well as other cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing. Chinese authorities have not responded to queries on the detentions. But through interviews with friends and lawyers, the BBC was able to verify the names of 12 people arrested in Beijing. At least five of them have been released on bail. Among those still in custody, four women - Cao Zhixin, Li Siqi, Li Yuanjing and Zhai Dengrui - have been formally arrested for ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"". This is a notoriously vague charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years, and one which critics say is often used to stifle dissent. ´They are not activists´Many of those arrested are well-educated - some attended universities in the UK and the US - and they include writers, journalists, a musician, a teacher and a financial industry professional. Most of the Beijing detainees were part of a loose network of friends who shared a love for the arts and often met at book clubs, movie screenings and discussions.Many of them are women, and according to reports, police have questioned them about whether they were feminists or involved in ""feminist activities"". Chinese authorities have increasingly cracked down on or censored women´s rights activists in recent years.Though the group was socially conscious, and some members had shown support for #MeToo figure Xianzi, they were not activists, their friends insisted.""They are just a group of young people concerned about society… my friend is interested not just in women´s rights, but also human rights and the rights of the vulnerable. This has nothing to do with feminist-related activities,"" said one of the detainees´ friends. On 27 November, several women from the group had joined a public vigil at Liangma River in Beijing. The event was one of many spontaneously held across China that night to mourn the victims of an apartment fire in Urumqi which had shocked China - many believed the victims could not escape because of Covid restrictions, though authorities disputed this.The vigil turned into a peaceful protest, with people holding blank pieces of paper that became a symbol of their frustration.""The environment has been so oppressive for so long. They didn´t think they were participating in a movement when they went. They thought it was just a way to vent their emotions,"" another friend said.""They didn´t clash with police or express radical opinions. So they didn´t think it was serious."" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The protest in Beijing began as a vigil to mourn the victims of an apartment fire in UrumqiSo much so that their friends say they did little to protect their identities, given how swiftly China is known to silence protests. It´s unclear what led police to this particular group of friends, but they have reportedly tracked down protesters using surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, and searched the phones of those arrested.One of the detainees created a Telegram group which expanded from several members to more than 60. And many of them used phone numbers registered under their real names. Two days later, some of them were questioned by police. ""We were talking on the phone when she was being taken away,"" said the boyfriend of one detainee. ""She told me some of her friends were being taken away and lost contact. She was trying to delete stuff from her mobile phone. She was taken away before she finished deleting things.""The US rape accusation that transfixed ChinaFury and questions over China´s treatment of womenThe arrests appeared to accelerate through December and January as, one by one, more friends were detained, according to activists.Cao Zhixin, in anticipation of her arrest, sent her friends a video of herself speaking to the camera. It came with the instructions to publish it online in the event of her disappearance.""What we did was express our feelings in a reasonable way,"" Ms Cao said in the clip, which has now gone viral. ""We don´t want to disappear… if attending a mourning event is a crime, how much room is left for sharing our feelings?Concern and condemnationSeveral human rights groups and educational institutions are now calling for their release in a sign of growing international concern. British university Goldsmiths confirmed to the BBC that Li Siqi was a former student, and said it was ""deeply concerned"" for her welfare.""We condemn in the strongest terms the suppression of free speech and urge the Chinese authorities to immediately release all those who are being detained in relation to the vigil,"" a Goldsmiths spokeswoman said.She added that the university´s warden had written to the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Zheng Zeguang. The Chinese embassy is yet to respond to queries from the BBC.The University of Chicago and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) also confirmed that their former students had been arrested. A UNSW statement to the BBC called for the matter to be resolved with ""due respect for legal principles and for universal human rights"". Reporters Without Borders noted that four of the detainees including Li Siqi were journalists, and called their arrests ""one more chilling message to those who believe that factual information should be reported even when it contradicts the official narrative"".Human Rights Watch said the incident showed that ""young people in China are paying a heavy price for daring to speak out for freedom and human rights"", adding that Chinese authorities have threatened lawyers and friends who have tried to support the detainees.Killing the chickenObservers believe authorities want to send a signal with the arrests, or what rights activist Teng Biao calls ""killing the chicken to scare the monkeys"".""They want to get who they believe are the leaders and organisers, and those who play a leading role will be severely punished,"" he said, adding that the Chinese authorities´ instinct will be to find out if ""Western hostile forces"" were behind the protests.The fact that a significant number of the detainees are women, and have been reportedly questioned about supporting feminist causes, also underscores the officials´ distrust of the women´s rights movement.China in recent years has been roiled by several high-profile cases involving female victims of violence and sexual assault. These have triggered unusually harsh criticism of the authorities and have marshalled support for women´s rights. But as the movement grows, the government´s response has hardened. In 2015, it cracked down on a group of women known as the Feminist Five, and since then activists say they have been increasingly censored and attacked online. An arm of the Chinese Communist Party recently condemned ""extreme feminism"" as an ""malignant tumour"".""Maintaining ´social harmony´ has always been the government´s top priority, and feminist movements have always been considered a threat to the stability of the entire political system,"" said Altman Peng, an assistant professor at the University of Warwick who studies Chinese gender power relations.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Activists hope growing international condemnation will lead to the release of detained protestersIt is unclear what lies ahead for the protesters. Those out on bail are still liable to be charged. Those who remain in custody could be detained for several weeks as prosecutors decide whether to charge them - but that could stretch to months, if not years, in political cases, according to Mr Teng.Their families have so far remained silent, and some have cut off contact with the detainees´ friends. The BBC has learnt that one family also dropped a lawyer they had hired to fight their daughter´s case, although it is not clear why.The detainees´ families are likely to stay silent given the immense pressure they are under, says veteran rights activist Yang Zhanqing.""The police has a carrot and stick approach. Authorities would tell the families that those arrested would be released early if they kept silent. If they didn´t comply, they would lose their jobs and pension."" But increasing international scrutiny of the detentions may also aid those in custody. In such politically sensitive cases, detainees can be released early or receive better treatment in jail because of external pressure, Mr Yang says. Meanwhile, friends of the detainees, anxious and worried for their own personal safety, continue to keep tabs on the situation and share information. Many of them live overseas and did not attend the November protests, but they fear they may be targeted anyway because of their association with the detainees - and their attempts to raise international awareness of their friends´ plight. Recently, they circulated a message from one of the detainees, relayed to them from prison. She sought to reassure her friends, making it clear the detainees were keeping their spirits up.""[Our interrogators] keep making us feel that we are surrounded by friends who are traitors, or who have betrayed us,"" she said. ""But I still believe we stand together.""Some names have been withheld to protect the identity of those who fear reprisal from officials.Read more of our coverage of the recent protests in China China´s fury and fear of Covid puts Xi in a bindShocking protests are huge challenge for China´s leaders The new generation powering China´s protestsBlank paper becomes the symbol of China´s protestsRelated TopicsChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64592333,18,02,2023

From birds to balloons, and everything in between.By George BowdenBBC News, Washington DCPresident Joe Biden has said he makes no apologies for shooting down an alleged Chinese spy balloon off the coast of the US.He said the balloon was used for surveillance, but three other objects shot down over North America were unlikely to be foreign spy craft.The US would now improve its detection of similar aerial objects, he said.Mr Biden also said he would speak with China´s President Xi Jinping soon about this month´s incident.""I hope we are going to get to the bottom of this, but I make no apologies for taking down that balloon,"" Mr Biden said at the White House on Thursday.China has denied the balloon was used for surveillance, instead saying it blew off course while collecting weather data.But Mr Biden reiterated the view of US officials that the balloon, which traversed the country at an altitude of about 40,000ft (12,000m) before being blown out of the sky by a US fighter jet over the Atlantic, was in fact used for spying.He said the US was continuing to speak with China on the issue. ""We are not looking for a new cold war,"" Mr Biden said.Brief remarks leave questions unanswered Joe Biden has been under increasing pressure to talk directly to the public about the alleged Chinese surveillance balloon, as well as the three unidentified objects American fighter jets have scrambled to destroy over the past week.On Thursday afternoon he did that - but his brief appearance will do very little to silence critics or those asking for more information and explanations.He shed no light on the nature of those objects and provided no further information about the first Chinese balloon. He didn´t discuss when the Chinese balloon was first detected, its intended purpose or recent reports that it had been directed toward the US island of Guam but then changed course. Nor did he say why, after a flurry of incidents last week, no new objects have been targeted.As an explanatory endeavour, it was weak sauce. And as a public-relations effort, it will probably come up short.It may calm the waters for now, but the next time a balloon floats across the American sky, or fighters scramble and missiles fly, the questions will return with renewed urgency.Speaking about three other objects subsequently shot down over Alaska, north-west Canada and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border, Mr Biden said the intelligence community believed they were ""most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions"".The president said enhanced radar introduced in response to the Chinese balloon might explain the discovery of the three objects.""That´s why I´ve directed my team to come back to me with sharper rules for how we will deal with these unidentified objects moving forward, distinguishing between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not.""This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: ´What’s going on?´ The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 secondsMr Biden´s comments came after the White House felt the need to dispel suggestions the three objects were of extra-terrestrial origin.Officials said the slow-moving unidentified objects did not pose ""any direct threat to people on the ground"" and were destroyed ""to protect our security, our interests and flight safety"".The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which was co-ordinating searches for the objects in Canada, said on Thursday it would suspend the search of Lake Huron, in part due to the low probability of recovery.Americast: Aliens or air balloons?On whether he would take similar action again, Mr Biden said: ""Make no mistake, if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people I will take it down.""He declined to say when he planned to speak with China´s President Xi as he was asked during an interview with NBC News.""I think the last thing that Xi wants is to fundamentally rip the relationship with the United States and with me,"" Biden told the broadcaster.China has repeated its explanation for the balloon shot down on 4 February, with a spokesman telling reporters the US should try to avoid ""misunderstandings and misjudgements"".Amid the heightened tensions over US skies, military officials said on Thursday that American warplanes had intercepted Russian jets flying near Alaska for a second time this week. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad), which is jointly run by the US and Canada, said in a statement that it was a ""routine"" contact with the Russians.Related TopicsChinaUnited StatesJoe Biden",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64668143,16,02,2023

Do restrictions on travel work against Covid?South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said that travellers from China would need to have a negative PCR or antigen test before boarding flights to South Korea. They will also need to undergo a PCR test within the first day of their arrival in South Korea.Israel, meanwhile, has ordered foreign airlines not to allow people to travel from China unless they have tested negative - and asked its own citizens to avoid unnecessary travel there. Not all countries have announced controls. Germany has joined Australia, France, and Portugal in saying there will be no new rules yet.However, Germany´s health minister has said the country is seeking a co-ordinated system to monitor variants across European airports.China´s decision this week to reopen its borders on 8 January marks the last stage of the country´s controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed.As the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing maintained an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdown.In November, the frustration spilled on to the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. A week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions.Related TopicsSpainAsiaTravelChinaCoronavirus testingCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64127917,30,12,2022

They had read: ""Stand with Chinese People""; ""We Want Freedom""; and ""We Want Democracy"".Shortly after, Mr Wu tried to track down the student in a college WeChat group which had over 300 students. Warning: Contains language some readers may find offensiveHe demanded that she take the fliers down and threatened violence if she didn´t comply.According to court documents he also sent messages via Instagram and other platforms. One read: ""Post more, I will chop your bastard hands off.""He also said he had reported her actions to a ""tip-off line"" in China, and that the public security agency in the country would ""greet"" her family, prosecutors said.He is further alleged to have sought out the girl´s home address in the WeChat group, and posted her email address encouraging others to send her abuse.The US Justice Department said Mr Wu´s actions were ""an attempt to silence and intimidate the activist´s expressed views dissenting of the PRC"".""Freedom of speech is a constitutional right here in the United States and we will protect and defend it at all costs,"" said US Attorney Rachael Rollins.The FBI also alleged Mr Wu had reported his target to Chinese authorities so they would launch an investigation into her and her family.""This alleged conduct is incredibly disturbing and goes completely against our country´s democratic values,"" said FBI special agent Joseph Bonavolonta.Berklee music college meanwhile said the described behaviour was ""troubling"".The charge of stalking carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000 (£202,000), according to the US justice department.´Bridge Man´ inspires Xi protests around the world´I´m in Australia but I feel censored by Chinese students´Incidents of overseas Chinese students threatening or monitoring the activities of their compatriots at universities in the West have been reported in recent years. This has led to reports of self-censorship and even violent scuffles on campus.Rights groups and others have also raised concerns in recent years about an increased surveillance of Chinese citizens overseas who are critical of the Chinese government.The target of Mr Wu´s alleged harassment put up her posters on the campus on 22 October - just a week after the ""Bridge Man"" protests in Beijing, where an unidentified man strung banners off a bridge in the capital criticising China´s leader Xi Jinping and the country´s zero-Covid policy.He was swiftly detained by Chinese police, and reports of his protest immediately censored. However his action galvanised a wave of similar protests - particularly among young Chinese people outside of the country.While the bridge protester´s lone political protest was unusual, it presaged a wave of demonstrations against China´s zero-Covid policy just a month later. China has since ended many of its zero-Covid restrictions.Related TopicsChinaUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63967785,15,12,2022

Nandalal Weerasinghe said: ""The sooner they give us finance assurances that would be better for both [sides], as a creditor, as a debtor.""""That will help us to start repaying their obligations,"" he added.""We don´t want to be in this kind of situation, not meeting the obligations, for too long. That is not good for the country and for us. That´s not good for investor confidence in Sri Lanka.""Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?Though inflation in the country has eased slightly since last year, food prices in Sri Lanka last month were still 65% higher than a year earlier.The World Food Programme estimates that 8 million Sri Lankans - more than a third of the population - are ""food insecure"", with hunger especially concentrated in rural areas.The economic turmoil sparked mass protests last year, which resulted in the former president fleeing the country in July.Image source, Jack GarlandImage caption, The governor of Sri Lanka´s central bank P. Nandalal Weerasinghe urged China and India to act quicklyThe World Bank estimates that Sri Lanka´s economy shrank by 9.2% in 2022 and that it will contract by a further 4.2% this year.Beijing´s lending to Sri Lanka stands at around $7bn while India is owed around $1bn.The Sri Lankan government had initially hoped to agree a new payment plan with China and India by the end of 2022.Sri Lanka´s protesters have gone silent - for nowMr Weerasinghe said it was possible an agreement could come later in January but added ""this all depends on the other parties - our creditors really have to make that decision"".He added that Sri Lanka had now provided them with all the information on the country´s borrowings they needed.Independent analysts say China is concerned about what a substantial Sri Lankan debt write down could mean for its extensive lending to other developing countries through its Belt and Road programme.Meanwhile, India is said to be wary of getting inferior terms on debt restructuring to China, its regional rival.Image source, Jack GarlandImage caption, The US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung said Sri Lanka had no time to delay in resolving its debtsThe US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, said the greater onus to move was on China, as the biggest bilateral lender.""We hope that they do not delay because Sri Lanka does not have time to delay. They need these assurances immediately,"" ambassador Chung told BBC Newsnight.""For the sake of the Sri Lankan people, we certainly hope China is not a spoiler as they proceed to attain this IMF agreement.""But if India and China do ultimately agree to write down their loans to Sri Lanka another potential problem looms in the form of private creditors, who account for 40% of the country´s external debt stock.In the years after Argentina plunged into economic crisis and default in 2001, some American hedge funds, rather than accepting a restructuring of the sovereign bonds they had bought on the open market, demanded full repayment and took the country´s government to court in the US to achieve it.A large group of international economists on 8 January called for Sri Lanka´s bonds, to be ""cancelled"", writing: ""All of Sri Lanka´s creditors must ensure debt cancellation sufficient to provide a way out of the current crisis.""Asked about Sri Lanka´s private bondholders, Mr Weerasinghe said: ""We engage with private creditors in good faith negotiations. And what we are seeing is that they are very positive and they are willing to engage with us.""The governor said he expected that once agreement from bilateral creditors has been agreed the IMF funds could be distributed to Sri Lanka within ""four to six weeks"".Additional reporting by Jack Garland and Scarlett Barter.Newsnight Global is broadcast from Sri Lanka on Thursday 12 JanuaryRelated TopicsSri Lanka",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64232166,12,01,2023

American officials say this is due to a lack of transparency surrounding the virus in China, as cases surge.On Wednesday, Italy announced plans to enforce mandatory testing, after tighter measures were outlined by Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and India.Beijing said coronavirus rules should be brought in on a ""scientific"" basis. Officials in the Italian city of Milan are already testing passengers on flights from China.On one flight, which landed at the city´s Malpensa Airport on Boxing Day, 52% of passengers were found to be positive for Covid, la Repubblica reports.Officials are yet to comment on these figures but, in a statement, Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said he had ordered mandatory Covid-19 testing for all passengers coming from China and transiting through Italy.He said this was ""essential to ensure the surveillance and identification"" of any new variants of the virus, and to ""protect the Italian population"".Italy was ravaged by Covid during the first outbreak in 2020, with the northern region of Lombardy - near Malpensa Airport - at one point becoming the global epicentre of the virus after it spread from China. An EU Foreign Affairs spokeswoman said while member states had agreed to remove Covid travel restrictions earlier this year, there was an understanding that, if necessary, they could be reintroduced in a coordinated manner.She also said that the BF7 omicron variant - prevalent in China - was already present in Europe and had failed to become dominant. Passport applications for Chinese citizens wishing to travel internationally will resume from 8 January, the country´s immigration authorities have said.Travel sites have reported a spike in traffic, leaving some countries fearful over the potential spread of Covid. ""There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing Covid-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data,"" US officials said in a statement quoted by news agencies.China to begin reopening to the world in JanuaryChinese rush to book travel as Covid rules lifted Wang Wenbin, China´s foreign minister spokesperson, subsequently accused Western countries and media of ""hyping up"" and ""distorting China´s Covid policy adjustments"". He said China believed all countries´ Covid responses should be ""science-based and proportionate"", and should ""not affect normal people-to-people exchange"".Mr Wang called for ""joint efforts to ensure safe cross-border travel, maintain stability of global industrial supply chains and promote economic recovery and growth"".The UK and Germany each said they are monitoring the situation closely, but are not currently considering new restrictions for Chinese travellers. A Downing Street spokesperson said the number of cases in Britain was still ""relatively low"". Meanwhile, a German health ministry official said there was ""no indication that a more dangerous mutation [of Covid] had developed"".The true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown because officials have stopped releasing the necessary data. Reports say hospitals are overwhelmed and elderly people are dying.Last week, Beijing reported about 4,000 new Covid infections each day and few deaths.Before the relaxation of travel rules, people were strongly discouraged from travelling abroad. The sale of outbound group and package travel was banned, according to marketing solutions company Dragon Trail International.Within half an hour of Monday´s notice that China´s borders would reopen, data from travel site Trip.com - cited in Chinese media - showed searches for popular destinations had increased ten-fold on last year.Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and South Korea were the most popular destinations.Separately on Wednesday, Hong Kong´s leader John Lee announced that his city was scrapping the last of its Covid rules almost immediately - apart from the wearing of face masks, which will remain compulsory.""The city has reached a relatively high vaccination rate which builds an anti-epidemic barrier,"" Mr Lee told a media briefing.The US still requires international travellers to show proof of being fully vaccinated against Covid on entering the country. The website for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends that anyone travelling to the US gets a Covid test beforehand and has their result to hand - but this is not a legal obligation.In their statement, the unnamed US officials added they were ""following the science and advice of public health experts"" and ""consulting with partners"".China´s loosening of travel measures - the last part of the country´s controversial zero-Covid policy - follows weeks of unrest which saw people take to the streets in rare protests against President Xi Jinping and his government.

But recent posts have taken aim at experts who have defended the sudden decision to drop restrictions, despite supporting them just weeks ago. Weibo said it had spotted almost 13,000 violations, including attacks on experts, scholars and medical workers. Temporary or permanent bans have been handed to 1,120 accounts.""It is not acceptable to hurl insults at people who hold a different point of view, or publish personal attacks and views that incite conflicts,"" Weibo said in a statement.

The Ministry of Transport said it expects more than two billion passengers to travel over the next 40 days, an increase of 99.5% year-on-year and reaching 70% of trip numbers in 2019.This has led to widespread concerns that the festival may see another wave of infections, especially in rural areas that are less well-equipped with ICU beds and ventilators.From Sunday, China will drop a requirement for travellers coming from abroad to quarantine, meaning many Chinese will be able to travel abroad for the first time in almost three years.Related TopicsAsiaChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64198313,07,01,2023

It was then sent back to Taiwan from Shandong province in eastern China, Taiwanese media reported.Last year Beijing intensified military activity around the island.China sees Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to unify to it by force if necessary. Self-ruled Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the mainland.President Tsai Ing-wen has announced new plans to bolster Taiwan´s defence in the event of an attack from Beijing, including extending mandatory military service from four months to one year.In a statement, Taiwanese missile developer the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology said the device had been shipped to Switzerland by the company that had originally supplied it to the Taiwanese military. From there it was diverted for repair at the manufacturer´s Asia maintenance centre in the Chinese city of Qingdao, it said.The institute said it had removed memory cards before sending it to Europe and had also run information security checks on the device after its return and had no concerns over possible information leaks.Dr Su Tzu-yun from Taiwan´s Institute of Defence Security Research said the optical devices were not direct missile components but said Taiwan had to be more careful anyway.""Taiwan must be more strict and careful in its contract management,"" he said. ""Of course we would not want such equipment to be sent to China for repair.""The tool, a theodolite, is used to measure precise geographical location for missile launches as well as the angle and direction of the launchers, Dr Su said.""It´s like when you buy a computer, it´s a device you put on the desk to go with the machine,"" he said.Can a billionaire inspire ordinary Taiwanese to fight?Why Taiwanese are among Ukraine´s foreign fightersHe suggested that the manufacturer had not been aware the devices, purchased by a supplier in Taiwan, had subsequently been used for military purposes.It is not the first time concerns over the security of Taiwan´s missile programme have been raised. Last year, three people at two Taiwanese suppliers were sentenced to between four and 10 years in prison for using products from China to fake missile components supposedly to be made by US manufacturers.

Images of his meetings are famous, with the Russian leader at one end and the person he is speaking to so far away that you wonder if it is hard for them to hear one another.It was not like that when he met China´s top foreign policy official, Wang Yi.There they were, sitting within handshake distance, with an oval-shaped table in the middle.It could be that the proximity was achieved by seating placement at a previously used table, with the Chinese delegation directly across the middle rather than at the long ends but the effect was the same. When the footage was released, it appeared to be a deliberately symbolic move to show that he felt safe enough to be that close to the representative of such an important friend.Of course, it has not always been that way. Decades ago, Beijing´s network of underground fallout shelters was designed to protect the citizens of the Chinese capital from a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.Yet now Xi Jinping´s administration sees Russia as a front-line enemy of US influence. A nation which - like North Korea - may be considered an international pariah but which serves a useful geopolitical purpose.The Chinese government did not even seem that embarrassed when President Putin returned home from attending Beijing Winter Olympics, having proclaimed a new ""no limits"" relationship with China and, within weeks, launched the invasion of Ukraine.Many have asked whether Mr Xi was warned about the imminent war when he sat next to his Russian counterpart who must have been considering barely anything else at the time.China is walking along a very delicate path in its dealings with Russia over Ukraine. Mr Xi may feel like he is confidently striding down the track, but some think that the path is crumbling at the edges, with Beijing´s claim to neutrality increasingly difficult to stand up.Wang Yi comes out of meetings proclaiming that China and Russia are together promoting ""peace and stability"".In other parts of the world, it will seem ludicrous to use expressions like ""peace and stability"" on a trip to Russia just before the first anniversary of that country´s invasion of Ukraine.Beijing knows this and yet decided to press ahead nevertheless, in the full knowledge that it will take a hit reputationally because it has calculated that it is more important to offer significant moral support to Vladimir Putin at this time.When Wang Yi met Sergei Lavrov he said, ""I am ready to exchange views with you my dear friend, on issues of mutual interest and I look forward to reaching new agreements.""Russia´s foreign minister said the two were showing solidarity and defending each other´s interests despite ""high turbulence on the world stage"", as if this turbulence was something floating in the ether rather than chaos of his own government´s making.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Putin and Biden´s speeches compared in under a minuteEarlier this week in Beijing, China´s Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that the conflict in Ukraine could spiral out of control if certain countries kept pouring fuel on the fire.He was referring to the US, a country which is openly giving military assistance to the Ukrainian army but which has warned China not to provide Russia with weapons and ammunition.Analysts are now asking what options China might consider if it looks like President Putin is facing a humiliating battlefield defeat.Researchers in America say that Beijing is already supplying Russia with dual-use equipment, technology which can appear to be civilian but which can also, for example, be used to repair fighter jets.It has also not tried to hide the fact that it is buying up Russian oil and gas to make up for markets its neighbour lost because of sanctions which followed the invasion.What support is China giving Russia? Why so many Russians turn a blind eye to warAnd Vladimir Putin confirmed in his meeting with Wang Yi that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would soon travel to Moscow. It is thought this might happen in the coming months.In a way, the Kremlin is doing China´s dirty work. It is draining Western military resources and putting pressure on Nato and if Russia´s economy tanks because of it, does that really matter to Beijing? It will just need more Chinese products for the recovery afterwards.The problem is that Western countries have been quite united, Russia does not appear able to win and, increasingly, China is being seen standing side by side with a bully who forced a bloody, prolonged war on Europe.China has to be careful not to bite off more than it can handle, but the rest of the world also will not want Asia´s giant dragged into this war to a greater extent than it already is.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warXi JinpingChinaRussiaVladimir Putin",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64735707,22,02,2023

China’s Covid surgeBy Thomas MackintoshBBC News, LondonChina has outlined the way it counts Covid-19 deaths amid scepticism about the real impact of the disease.It says the figure includes only those who die from respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia.Officially, there were only five Covid deaths on Tuesday, two on Monday - and none in the previous two weeks.The counting method goes against World Health Organization (WHO) guidance - resulting in a figure that is way below the death toll in many other countries.The WHO says countries use different processes to test and report Covid-19 deaths making comparisons between nations difficult.It is why many countries record Covid-19 deaths as excess mortality - how many more people died than would normally be expected based on death figures before the pandemic hit.These calculations also take into account deaths which were not directly because of Covid but were caused by its knock-on effects - including people being unable to access hospitals for the care they require.By contrast, China has strict criteria for confirming Covid-19 cases, which include evidence in patients of lung damage caused by the virus. This must be confirmed in a scan.But, the country is currently experiencing a surge in cases since the lifting of its most severe restrictions earlier this month. What is China´s policy and how many cases are there?Official figures show a relatively low number of new daily cases and deaths. This has led to fears the numbers are an underestimate due to a recent reduction in Covid testing.In a bid to address the concerns the State Council held a news conference on Tuesday.Infectious disease expert Prof Wang Gui-qiang clarified that only pneumonia and respiratory failure caused by the coronavirus were counted as Covid deaths. Deaths caused by underlying diseases are not included in the official count, state-owned China News Service reported.Strict lockdowns are said to account for China´s official death toll staying so low since the start of the pandemic - the official figure is just over 5,200.This is equal to only three Covid deaths in every million in China, compared with 3,000 per million in the US and 2,400 per million in the UK.China has faced challenges with vaccines being used and particularly getting them to the most vulnerable people.Overall, China says more than 90% of its population has been fully vaccinated. However, less than half of people aged 80 and over have received three doses of vaccine. Elderly people are more likely to suffer severe Covid symptoms.China has developed and produced its own vaccines, which have been shown to be less effective at protecting people against serious Covid illness and death than the mRNA vaccines used in much of the rest of the world.Prof Wang´s comments come as hospitals in the capital Beijing and in other cities struggle to cope with the latest Covid surge.The latest wave has also hit postal and catering services hard.Meanwhile, China´s largest city, Shanghai, has ordered most of its schools to take classes online as cases soar.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64044204,20,12,2022

After almost three years of closed borders, this will reopen the country to those with work and study visas, or seeking to visit family.Travel overseas for Chinese citizens will become easier, the immigration authority said on Tuesday.Covid has spread ferociously in the wake of restrictions being lifted.Reports say hospitals are overwhelmed and elderly people are dying.The true toll - daily case counts and deaths - is currently unknown because officials have stopped releasing Covid data. Beijing had reported about 4,000 new Covid infections each day last week and few deaths.On Sunday it said it would stop publishing case numbers altogether. But British health data firm Airfinity estimated China was experiencing more than a million infections and 5,000 deaths a day.China is the last major economy in the world to move to ""living with Covid"" after three years of lockdowns, closed borders and mandatory quarantine for Covid cases and contacts. The so-called zero-Covid approach battered the economy and made citizens weary of restrictions and repeated tests. Resentment against the policy exploded into rare public protests against President Xi Jinping in November, which was followed by authorities dropping Covid rules just a few weeks later.Closed borders remain the last major restriction. Since March 2020, anyone entering China had to undergo mandatory quarantine at a state facility - for up to three weeks at a time. That was recently reduced to five days. But on Monday the National Health Commission announced that Covid would be formally downgraded to a Class B infectious disease on 8 January. That meant quarantine would be axed - although incoming travellers will still need to take a PCR test. A cap on the daily number of flights allowed into China would also be scrapped.´Everyone I know is getting a fever´ - Covid hits China Tracking China´s Covid waveAuthorities said they would also ""optimise"" visa arrangements for foreigners wishing to come to China for work and study, as well as family visits and reunions. It´s unclear if that includes tourist visas, but officials said a pilot programme would begin for international cruise ships.Chinese citizens wishing to apply for passports to travel abroad will also be able to do so from 8 January, the immigration authority announced on Tuesday.Prior to the pandemic, the number of outbound tourists from China stood at 155 million in 2019, according to Statista. This number dropped to 20 million in 2020.The new rules have been welcomed by many Chinese who will now be able to travel overseas again. The country´s top online travel agencies reported a spike in traffic within hours of the announcement. Many people will be hoping to visit family and loved ones during Chinese New Year, which begins on 22 January.But many have also expressed anger over the sudden freedom after years of controls.""I´m happy about it but also speechless. If we´re doing this [reopening] anyway - why did I have to suffer all the daily Covid tests and lockdowns this year?"" said Rachel Liu, who lives in Shanghai.She said she had endured three months of lockdown in April, but nearly everyone in her family had become infected with the virus in recent weeks.She said her parents, grandparents and partner - living across three different cities in Xi´an, Shanghai and Hangzhou - had all come down with fever last week.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Hospitals - like this one in Shanghai - are under strain in this Covid waveMany have also expressed concern online about borders reopening as Covid cases peak in China.""Why can´t we wait until this wave passes to open up? The medical workers are already worn out, and old people won´t survive two infections in one month,"" read one top-liked comment on Weibo.People in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, which experience chilly temperatures in the winter, say they´re running out of flu and cold medicine. It´s feared that hundreds of deaths may be going unreported as crematoriums are overwhelmed. In the capital, Beijing, authorities say they are planning to distribute the Pfizer tablets, Paxlovid, in order to try and reduce the severity of infections and ease the pressure on hospitals. But health centres contacted by The Global Times on Monday said the drug had yet to be delivered.On Monday, President Xi issued his first remarks on the changes, calling on officials to do what was ""feasible"" to save lives. State media quoted him saying the country faced a new situation with pandemic control, and needed a more targeted response.China´s about-turn on how it manages the pandemic has put Mr Xi in a tough spot. He was the driving force behind zero-Covid, which many blamed for restricting people´s lives excessively and crippling the economy. But having abandoned it, analysts say he now has to take responsibility for the huge wave of infections and hospital admissions. Many have questioned why the country was not better prepared.Are you hoping to visit China in the new year to see family?

LVMH said they experienced a second straight record year with revenue and profits despite geopolitical tensions and high cost of living.Sales reached almost $25bn (£19.9), a 9% increase in the final three months of the year. The company saw strong growth in Europe, US and Japan which made up for losses in China due to Covid lockdowns. In Asia, LVMH did experience a 20% drop in growth in the first nine months as the world´s second largest economy doubled down on its zero-Covid policy.  However, LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said he felt cautiously optimistic about ""green shoots"" in China.  ""We have every reason to be confident, indeed optimistic about China,"" Mr Arnault said at the group´s earnings presentation.  He pointed to their Macau stores as a sign of what could come. ""Business is back, the Chinese are buying,"" he said. LVMH brands include Tiffany´s, Christian Dior, Sephora, Hennessey and Moët. Its designer label Louis Vuitton did exceptionally well. Its revenue surpassed $21.7bn for the first time. The label recently launched a new collaboration with Japanese contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama, who is known for her art made of colourful dots. LVMH´s earnings are viewed by analysts as a bellwether in the luxury market.Bain and Company said they see a boost in spending on personal luxury goods overall. ""The personal luxury market is projected to see further growth of at least 3-8% next year, even given a downturn in global economic conditions,"" according to a report from the consulting company.Earlier this month, LVMH made changes to its leadership staff. Mr Arnault, one of the world´s richest men, appointed his daughter as the head of the fashion house Dior.

This had halted some search efforts overnight, which were also hampered by a second landslide later in the day. ""The rescue work is being carried out in an orderly and tense manner,"" he told state broadcaster CCTV.Police told CCTV that an investigation was underway, and that the relevant persons have been ""controlled"".The mine collapsed around 13:00 local time (0500 GMT) on Wednesday, burying more than 50 workers. It affected a ""wide area"", authorities said.The collapse left a pile of debris roughly 500m (1,640ft) across and an estimated 80m high.CCTV reported the shaft had been operated by the Xinjing Coal Mining Company, which has not issued a statement yet.Mines in China´s Inner Mongolia region are some of China´s top coal producers. Chinese mines have also been trying to boost output over the past year in a bid to boost supplies and lower prices. Accidents are not uncommon in China, where industrial safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December 2020, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. And in January 2021, 10 miners were killed in a blast at a gold mine in Shandong province.Related TopicsChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64730607,23,02,2023

Asymptomatic cases and positive results from home testing kits are not recorded in the data. Image source, ReutersImage caption, People gathered outside a crematorium in BeijingHow reliable is the data?The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked for more ""rapid, regular and reliable"" data on numbers of hospitalisation and deaths.Beijing says it has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law.""Dr Louise Blair, of the UK-based research company Airfinity, says that although the new death toll is higher than earlier, it may still not represent the true number of deaths when you compare China´s figures with those from other countries.""We would expect China to have higher mortality per capita than those countries as they had higher protection from vaccines and in many cases natural immunity than China.""""These numbers imply a much lower number of deaths per capita in China than all other major countries have experienced,"" she adds.Health services under pressureA study by Peking University estimated that as of 11 January, some 64% of the population were reported to be infected with the virus.Reports in late December suggested hospitals were under growing strain from the number of cases, with long queues for clinics and patients on hospital beds in the middle of busy waiting rooms.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Images appear to show overrun hospitals, like this one in the city of Tianjin on 28 DecemberVideos emerged on social media throughout December appearing to show crowded hospitals as well as queues at funeral homes.The BBC´s team in Beijing has also reported on long queues outside health clinics and a high demand for fever remedies at pharmacies.Covid wave batters China´s overstretched hospitalsTemporary health centres have been set up along with intensive care facilities across the country.How has China´s Covid policy changed? There was a sudden lifting of many of China´s Covid restrictions following protests against strict lockdowns across the country in November.Before that, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as its zero-Covid policy. The measures included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of Covid cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.Image source, China News ServiceImage caption, Schools had been closed in ShanghaiLockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished.A negative Covid test is no longer required to enter public transport, restaurants, gyms and other public buildings (with the exception of orphanages and care homes).On 8 January, China fully opened its borders with no travel restrictions or quarantine measures for arrivals.However, several countries including the US and the UK, have imposed Covid testing on visitors from China due to its Covid surge in a move strongly criticised by China.China´s vaccination policyOverall, China says more than 90% of the population has been fully vaccinated. However, around the time its zero-Covid policy was lifted,  less than half of people aged 80 and over had received three doses of vaccine.   The authorities now say they require local health services to ""strengthen immunization of the whole population, particularly the elderly"".There are doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - are effective against Omicron, the most widespread strain.China has refused to use Western vaccines widely.The government has given no official explanation. However, national pride may be a factor according to Dr Yu Jie, Senior Research Fellow on China at the international affairs think tank Chatham House:""I think it´s Xi Jinping really thinking of things in terms of economic self-reliance - that need to have China produce and use its own vaccine, rather than import it from somewhere.""Reporting by Wanyuan Song, Jake Horton and Jeremy Howell.Related TopicsChinaReality CheckCoronavirus pandemicTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

The report estimates that 64% of the country´s population has the virus. It ranks Gansu province, where 91% of the people are reported to be infected, at the top, followed by Yunnan (84%) and Qinghai (80%).A top Chinese epidemiologist has also warned that cases will surge in rural China over the lunar new year.The peak of China´s Covid wave is expected to last two to three months, added Zeng Guang, ex-head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control.Hundreds of millions of Chinese are travelling to their hometowns - many for the first time since the pandemic began - ahead of the lunar new year on 23 January.China has stopped providing daily Covid statistics since abandoning zero-Covid. But hospitals in big cities - where healthcare facilities are better and more easily accessible - have become crowded with Covid patients as the virus has spread through the country.Speaking at an event earlier this month, Mr Zeng said it was ""time to focus on the rural areas"", in remarks reported in the Caixin news outlet.Many elderly, sick and disabled in the countryside were already being left behind in terms of Covid treatment, he added.China´s central Henan province is the only province to have given details of infection rates - earlier this month a health official there said nearly 90% of the population had had Covid, with similar rates seen in urban and rural areas.However government officials say many provinces and cities have passed the peak of infections.The Lunar New Year holidays in China, which officially start from 21 January, involves the world´s largest annual migration of people.Some two billion trips are expected to be made in total and tens of millions of people have already travelled.Chinese hope lunar new year consigns Covid to pastYoung Chinese self-infect amid Covid fears for elderlyLast month, China abruptly abandoned its zero Covid policies. It also reopened its borders on Sunday.Official data shows five or fewer deaths a day over the past month, numbers which are inconsistent with the long queues seen at funeral homes and reports of deaths on social media.In December Chinese officials said they planned to issue monthly rather than daily updates on the Covid situation in the country.The World Health Organisation (WHO) said China, which stopped reporting Covid fatalities from Tuesday, was heavily under-reporting Covid deaths. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin stressed again at a regular press briefing on Thursday that Beijing has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law"", having held technical exchanges with the WHO over the past month.International health experts have predicted at least a million Covid-related deaths in China this year. Beijing has officially reported just over 5,000 deaths since the pandemic began, one of the lowest death rates in the world.Related TopicsChinaCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64258799,13,01,2023

Yen is a globally recognised action star who recently drew controversy for an interview in which he called the protests a riot. The 59-year-old is best known for the Ip Man movies, a Hong Kong series based on a martial arts master which has grossed more than US$400m (£338m) at the worldwide box office. He will next appear alongside Keanu Reeves in Hollywood film John Wick 4.The petition - set up by well-known Hong Kong activist Tong Wai-hung - claims that the Academy´s invitation to Yen shows ""contempt for the people of Hong Kong"" and his presence will ""damage the image and reputation of the film industry"". It has more than 84,000 signatures.Last Thursday, Yen was named as a presenter for the 95th Academy Awards, which will take place at in Los Angeles on Sunday. It is not known which category Yen is scheduled to present in. The BBC has contacted the Academy for comment. Born in Guangzhou, China, Yen was raised in Hong Kong and moved to the US at the age of 11. He gained American citizenship, but later renounced it.In a recent interview with GQ Hype, the father of three reiterated his opposition to the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The protests were initially sparked by plans to allow extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, before growing into a wider anti-government movement. ""It wasn´t a protest, okay, it was a riot. I´m not going to be here talking about how to change how people feel about it,"" Yen said.""But my own experience, like, I was there, I have many friends who were there. I don´t want to get political. A lot of people might not be happy for what I´m saying, but I´m speaking from my own experience."" Yen also asserted that Western media outlets such as the BBC and CNN only focus on ""negative stories"" about China.Earlier this month, he participated in the Two Sessions in Beijing, the annual meetings of China´s legislature and top political advisory body, as a Hong Kong delegate. They are attended by thousands of representatives from across the country.Yen is a member of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which has no real legislative power and draws its members from various sectors of society.

The ECDC added: ""We remain vigilant and will be ready to use the emergency brake if necessary.""The EU can issue recommendations, but each nation is free to make their own policies, like Italy.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her country´s efforts to curb Covid-19 transmissions from China would be undermined if other EU countries did not follow suit. In the UK, a minister said the issue was ""under review"".Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said testing visitors from China, Hong Kong and Macau was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"". China´s National Health Commission published its most recent daily Covid data on 24 December, registering 4,128 new cases the day before. But analysts say such numbers are a vast underestimate - and the daily case load may be closer to a million. On Thursday, British health data firm Airfinity said 9,000 people in China could be dying from Covid-19 each day - almost double its previous daily estimate.Despite the official numbers being low, the World Health Organization has warned the healthcare system in China could be under severe pressure.As Covid surges in China, some nearby countries have moved swiftly to announce restrictions.In India, people travelling from China and four other Asian countries must produce a negative Covid test before arriving, with those who test positive put in quarantineIn Japan, from Friday, travellers from China will be tested for Covid upon arrival.

China is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily case load may be closer to a million. Hospitals are overwhelmed and residents are struggling to find basic medicines, according to reports. On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.How many Covid cases are there in China?´Everyone I know is getting a fever´ - Covid hits China The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"".But Beijing´s foreign ministry on Wednesday had said coronavirus rules should only be instated on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of  ""hyping up"" the situation.Some people reacted angrily on China´s censored social media. ""I thought all of the foreign countries had opened up. Isn´t this racism?"" read one comment that was liked 3,000 times on Weibo. The US has said testing is required of anyone coming from China, or via a third country, regardless of nationality.But others said they understood the reason for the conditions: ""This is nothing compared to all the restrictions we had for people coming into China,"" one user wrote. Beijing only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020. Until this week, anyone entering China had to undergo quarantine in state facilities. Before the pandemic, China had been the world´s largest outbound tourism market. But it´s unclear how many Chinese people will travel abroad after 8 January given that the number of flights are limited, and many citizens need to renew their passports. The international community´s reaction has varied with the UK and Australia saying they were monitoring China´s Covid situation but were not planning on announcing new testing requirements.  Others have moved swiftly to announce restrictions:In Japan, from Friday, travellers from China will be tested for Covid upon arrival. Those who test positive will have to quarantine for up to seven days. The number of flights to and from China will also be restrictedIn India, people travelling from China and four other Asian countries must produce a negative Covid test before arriving.

Those who test positive will be able to isolate at homeMeanwhile Malaysia has put additional tracking and surveillance measures in placeItaly has also imposed mandatory Covid testing on travellers from ChinaThe European Commission said its health security committee would convene on Thursday to discuss ""possible measures for a coordinated EU approach"" to China´s Covid surge. But Italy, an EU member state and an epicentre of the virus in late 2019 and 2020, said it was moving first to ""ensure the surveillance and identification"" of any new variants of the virus.Flights arriving in Milan this week were already testing passengers from China. Authorities found 52% of passengers were infected with Covid on one flight that landed on 26 December.Initial tests of Covid-positive travellers arriving from China showed that 15 of them had Omicron variants that were already present in Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said. She described the news as quite reassuring.Italy is one of 26 European countries in the border-free Schengen zone and Ms Meloni is calling for EU-wide testing of Chinese passengers, arguing that Italy´s own measures might otherwise be ineffective. China´s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that ""currently the development of China´s epidemic situation is overall predictable and under control"". However, the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. On Sunday, officials said they would also stop releasing daily case counts.""The infection surge in China is on expected lines,"" Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an Indian epidemiologist and health systems specialist told the BBC in a recent interview. ""If you have a susceptible population that is not exposed to the virus, cases will rise. Nothing has changed for the rest of the world.""China´s decision to reopen its borders marks the end of the country´s controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed. Even as the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing insisted on an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdowns.The economy took a hit and people grew both exhausted and angry - in November, the frustration spilled onto the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. Week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions.Related TopicsTourismAsiaTravelChinaCoronavirus testingCoronavirus pandemic",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64111492,29,12,2022

Streets and malls are busy again after officials announced the end of the current wave, sparked by the sudden reversal of three-year-long restrictions.There is no public record of how much China invested in what became a signature policy of leader Xi Jinping. But according to a Reuters estimate last year, Beijing was on track to spend more than 350 billion yuan ($52bn; £43bn) on Covid testing, new medical facilities, monitoring equipment and other anti-Covid measures in 2022. And now much of that infrastructure is being dismantled or repurposed - or at least that´s what officials are trying to do. In Shandong province, they recently turned a makeshift hospital - which appears to be built from metal containers - into a rental space. It offers discounted apartments to ""skilled talents"", although it´s unclear who qualifies for this. This is despite local media reporting in only December - just before zero-Covid was dropped - that Shandong´s local government was planning to spend 23bn yuan on building makeshift hospitals. This particular 605-room facility, located in the provincial capital Jinan, was being used as a quarantine centre. One tenant, who works at a carmaker nearby, told Jinan Daily that he ""literally moved in with his suitcase"", adding it was ""very convenient"" as his workplace was just across the street.The government has portrayed this as a cost-saving win. Many people commenting online support it too, suggesting it as a housing option for migrant workers.Others, however, question how comfortable this ""square cabin"" would be in winter, especially as it was built within a month last year.""I suggest the person who came up with the idea go and live in the square cabin,"" one user on Weibo mocked. On Douyin - the Chinese version of TikTok - a top-liked comment read: ""This will surely scare the talents away.""But that´s not all that remains as an inescapable reminder of life under zero-Covid. Testing booths, both mobile and stationary, had been a common sight across the country. Located in every neighbourhood, they played an essential role in implementing zero-Covid. Now some of these booths are up for sale - from 500-8,000 yuan - on second-hand trading platforms. Many more are still on the streets, sitting empty and no longer in use. Image caption, An abandoned testing booth in BeijingQueues at these sites were common at the peak of restrictions as some places required people to test every day. Often people had to have a negative result for permission to use the bus or buy groceries. Tape and barricades also frequently seen - to section off parts of streets for testing booths, queues or other Covid-related measures. Many of these remain visible too.Image caption, Tape like this was used to cordon off areasImage caption, Temporary barricades lie on the side of the roadWhile most testing requirements are gone, bright red posters asking people to scan QR codes can still be spotted everywhere.Under zero-Covid, anyone entering shops or restaurants was required to scan these codes, which revealed their travel history, whether or not they had Covid, or whether they had been in contact with someone who had tested positive. Image caption, A notice from February 2020 asking people to register travel information via a QR codeIn some cases the signs are stuck on to restaurants and shopfronts that have long shut. Zero-Covid hit China´s economy hard, strangling supply chains and shuttering businesses, from economic hub Shanghai to rural towns.

There has never been an official tally of their number, and it seems like authorities have given little guidance on where they could work next.

China has been widely accused of underreporting coronavirus deaths, despite evidence of hospitals and crematoriums being overrun. According to officials, China recorded 59,938 Covid-related deaths between 8 December and 12 January. Most of those who died were over 80, with most having underlying conditions.The figures, include 5,503 deaths caused by respiratory failure directly due to the virus, and 54,435 caused by underlying conditions combined with the virus. The real total is likely to be higher because which the figures refer only to deaths recorded at medical facilities.Image source, Tingshu Wang/ReutersLast month, Beijing changed the way it categorises Covid deaths, only counting towards its total those who died of respiratory failure directly induced by the virus.The World Health Organisation criticised the definition, describing it as ""too narrow"".Beijing has always contended that its figures are accurate, calling on the WHO to ""uphold a scientific, objective and just position"". Officials said that the peak of patients hospitalised with severe Covid was in early January, although the number subsequently remained high. They said that they would continue to monitor the situation in rural areas, focusing on early detection and prioritising treatment of the most vulnerable.

The order follows similar moves by the EU and Canada in recent weeks. A spokesperson for China´s foreign ministry accused the US of abusing state power to suppress foreign firms.""We firmly oppose those wrong actions,"" spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday. ""The US government should respect the principles of market economy and fair competition, stop suppressing the companies and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies in the US.""""How unsure of itself can the world´s top superpower like the US be to fear young people´s favourite app like that?"" she added. Western officials have become increasingly concerned about the popular video sharing app - which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance - in recent months. However, Australia said it had not received any advice from its intelligence services recommending that it follow the examples of the US, the EU and Canada. TikTok has faced allegations that it harvests users´ data and hands it to the Chinese government, with some intelligence agencies worried that sensitive information could be exposed when the app is downloaded to government devices.The company insists it operates no differently to other social media companies and says it would never comply with an order to transfer data. On Monday, US Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young told agencies they had to scrub the app from all state-issued phones to protect confidential data. The agency said the guidance marked a ""critical step forward in addressing the risks presented by the app to sensitive government data"". Some federal offices - including the White House and the Departments of Defence, Homeland Security and State - have already banned TikTok from their devices. The US Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said the move emphasised the Biden administration´s ""ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people´s security and privacy"". Tuesday´s announcement follows the passage of legislation by the US House of Representatives in December which banned the use of TikTok on state-issued phones and gave the White House 60 days to issue agency directives. And congressional Republicans are expected to pass further legislation in the coming weeks which would give President Joe Biden the power to ban the app nationally. ""We hope that when it comes to addressing national security concerns about TikTok beyond government devices, Congress will explore solutions that won´t have the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans,"" a TikTok spokesperson told the BBC. TikTok answers three cybersecurity fears about appTikTok under investigation by Canadian privacy authoritiesIndia bans TikTok and dozens more Chinese appsCanada has also imposed a new ban on the app on government devices starting from Tuesday. The decision followed a review conducted by the country´s chief information officer, who ruled the app presented ""an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security"".Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change.""This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,"" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto.And the European Parliament also approved a ban on the app on staff phones, following the European Commission´s move last week. A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that the bans had been adopted ""without any deliberation"" and amounted to ""little more than political theatre"".

Outlets operate under tight Communist Party control. The opening-up of the industry has extended to distribution and advertising, not to editorial content. However, there is leeway for independent coverage that is not perceived as a threat to social stability or the Party.Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has described President Xi Jinping as the ""planet´s leading censor and press freedom predator"". It says government policies are aimed at achieving ""complete hegemony over news coverage and the creation of an international media order heavily influenced by China"".  Beijing tries to limit access to foreign news by restricting rebroadcasting and the use of satellite receivers, by jamming shortwave broadcasts, including those of the BBC, and by blocking websites. Overseas Chinese-language news outlets that are not state-owned are blocked in mainland China. However, international English language websites like the BBC are often available to view. But content that is contrary to Communist Party rhetoric is filtered and English-language news sites can be filtered at times of tension. Fears that the media in Hong Kong would lose their independence when the territory reverted to Chinese control in 1997 have generally not been borne out. Hong Kong still has editorially-dynamic media, but worries about interference remain.TV is available in most homes and the sector is competitive, especially in cities. There are more than 3,300 local, regional and national TV channels.State-run Chinese Central TV (CCTV) is China´s largest media company. Its dominance is challenged by provincial TVs, which are on the air nationally via satellite. China is a major market for pay TV, which is almost entirely delivered by cable. All of China´s 2,600-plus radio stations are state-owned.There are around 1,900 newspapers. Each city has its own title, usually published by the local government, as well as a local Communist Party daily. China spends hugely on TV, radio, online and press outlets targeted at international audiences, aiming to extend its political influence and boost its image. It is less keen to allow foreign players into the domestic market. Phenomenal online growthChina has the world´s largest internet-using population. There were 1.01 billion internet users by July 2022, comprising 69% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com).Around 26.7 per cent of the online population live in rural areas. The China Internet Network Information Centre (CNNIC) says 98.6% of China´s online population can access the internet via a smartphone. There are three powerful online giants, known collectively as ""BAT"": Baidu is the top search engine; e-commerce leader Alibaba has allied with Sina, which operates the Weibo microblog platform; and Tencent owns instant messenger WeChat.Because of official censorship, Weibo is losing some of its appeal as a forum where relatively uncensored news can be shared. WeChat, Tencent´s take on the WhatsApp instant messenger, has the largest number of domestic users of any social media service in China.China has the world´s largest online video market. Streaming platforms, including market leader iQiyi, Youku Tudou and Sohu have a huge following and pose a challenge to traditional TV.An extensive web filtering system, dubbed the ""Great Firewall of China"", blocks tens of thousands of sites using URL filtering and keyword censoring.Thousands of cyber-police watch the web and material deemed politically and socially sensitive is filtered. Blocked resources include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and human rights sites.The use of circumvention tools, including virtual private networks (VPNs), became harder after China strengthened its firewall to allow it to intercept data traffic to and from individual IP addresses. This was coined the ""Great Fire Cannon"" when it came into effect in 2015. The government since has signalled that it will ban unapproved VPNs.Media guides by BBC MonitoringPressPeople´s Daily (Renmin Ribao) - Communist Party daily, web pages in EnglishChina Youth Daily (Zhongguo Qingnian Bao) - state-run, linked to Communist Youth LeagueChina Daily - official English-language paperGlobal Times (Huanqiu Shibao) - state-run, editions in English and Chinese, focuses on world affairsPeople´s Liberation Army Daily (Jiefangjun Bao) - web pages in EnglishReference News (Cankao Xiaoxi) - published by official news agency Xinhua21st Century (21 Jingji) - leading business newspaper, privately-ownedTelevisionChinese Central TV (CCTV) - state-run national broadcaster; 18 free-to-air networksChina Global TV Network (CGTN) - state-run international broadcaster; networks in English, Arabic, French, Russian, SpanishRadioChina National Radio - state-runChina Radio International - state-run external broadcaster, programmes in more than 40 languages, notably to Taiwan and KoreaNews agencyXinhua (New China News Agency) - state-run, web pages in EnglishChina News Service (CNS) - state-run, web pages in English Related TopicsMediaAsiaChinaAsia PacificTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published17 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published12 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished2 hours agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

It has a continuous culture stretching back nearly 4,000 years and originated many of the foundations of the modern world.   The People´s Republic of China was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang, who retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the People´s Republic on the mainland and the Republic of China on Taiwan.After stagnating for decades under the rigid totalitarian socialism of founder Mao Zedong, China reformed its economy along partly-capitalist lines to make it one of the world´s fastest-growing, as well a leading exporter. China is now a major overseas investor, and is pursuing an increasingly assertive foreign and defence policy far beyond East Asia.But economic change has not been matched by political reform, and the Communist Party retains a tight grip on political life and much of wider society.See more country profiles - Profiles compiled by BBC MonitoringPEOPLE´S REPUBLIC OF CHINA: FACTSCapital: BeijingArea: 9,596,961 sq kmPopulation: 1.41 billionLanguages:  Mandarin Chinese, also Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Zhuang and othersLife expectancy: 74 years (men) 79 years (women)LEADERSPresident: Xi JinpingImage source, Getty ImagesXi Jinping came to power in 2012-3 as the hand-picked heir of predecessor Hu Jintao, and is expected to lead China into the next decade.Since taking over he has concentrated power in his hands, rather than sticking with the traditional post-Mao system of collective leadership.His position as the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong was cemented in 2017, when his name and political philosophy was written into the Communist Party constitution.In early 2018 the party allowed him to remain in office indefinitely by abolishing the conventional two-term presidential limit. President Xi rejects constitutional democracy and human rights as models for China, has imposed strict limits on freedom of expression, especially on social media, and tightened control over Hong Kong.He has also subjected the whole country to strict lockdowns as part of a controversial Zero Covid policy, while incarcerating thousands of Muslim Uighurs in brutal ""re-education camps"".MEDIAImage source, AFPImage caption, China has the world´s biggest internet audience, but content is tightly controlledChina is the largest media market in the world.Outlets operate under tight Communist Party control.

Beijing denies US claims it was used for spying.The world´s two biggest economies have also been in a trade war since 2018.The new figures show that US imports from China increased to $536.8bn last year as American shoppers spent more on Chinese-made goods, including toys and mobile phones. In the same period, US exports to China increased to $153.8bn.While some of the increase in trade between the two countries is a result of the rising cost of living, the figures also point to how reliant the US and China still are on each other even after years of trade conflict between them.""I think it´s an important indication of the difficulties of actually decoupling,"" Deborah Elms, the founder of Asian Trade Centre, told the BBC.   ""Even if governments, firms and consumers wanted to separate, the economics make it difficult to deliver products in a decoupled world at a price that firms and consumers are willing to pay,"" she added.High-altitude spying marks new low for US-China tiesBiden moves to halt US exports to Huawei - reportsIn 2018, the Trump administration started to ramp up trade measures against Beijing.After decades of rising Chinese imports, Mr Trump began imposing tariffs on a total of more than $300bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by placing import levies on about $100bn of American goods.Most of those measures remain in place more than two years after Joe Biden became president.This month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been due to visit China in what was seen as a thawing of relations between the two country´s.America´s top diplomat was set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.However, the trip was abruptly postponed after the discovery of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that drifted across America. Chinese officials have repeatedly said that the ""airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident"".In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden made no direct mention of the Chinese balloon but said that his administration will always protect its sovereignty.""I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world. But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China´s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did,"" he said.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Video appears to show China balloon shot downRelated TopicsChinaUnited StatesChina-US relationsTrade",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64563855,08,02,2023
