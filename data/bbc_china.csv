It will not stop the rejuvenation of China,"" said Qin Gang. Mr Qin, China´s former ambassador to the US, held his first press conference as foreign minister on Tuesday.The spy balloon saga has heightened tensions between the superpowers despite recent efforts to improve ties. ""It [the US] regards China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong,"" said Mr Qin, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China´s parliament in Beijing. The foreign minister was responding to a question on whether a healthy China-US relationship was still possible as differences between the countries grew.The US called for establishing ""guardrails"", but what it really wants is for China to not hit back with words or actions when provoked, Mr Qin added. He was referring to US President Joe Biden´s comments last month that the US would ""compete fully with China but [is] not looking for conflict"". Biden makes no apologies for downing balloonMr Qin said: ""If the US does not put on the brakes and continues to roar down the wrong road, no amount of guardrails can stop the derailment and overturning, and it is bound to fall into conflict and confrontation. Who will bear its disastrous consequences?"" He also said the diplomatic crisis caused by the balloon incident could have been averted but the US acted with ""the presumption of guilt"". Washington has previously described the suspected spy balloon as a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"". Beijing admitted the object belonged to them, but said it was a civilian airship blown off-course. Spy Balloons: Are They Really A Threat?The BBC´s Gordon Corera breaks down what we know about spy balloonsWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)Relations between the two countries deteriorated during former US President Donald Trump´s administration, which launched a trade war against China in 2018. The two superpowers continue to clash on various issues, including Taiwan, China´s militarisation of the South China Sea and the origins of Covid.Mr Qin´s comments follow Chinese President Xi Jinping´s unusually direct rebuke of the US on Monday.Mr Xi said ""Western countries led by the US had implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression"" against China and that this brought ""severe challenges"" to the country.On Tuesday, Mr Qin said an ""invisible hand"" was driving the Ukraine crisis but did not name any country or individual. He reiterated that China had not provided weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine war and called for peace talks to resume.However, he asked: ""Why should the US demand that China refrain from supplying arms to Russia when it sells arms to Taiwan?""The Ukraine crisis has reached a ""critical juncture"", he said.""Either a ceasefire will stop the war, restore peace and embark on a political settlement, or fuel the fire, expand the crisis and drag it into the abyss of losing control.""Mr Qin, 56, was named China´s foreign minister in December 2022 and is one of the youngest appointees to this post in the country´s history. He replaced Wang Yi, who was promoted to the politburo of the ruling Communist Party in October that year.A trusted aide of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr Qin is well known as a tough-talking diplomat.

Last December, they clashed in what some experts saw as a worrying sign of how things could escalate.Tawang, a pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhists perched some 3,000m (10,000ft) above sea level, is home to India´s largest Buddhist monastery. For this reason and because of its strategic location, it´s long been the focus of tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.The town is claimed by China. Tibet, annexed by China in 1950, lies just 35km (22 miles) to the north. ""It´s not just the Tawang sector,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People´s Liberation Army, told the BBC. ""The entire Arunachal Pradesh [state], which we call southern Tibet, has been illegally occupied by India - it´s non-negotiable.""Image caption, December´s clash is reported to have taken place not far from Chumi Gyatse waterfall near the borderTawang hit the headlines in December after the first clashes there in years. India said Chinese soldiers encroached into its territory and ""unilaterally tried to change the status quo"". China said its troops were on routine patrol on their side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which separates Chinese and Indian held territory, and had been ""blocked by the Indian army illegally crossing the line"".  The fight that ensued reportedly left several soldiers injured on both sides. It followed a far more serious clash in 2020 at the other end of the disputed frontier. In a mass brawl in Ladakh´s Galwan valley, 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed - it was the first fatal confrontation over the border in 45 years and highlighted the risks faced as the rivals try to further their strategic goals. Image caption, With special permits, India allows domestic tourists all the way up to Bum La Pass, on the border with ChinaSince then, tensions have escalated, with both sides deploying tens of thousands of troops with heavy armaments along the disputed border. Claims are being reinforced in other ways too. In mid-February India announced plans to invest in more than 660 ""vibrant villages"" to encourage locals near the border to stay. The move was seen as a response to reports of model villages on China´s side.India is also promoting tourism in Arunachal Pradesh with hotels, restaurants and home-stays springing up in Tawang and surrounding areas. India and China share a frontier that isn´t fully demarcated, and have overlapping territorial claims. India says it is 3,488km long; China puts it at around 2,000km.Of all the disputed areas, Tawang remains high up on China´s list of claims.It was among areas taken during a brief war in 1962 that ended in a humiliating defeat for India. Thousands of PLA troops overran Indian positions before withdrawing.""Tawang is indispensable to China. The Tibetan spiritual leader the sixth Dalai Lama was born there [in the 17th Century],"" said Mr Zhou, who attended India-China border talks as a military expert in the mid-1990s. ""What better evidence do you need to prove that it´s Chinese territory?""India asserts its boundary claim based on the 1914 McMahon line, named after the British foreign secretary of colonial India.China refuses to accept the line - it runs from the east of Bhutan across the Himalayas and puts the whole of Arunachal Pradesh on the Indian side. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Indian troops being inspected in the Ladakh region during the 1962 war with ChinaFor China, Tawang offers an entry point to Arunachal Pradesh and the rest of India´s north-east.Some experts think Beijing wants to bring Buddhist holy sites, like Tawang, under its control to cement its authority over Tibet. When the current Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, he reached Tawang first after crossing mountains by foot. There´s also suspicion among some Chinese observers that given the ethnic link between the cross-border communities, Tawang could be used to whip up any future Tibetan uprising.India and China race to build along a tense frontierChina and India face off on the roof of the worldImages ´show China structures´ on India borderChina´s claims to Arunachal Pradesh have become more assertive over the past 20 years, but it appears it´s been willing to trade.Liu Zongyi, a senior fellow at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, says Tawang was central to a deal China offered India during talks in 2006.""On the premise of recovering Tawang, China was willing to give up its claim for sovereignty over most parts of southern Tibet [Arunachal Pradesh]… in exchange for India´s recognition of China´s sovereignty and control over Aksai Chin,"" Mr Liu told the BBC.He said the offer didn´t succeed because India hadn´t been willing to give up its interests in the east, especially over Tawang, and was also not ready to make concessions on Aksai Chin - currently under Chinese control.Image source, AFPImage caption, A Chinese soldier stands guard at the poorly demarcated border, which stretches several thousand kilometresShyam Saran, India´s foreign secretary at that time, said he didn´t remember any such proposal.""We never got down to any bargaining on how much territory you are willing to give up, how much territory we are willing to trade off. That stage never came up,"" Mr Saran said.Border negotiations have continued in the years since, but made no progress. The two sides met in Beijing in February for their first in-person talks in three years.India´s official position remains maintaining the status quo until a final settlement, but Chinese observers are wary.Mr Zhou, the former PLA officer, says Indian intransigence has generated suspicion.""In China there are some people who say the Indian attitude is like - mine is mine and yours is also mine. They believe that as India is in control of the eastern sector, therefore they are trying their best to grab more land in the west in Ladakh,"" Mr Zhou said. According to Mr Liu, India has over decades adopted an ""offensive defence policy, constantly encroaching on Chinese territory across the LAC and occupying the military commanding heights in the border areas"".Image source, AFPImage caption, Indian troops near the Line of Actual Control in Tawang sectorSuch remarks mirror criticisms of China´s approach to territory that India regards as its own. ""The Chinese keep moving the goal posts or shifting their position,"" says Mr Saran.With both sides showing little flexibility, Mr Zhou thinks resolving the border dispute should be left to the future.But many in India feel a delay could only be advantageous to China, which has vastly increased its military and economic might in the last few decades.""As the power asymmetry between the two sides keeps growing, I think we should expect a much more assertive China,"" said Mr Saran.No one expects a war to break out anytime soon, given how much India and China value their strong trade relations. But neither shows any sign of compromise. As both sides vie for control on the ground, clashes like the recent one near Tawang only become more likely - all it would need is a spark for things to flare up.BBC News India is now on YouTube.

This clearly will make things even worse.""The measures will affect ""very specific technologies in the semiconductor production cycle,"" the Dutch trade minister Liesje Schreinemacher said.""The Netherlands considers it necessary on national and international security grounds that this technology is brought under control as soon as possible,"" she said in a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday.Ms Schreinemacher added that the Dutch government had considered ""the technological developments and geopolitical context,"" without naming China or ASML.Under the new rules, companies would have to apply for licences to export technology including ""the most advanced Deep Ultra Violet (DUV) immersion lithography and deposition"".ASML said in a statement that it expects the restrictions to apply to its ""most advanced immersion DUV systems"".The company added that ""based on today´s announcement, our expectation of the Dutch government´s licensing policy, and the current market situation, we do not expect these measures to have a material effect on our financial outlook.""Lithography machines use lasers to print miniscule patterns on silicon as part of the manufacturing process of microchips.Since 2019 the Dutch government has stopped ASML from selling its most advanced lithography machines to China.In October, Washington announced that it would require licences for companies exporting chips to China using US tools or software, no matter where they are made in the world.The US has been pushing the Netherlands and Japan to adopt similar restrictions.Meanwhile, South Korea´s trade ministry raised concerns over the US policy on semiconductors earlier this week.""The South Korean government will make it clear that the conditions of the Chips Act could deepen business uncertainties, violate companies´ management and technology rights as well as make the United States less attractive as an investment option,"" the ministry said.South Korea is home to major microprocessor manufacturers including the world´s biggest memory chip maker Samsung.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: How the semiconductor shortage could be a problem for youRelated TopicsCompaniesNetherlandsSemiconductorsChina-US relations",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64897794,09,03,2023

Yen is a globally recognised action star who recently drew controversy for an interview in which he called the protests a riot. The 59-year-old is best known for the Ip Man movies, a Hong Kong series based on a martial arts master which has grossed more than US$400m (£338m) at the worldwide box office. He will next appear alongside Keanu Reeves in Hollywood film John Wick 4.The petition - set up by well-known Hong Kong activist Tong Wai-hung - claims that the Academy´s invitation to Yen shows ""contempt for the people of Hong Kong"" and his presence will ""damage the image and reputation of the film industry"". It has more than 84,000 signatures.Last Thursday, Yen was named as a presenter for the 95th Academy Awards, which will take place at in Los Angeles on Sunday. It is not known which category Yen is scheduled to present in. The BBC has contacted the Academy for comment. Born in Guangzhou, China, Yen was raised in Hong Kong and moved to the US at the age of 11. He gained American citizenship, but later renounced it.In a recent interview with GQ Hype, the father of three reiterated his opposition to the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The protests were initially sparked by plans to allow extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, before growing into a wider anti-government movement. ""It wasn´t a protest, okay, it was a riot. I´m not going to be here talking about how to change how people feel about it,"" Yen said.""But my own experience, like, I was there, I have many friends who were there. I don´t want to get political. A lot of people might not be happy for what I´m saying, but I´m speaking from my own experience."" Yen also asserted that Western media outlets such as the BBC and CNN only focus on ""negative stories"" about China.Earlier this month, he participated in the Two Sessions in Beijing, the annual meetings of China´s legislature and top political advisory body, as a Hong Kong delegate. They are attended by thousands of representatives from across the country.Yen is a member of the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which has no real legislative power and draws its members from various sectors of society.

Confirmation of his third term as president had been widely expected. The naming of a new premier and various ministers in the coming days is considered more important.The new appointees are mostly expected to be Xi Jinping loyalists. This includes Li Qiang, who is tipped to serve as Mr Xi´s number two.On Friday, Mr Xi has also gained another term as the chairman of the CMC of the People´s Republic of China. There are two CMCs in the country - one is a party organisation while another is a state institution - but their make-up is usually the same. Mr Xi has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests. The country is also facing a falling birth rate that threatens its economic growth engine.Ties between Beijing and Washington remain testy, recently highlighted by allegations China had been spying on the US with balloons.""Whether a strengthened Xi and increasing centralisation is sufficient to overcome these problems - or perhaps make them worse - is unknown and perhaps not knowable at present,"" Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University Singapore, told the BBC.""In a sense, Xi is betting that centralisation under the party with him at the helm is a solution to these disparate issues,"" he said.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: Why China´s president gets two teacups...in 59 secondsThe so-called Two Sessions of the National People´s Congress and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into China´s direction in the coming years.Since Mao Zedong, leaders in China had been limited to two terms in office. When Mr Xi had this restriction changed in 2018, it transformed him into a figure with a reach not seen since Chairman Mao.Also on Friday, the national legislature appointed Han Zheng, a 68-year-old former Politburo Standing Committee member, as vice president.The importance of the position varies since its functions are not fully defined. However, the last vice president, Wang Qishan, fronted Mr Xi´s anti-corruption campaign, Chong said.Chances are that Mr Han will follow Mr Xi´s direction closely and enforce the president´s policies as necessary, he added.Related TopicsXi JinpingAsiaChina",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64911512,10,03,2023

There was applause as Mr Xi cast his vote. Mr Li - who is now the second-highest ranking official in China´s political system - received a total of 2,936 votes, with just three delegates voting against his appointment and eight abstaining.He then took an oath, swearing to be loyal to China´s constitution and to ""work hard to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilised, harmonious and great modern socialist country"".Mr Li was President Xi´s chief of staff in the early 2000s, when Mr Xi was party chief of Zhejiang province. Mr Li was made party secretary of Shanghai in 2017.During the pandemic, he oversaw Shanghai´s strict lockdown, which led to some residents struggling to access food and medical care. His appointment comes after Mr Xi secured a historic third term as president on Friday.The president has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests.

The appointed investigator will review classified reports about the 2019 and 2021 federal elections and will make recommendations for future contests.Rival political party leaders have called for a public inquiry. China has denied any election interference, calling the claims ""purely baseless and defamatory"".Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Monday, Mr Trudeau said the reports challenging Canada´s ""sovereignty"" are alarming, and ""strike us to our very core as Canadians"". ""I will be appointing an independent special rapporteur, who will have a wide mandate and make expert recommendations on combating interference and strengthening our democracy,"" Mr Trudeau said.The rapporteur has not yet been chosen, he said, adding that the appointment will be made in the coming days.Mr Trudeau also said he would ask members of parliament and senators in the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (Nsicop) to begin a review of foreign interference and to report its findings to parliament.He added that Canada has long been aware of meddling attempts by China, as well as Iran and Russia. The countries, as well as several other non-state actors, ""have attempted to interfere not only in our democracy, but our country in general"". ""This is not a new problem,"" he said.Why Trudeau is facing calls for a public inquiryA series of reports in the Globe and Mail newspaper and broadcaster Global News in recent weeks, based on leaks from Canadian intelligence sources, detailed alleged attempts by China´s Communist Party to interfere in the last two federal elections.Chinese officials have dismissed the reports as ""purely baseless and defamatory"" and as ""hype"".Conservative politicians have said publicly they were aware of interference in 2021 race, and believe it had cost them several seats - though not enough to change the election result, which Mr Trudeau´s Liberals won with a 41-seat lead.A federal public report last week found that efforts to meddle in the 2021 federal election did not affect the results. Federal opposition parties - the New Democrats and the Conservatives - have been pushing for an ""independent and public"" inquiry into the accounts.In response to Mr Trudeau´s announcement, the New Democrats criticised the Nsicop committee probe, arguing it was not an ""acceptable substitute for a public inquiry"". ""The way to stop foreign actors from acting in secret is to refuse to keep their secrets,"" said New Democrat MP Peter Julian.The leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre, called Mr Trudeau´s announcement a ""cover up"" by Liberals ""to avoid accountability"".The rapporteur will have the authority to recommend a public inquiry, Mr Trudeau said in response to critics.""We will abide by their recommendation,"" he said, calling the decision one of the official´s first tasks after being appointed. ""I know there are people out there who don´t believe this is enough,"" Mr Trudeau continued. ""I get that.

The regulations were updated following an outcry five years ago when a Chinese scientist said he had created the world´s first gene-edited babies.China says the new laws are in line with international rules.They set requirements for ethical approval, supervision and inspection, but experts worry that they may not apply to the private sector.China jails ´gene-edited babies´ scientistGene editing technique could transform futureDr Zhang,  one of the main speakers at an international human genome-editing summit in London, told BBC News: ""My biggest concern is that the new measures fail to cover a chronic and increasing problem in trying to deal with private ventures that are taking place outside of conventional scientific institutes.""The new rules may struggle to keep up with the burgeoning innovation that is happening in China.´´Gene editing is a new technique that enables scientists to make precise changes to DNA. Scientists believe it could be used to correct many inherited diseases. It is controversial, though, because it raises the possibility of making permanent changes to a person´s genetic make-up that will be passed down to their offspring. A controversial experimentThe world´s leading scientists in the field were stunned when Dr He Jiankui, from Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, claimed five years ago that he had created the world´s first gene-edited babies - twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana.The girls´ DNA had been altered while they were at an early embryonic stage in a way that Dr He claimed would make them resistant to HIV infection. He was fined and sentenced to three years in prison in 2019. No-one, other than Dr He, has had access to the twins. But at a recent scientific meeting, he said they were in good health.Upon his release, it emerged last month that he was planning to set up a clinic in Hong Kong to research using gene editing to develop a treatment for children with a rare inherited muscular disorder, called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Immigration officials announced that they had rescinded his visa after they discovered he had a criminal record.The new rules close the loopholes that enabled Dr He to evade regulations, which previously only applied to experiments on human beings in hospitals, for example for drug trials. The updated regulations cover all research institutions and everything relating to humans, including work on tissues, organs and embryonic cells.

""Permanent, inherited changes are banned, governance has adopted a precautionary approach and our laws are in line with international rules.""Image source, SPLDr Francoise Baylis, a Canadian bioethicist from Dalhousie University, said she wanted more details of the updates to China´s rules.´´I saw [that in the updated rules] research should be in line with ethical principles. I would want to know which ethical principles, where they are set out and whether they are open to questioning,´´ she said.She added that China was not alone in grappling with how to regulate the private sector.´´We have similar issues in North America, so I think it is wrong to focus on China,´´ she said.Dr Piers Millett, of the International Biosafety and Biosecurity Initiative, based in Washington, acknowledged that: ´´China is probably leading the way in revising the rules in this area.´´Image source, SEBASTIAN KAULITZKI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARYImage caption, Gene editing enables precise genetic changes to be made at the embryonic stageMany scientists have wondered how Dr He could be allowed to return to clinical research after serving time in prison. ""I, like many people, had been wondering whether there had been an individual or institution in China that had been backing or protecting He Jiankui,"" said Dr Zhang.But she said she now thought that ""we are looking at a simple case of regulatory negligence"".That led her to believe that ""without getting clarifications on Dr He´s case, the recent talk of good governance is hypocritical"".""I worry less about what He Jiankui is up to, and more about the Chinese authorities are doing,"" she said.Follow Pallab on TwitterRelated TopicsGene editingMedicineChinaTop StoriesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?Published15 hours agoUS bank taken over in biggest failure since 2008Published10 hours agoA twisted moral code explains Mexico cartel´s apologyPublished17 minutes agoFeaturesHas Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s power grid failed?How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designerSleds, swimmers and street fighting: Photos of the weekHollywood is playing catch-up with its Asian momentFlorida´s battle over how race is taught in schoolsThe Last of Us: What to expect from series twoIndian students who risk their lives to study.

China Square: The cheap Chinese shop at the centre of Kenya row - BBC News,"China Square: The cheap Chinese shop at the centre of Kenya row - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeWar in UkraineCoronavirusClimateVideoWorldUKBusinessTechScienceMoreStoriesEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsWorldAfricaAsiaAustraliaEuropeLatin AmericaMiddle EastUS & CanadaChina Square: The cheap Chinese shop at the centre of Kenya rowPublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, EPAImage caption, Protesters wanted China Square to permanently shut its doorsBy Victor KipropBBC News, NairobiA Chinese-owned shop selling cheap household goods at the centre of a dispute in Kenya has reopened after a counterfeit complaint against it was dismissed. The row got to the heart of a debate about whether this kind of outlet hurts or helps Kenyans.Blowing whistles and vuvuzelas, Kenyan petty traders marched in their hundreds to the deputy president´s office in Nairobi to demand an end to what they called a ""China invasion"".The China Square shop that had become a hit with consumers because of its cheap goods was the focus of their anger. Its rapid success had rekindled long-held fears about competition from abroad.The shop, which is in a mall on the outskirts of Nairobi, had already shut its doors, albeit temporarily, by the time of last week´s protest as controversy swirled around it.Barely five weeks into trading, it had become a social media phenomenon. Its low prices compared to what the petty traders were charging and convenient location made it very attractive.But some small-scale traders, who form a vital part of Kenya´s economy, began to notice business dropping off.""We want the Chinese out of Kenya. If the Chinese become the manufacturers, distributors, retailers and even hawkers, where will Kenyans go?"" an unnamed trader told journalists at the protest.Peter Sitati, who imports and sells beauty equipment in Nairobi, was one of those at the demonstration.He says a plastic pedicure stool that costs around $43 (£35) in his shop, retailed at China Square for about $21, effectively undercutting him by more than 50%.""Many Kenyan businesses are going to close their shops and our economy will collapse,"" Mr Sitati argued.Image source, Peter SitatiImage caption, Peter Sitati says he is not able to sell his goods at China Square´s lower pricesPressed to explain why he was charging so much more, he said he was covering the taxes and duty he was charged and thought that he might be buying the goods from China at a higher price than China Square.Despite being asked by the BBC, China Square did not explain how it set its prices, but it might be benefitting from being able to buy in bigger quantities. It may also have a more direct relationship with the manufacturers. A lot of the smaller Kenyan traders have to go through middle men and may be charged more as a result.China Square founder Lei Cheng insisted he had done nothing wrong.""My business is legal and is centred on healthy competition. We have cooperated with all government directives of opening a business in Kenya and we are here to break the monopoly,"" Mr Lei said.He added that his business took more than $157,000 in its first two weeks.""The people who are fighting us feel threatened because Kenyans now know we exist and we are not exploiting them in pricing.""´Quality goods, affordable prices´Some Kenyan shoppers are on the retailer´s side.""China Square should be allowed to operate. They´re selling quality goods at affordable prices,"" Sharon Wanjiku said.""The cost of living is very high at the moment and these prices are exactly what we need.""The swift popularity of the shop followed by the controversy caught the attention of the government, with one minister saying it should cease operating as a retailer.""We welcome Chinese investors to Kenya but as manufacturers not traders,"" Trade Minister Moses Kuria said on Twitter on the Friday before China Square shut down.It remains unclear why the shop did close its doors to customers. There were suspicions that it had been put under some pressure by the authorities.A statement from China Square said it was closing to ""re-evaluate and replan our company strategy"" and that it was ""considering a possibility of co-operating with local traders"".But at the end of last week, Kenya´s Anti-Counterfeit Authority said it had investigated a complaint that China Square was selling fake goods but had found no evidence that that was the case.On Monday, the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce (KCCC) welcomed the re-opening of China Square after discussions were held with the government, however it did not go into details of what the talks were about.""The Chamber looks forward to an equal and fair treatment of all businesses across [the] board to ensure a conducive business environment for all,"" the KCCC statement said, but it did not say if any new agreement had been made.Image source, EPAImage caption, The protest against China Square attracted a large crowdSome fear that the row over the shop has sent out the wrong message about the economy and the interest in investment.Korir SingOei, from the ministry of foreign affairs, has been seeking to reassure potential investors, saying that Kenya welcomes money from outside and does not discriminate where it comes from.Wu Peng, the top diplomat for Africa at China´s Foreign Ministry, was pleased with the clarification and said a ""non-discriminatory investment environment is vital to the healthy development of bilateral practical co-operation"".Kenya has in the past struggled to find a middle ground between attracting foreign investment and promoting free trade while protecting local traders from what some see as unfair competition.""Stopping foreigners from doing legitimate business in Kenya is retrogressive. We need to see how to build the capacity of Kenyans to be able to produce competitive products,"" says Kenyan economist Gerrishon Ikiara. DeportationsThe Kenya Investment Promotion Act, which sets conditions for foreign investors, requires an investment to be beneficial to the country through things such as new jobs, the transfer of new skills or technology, or the use of local raw materials or services.There is no data available to show how many Chinese traders or people are in Kenya, but there has been growing anti-Chinese sentiment in recent years. This has been partly due to allegations that individual Chinese people in Kenya have been racist, as well as fears of Chinese traders taking businesses and jobs from Kenyans.In 2019, the Kenyan authorities deported seven Chinese nationals who had been operating in two markets in Nairobi, accusing them of not having work permits and saying they could not operate in a sector that had been reserved for locals.In 2020, four Chinese men were deported after being accused of caning a Kenyan man working at a Chinese restaurant. President William Ruto has so far steered clear of the matter, but ahead of his election last year he promised to deport Chinese nationals engaging in business that can be done by Kenyans.""We have agreements with different countries on what level of business or work is to be done by locals and which one is allowed, where one must have [a] work permit, to foreigners. And that level is not selling in kiosks, retail or roasting maize,"" Mr Ruto said last June.China Square is clearly not working out of a kiosk, but its re-opening continues to present a challenge to the petty traders, whose complaints have not gone away.Related TopicsAfrica–China relationsKenya",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64809423,06,03,2023

""We´re ahead of the curve on this because we have to be - because we need to earn trust,"" TikTok vice-president of government relations and public policy in Europe Theo Bertram said.A similar plan, Project Texas, is under way in the US. Its back against the wall, TikTok is fighting hard to prove it is no national-security threat.Executives unveiling Project Clover repeatedly said they were going further than other major social networks to protect user privacy.And I can´t think of a time when a Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat held a press conference announcing sweeping privacy changes, with an open Q and A.But will it be enough to save the platform?Chinese telecoms giant Huawei bent over backwards to convince governments it could be trusted.It spent a fortune setting up a transparency centre in Oxfordshire, where for years UK cyber chiefs poured over source code looking for signs of Chinese government interference.None was found - but US-led theoretical concerns about spying still saw Huawei banned from the UK´s 5G networks.Project Clover aims to convince European lawmakers TikTok is safe.But history tells us TikTok´s future will remain in jeopardy unless the US is convinced - and at the moment, the US seems firmly set on taking action against the app.More than 100 million Americans use the viral-video app.But the Canadian and US governments have also restricted its use on official devices.TikTok has said such bans are ""misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security"".And China firmly opposes the action.""How unsure of itself can the world´s top superpower like the US be to fear young people´s favourite app like that?"" China foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.´Diplomatic tensions´The day before Project Clover was announced, US President Joe Biden lent his administration´s support to a bill - promoted by Democrat Mark Warner, who chairs the senate intelligence committee, and Republican John Thune - granting powers to ban foreign-owned technology.TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew will appear before congress later this month.On Tuesday, TikTok told BBC Radio 4´s World Tonight programme it feared becoming a ""pawn"" in diplomatic tensions between the US and China.""It would be hard to deny that we´re caught up in those very broad geopolitics that really have nothing to do with us,"" its US head of public policy Michael Beckerman said.""Almost all the major tech companies also have engineers in China,"" he said, and TikTok was not the only one to gather significant amounts of user data.""And so some of these concerns would extend to all these companies- but that´s why we´re building out the system to ensure that there´s no doubt that data is secure.""Related TopicsTikTokChinaEuropean UnionUnited States",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64887704,08,03,2023
