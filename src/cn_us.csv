Many in the United States think that China is not democratic. In my opinion, seeing is believing. The democracy I've seen in China is vibrant and very effective.Every year at this time, when spring flowers bloom, the ""two sessions"" -- China´s important annual political gatherings -- are held in Beijing, and this year was no exception.In Western countries such as the United States, where democracy and elections are essentially equated, people elect someone and hope for the best. In China, democracy is more than elections. The ""two sessions"" have been a window to showcase the strength and vitality of China´s democracy. Last year before the ""two sessions,"" my colleagues and I had the opportunity to visit a Shanghai community, which gave me a sense of how China´s whole-process people´s democracy works on a daily basis.In Shanghai´s Hongqiao subdistrict, we interviewed Noyan Rona, a Turkish banker and an enthusiastic volunteer. Rona told us that, when approached about a draft revision to the individual income tax law in 2018, he suggested adding the word ""accumulated"" before the individual tax residency threshold of 183 days in a tax year to make the rule more explicit.Rona recalled this story from several years ago with renewed excitement. His suggestion was adopted and written into law, which would influence a lot of foreigners living in China, he proudly told us.I was very curious to know that, for residents like Rona who are keen to offer opinions, in what ways can they have their opinions heard by lawmakers? At a civic center in Hongqiao, we saw a type of red mailbox designed to collect letters of opinion from residents.In fact, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People´s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee set up a community-level contact station at the civic center. The red mailboxes are part of their facility. Draft laws are sent down here so that ordinary citizens can discuss them and have their opinions heard. In other words, the voices of grassroots people will reach the highest legislative body.Since the establishment of the contact station in 2015, 78 draft laws, including the Foreign Investment Law, have been discussed here by residents in Hongqiao and 163 pieces of advice incorporated, including Rona´s suggestion about individual income tax law.I learned from this year´s ""two sessions"" that similar community-level contact stations have been set up across the nation, becoming the ""through train"" for the grassroots voices to reach the national legislature. What I didn't know was that as a foreigner living in China, I also have such rights.Of course, the channels themselves do not guarantee full participation. There is an important role to play for representatives of public opinion at the grassroots. They are the 2.77 million deputies to people´s congresses at all levels nationwide.Deputies would visit organizations and individuals that can vote, hear and collect public opinions, and conduct research for the proposals and suggestions they submit. They would also participate in research trips, seminars, dialogues, and open-day events to talk about issues of public concern. In addition, they would receive training from time to time to enhance their ability to perform their duties.The practice in Hongqiao is very successful. In November 2019, President Xi Jinping visited the civic center while a consultation meeting on a draft law was underway. Xi talked to both the Chinese and foreign residents attending the meeting, and for the first time made the remark that ""People´s democracy is a type of whole-process democracy.""Compared with legislators in the West who make politics their career and usually have a staff and campaign team, NPC deputies come from all walks of life and all 56 ethnic groups in China. Most of them are part-timers, who work and live among their people and therefore understand their needs best.In an interview with Xinhua, Rick Dunham, a U.S. visiting professor at Tsinghua University, pointed out that in the United States, there are more lawyers, doctors, and top managers involved in politics. In China, one finds more grassroots representation including blue-collar workers, farmers and takeaway riders. I would agree with his conclusion that China´s NPC deputies are more representative than U.S. lawmakers.From protecting workers' rights in the food-delivery and car-hailing industries to alleviating the pressure of excessive schoolwork and off-campus tutoring; from solving the financing difficulties of SMEs to protecting the ecology of the Yellow River... Deputies and political advisors collect and sort out the opinions of ordinary people, which often form the basis of their proposals and suggestions. Some of these ideas will be incorporated into relevant laws, regulations, systems, policies, decisions and arrangements.Over the past five years, as I was told, some 18,000 pieces of advice from national lawmakers and political advisors have been adopted by relevant departments of the Chinese central government and over 7,800 policy measures have subsequently been introduced. As a result, many problems have been addressed related to the country´s reform and development and the people´s most urgent needs.In a nutshell, China´s democracy is a whole process that can involve all people. To let the people discuss the affairs of their own and to make sure that the people are in charge are the essence of the ""whole-process people´s democracy.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219808.html,10,3,2023

""Mr. President: Washington has a spending problem, NOT a revenue problem.""Under Biden´s budget proposal, the Pentagon´s spending would surge to 842 billion dollars in fiscal 2024, a 26-billion-dollar or 3.2-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level.The United States has been heavily criticized for hefty spending on military activities. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2023 allocated nearly 817 billion dollars to the Pentagon.Andrew Lautz, director of federal policy for the National Taxpayers Union and National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF), wrote on Thursday that the NTUF is skeptical of the 2024 Biden defense budget request, and believes that ""all taxpayers should be too.""Hundreds of Americans attended a rally in Washington, D.C. last month to protest against massive money funneling into Ukraine, as well as the role of the United States in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.""The United States is playing way too much on the military,"" Scholz-Karabakakis, a protester from Vermont, said, while he accused Washington of ""expanding outwards to the borders"" of other countries and ""creating anxiety, fear around the world.""",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219933.html,10,3,2023

(Xinhua/Liu Jie)Today, most Black adults say the U.S. economic system does not treat Black people fairly.NEW YORK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Black Americans have long had significantly lower wages and household wealth than White Americans, and the roots of these inequities trace back to the central role slave labor once played in the nation´s economic system and the subsequent segregation and discrimination in labor markets, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys.In an August 2022 survey, 54 percent of Black adults said they had a very or somewhat negative impression of capitalism, up from 40 percent in May 2019.

Human rights protection is a pretense of the U.S., which covers a ""black hole"" of the human rights situation in the U.S.The U.S. Department of Labor announced that it found that Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI), one of the nation’s largest food safety sanitation services providers, employed over 100 children in hazardous occupations, and had them working overnight shifts at meat processing facilities. The minors were working with hazardous chemicals and cleaning meat processing equipment, and suffered injuries while working for PSSI.Child labor is a chronic illness of U.S. society. The country has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child yet, and has been criticized by the International Labor Organization many times. The Guardian reported that child labor law violations have increased in the U.S., with a 37 percent increase in fiscal year 2022, including 688 children working in hazardous conditions. Estimates by the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs suggest that there are 500,000 to 800,000 child farmworkers in the U.S. These facts are a sharp reminder that the U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, can hardly protect the legitimate rights of children. ",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10220276.html,10,3,2023
7,Commentary: The post-shame era of U.S. foreign policy - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: The post-shame era of U.S. foreign policy (Xinhua) 13:05, March 04, 2023BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Ethics Committee on Thursday launched an investigation against Congressman George Santos, who has been found to have fabricated major elements of his life story and even lied about his mother´s death in the 9/11 attacks.Not known for aggressively pursuing inquiries, the committee has limited ability to punish lawmakers for wrongdoing. In February, Santos told CNN that he is ""not concerned"" about a House ethics probe. And despite his scandals, Republicans seem reluctant to push for Santos' immediate removal from office.The National Public Radio (NPR) recently lamented that surviving scandals has become easier for politicians like Santos, as the United States has entered an era of ""post-shame politics."" But NPR is a bit slow on the uptake. For people outside the United States, the post-shame era began long ago, particularly in regards to U.S. foreign policy.In his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Samuel P. Huntington noted that the belief in American principles as universal and the U.S. mission to promote and defend these principles throughout the world has been a persistent and potent theme in American foreign policy. However, this theme has become intermittent and weaker as the United States pursues its interests with no sense of shame and a willingness to flout its own principles and values.The ""America First"" policy embodies how times have changed. Championed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, the approach prioritizes U.S. interests over those of other countries. It disregards established international norms, which many have criticized as selfish and isolationist.Sadly, the lack of shame in American foreign policy has persisted beyond Trump´s presidency, as seen in continued U.S. drone strikes, the hasty Afghanistan withdrawal, the theft of Syria oil and its long-arm jurisdiction, to name just a few.The U.S. military´s drone strikes in Somalia and Yemen, among other countries, have been controversial due to their often deadly impact on innocent civilians. Despite the U.S. government´s claims to uphold human rights and the rule of law, the drone strikes have resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of non-combatant deaths. Moreover, the legality of these strikes has been widely questioned, particularly as they were often carried out in countries where the United States was not officially at war and was without the consent of those nations.Since 2001, the U.S. military has conducted several operations in the name of fighting terrorism, resulting in the deaths of over 900,000 individuals, approximately 335,000 of them civilians. These horrific U.S. military campaigns have created 37 million refugees worldwide, with an estimated 48,000 civilians having died due to U.S. airstrikes over the past two decades.A lack of shame was also evident during the abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan, ignoring the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity it had championed. Relying heavily on NATO partners during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the U.S. government suddenly pulled out of the country without sufficient consultation with its allies, leaving them in a complex and precarious position, its allies complained.The U.S. military´s exploitation of Syrian oil resources is another prime example of how America lacks shame. Despite violating international law, the United States and its mercenaries have been accused of extracting an average of 66,000 barrels of oil per day from Syrian oil fields. Such acts of theft have damaged the United States' moral authority and undermined its credibility as a global superpower.Its long-arm jurisdiction also exemplifies a sense of shamelessness. The United States typically enforces its laws on foreign individuals and entities outside its territory, disregarding the sovereignty of other nations. This behavior has been illustrated in cases involving French company Alstom and Chinese company Huawei. In both cases, the United States used its legal and economic prowess to bully others into submission and maintain dominance in key industries while containing rising competitors.The implications of a ""post-shame era"" in U.S. foreign policy extend far beyond the country´s borders. People worldwide associate such shame with the entire nation.To rebuild its reputation, the United States must prioritize collaboration with other countries rather than continue to pursue unilateralism and hegemony. Only then can it play a more constructive and positive role in shaping a safer and more prosperous world.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10216003.html,04,3,2023

""In order for the current mine plan to go forward, the mining claims will need to be validated. This seems unlikely since millions of tons of waste is to be put on these areas indefinitely,"" he told Xinhua.The proposed lithium clay mining development project, one of the largest in the world, is located in Humboldt County, about 25 miles from the Nevada-Oregon border.Lithium Americas received a permit from the Bureau of Land Management to develop the mine in January 2021. Soon after the permit was issued, several lawsuits were filed in federal court seeking to slow or halt the project.The lawsuits claimed that the land is sacred ground for American Indians and argued that the project will damage the local environment.""This monstrous mine will permanently obliterate sagebrush winter habitat and a movement corridor that is at the heart of sage-grouse, mule deer and pronghorn survival in the high desert environment of the Montana Mountains,"" said Katie Fite, Public Lands director at WildLands Defense.Sage-grouse will soon begin their elaborate mating displays. The birds will be driven off lek display grounds and nesting sites by the hellish noise and construction disturbance of an open pit mine, she said.The Bureau of Land Management´s approval of Thacker Pass mining ""exposes how hollow and false its claims of sage-grouse conservation really are,"" Fite said.Hadder noted that the current rulings should not be a justification for fast-tracking permitting of mines even for energy transition minerals.""We must not relax our standards and analysis or we are likely to end up with more toxic mine sites across the U.S. that could be a source of long term pollution and drive climate change,"" he told Xinhua.""Modern mining is very environmentally destruction and often disruptive to communities, so it needs to be carefully and judicially, which not what has happened at Thacker Pass,"" Hadder said.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10215941.html,04,3,2023

However, the US has in recent years invested heavily to upgrade its nuclear triad, heightened the role of nuclear weapons in its national security policy and built up a network of military alliance around the globe. The United States has also built small blocs reminiscent of the Cold War by bolstering extended deterrence and conducting nuclear submarine cooperation, according to the spokesperson.""It is the United States who is the primary source of nuclear threat in the world. The US should fully reflect on its nuclear policy, step up to its special and primary responsibilities of nuclear disarmament, and reduce the role of nuclear weapons in national security policy,"" Mao said.She called on the United States to take meaningful, practical steps to reduce nuclear risks and act responsibly to maintain the strategic stability of regional and global peace and security.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10215987.html,04,3,2023

14,Commentary: U.S. slander against China's stance on Ukraine crisis absurd - People's Daily Online,"Commentary: U.S. slander against China´s stance on Ukraine crisis absurd (Xinhua) 12:37, March 04, 2023BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Committed to promoting peace talks on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China has recently released a paper stating Beijing´s position on the crisis. While the fair and constructive document has been widely welcomed across the world, some Western countries led by the United States have smeared the proposal as ""unfair.""Labeling China´s support for peace talks as ""unreasonable,"" Washington is suggesting that the only right stance on the issue is to stand by the United States to keep fueling the crisis. What an absurdity.The root cause of Washington' slander against China´s position is that the United States does not want an early end to the conflict. ""Behind a mind-set that invites the burden of policing a rules-based global order is a conventional assumption: War, though tragic, is a boon for economic vitality and patriotic vigor,"" said an opinion piece titled ""Straight Talk on the Country´s War Addiction"" published last month by The New York Times.That is the case. From reaping arms orders to replacing Russia in energy supply to Europe, the United States has indeed energized its economy through the conflict. What´s more, by waging ""a proxy war"" to weaken Russia and forcing Europe to further rely on America in security, the United States has consolidated its hegemony.Besides, discrediting China is Washington´s old trick to contain the country. Since the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, certain U.S. and Western politicians, together with some media outlets, have spread disinformation about China, saying ""China may provide weapons to Russia.""In this way, the United States is attempting to shift the blame for fanning the flames in Ukraine. As most countries in the world hope for peace, the United States is eager to shy away from its responsibility and divert the public´s attention from the truth that it is Washington that is aggravating tensions.Meanwhile, using the Ukraine crisis as an excuse, Washington has pointed the finger at China-Russia ties, depicting the relationship as a threat. In fact, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination is built on the basis of non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third countries, which is within the sovereign right of any two independent states. The relationship tolerates no third party interference or coercion.The U.S. rhetoric has exposed the mindset of confrontation long held by the United States and its Western allies when dealing with international disputes. From the failure in Iraq to the hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, American politicians should have given up their obsession with military force and power politics.At the recent Munich Security Conference, the United States and some other countries from the Western world tried to continue fueling the crisis, while some leaders of developing countries believed that the ongoing conflict delayed the resolution of other pressing issues.""We don't want to go on discussing who will be the winner or the loser of a war,"" said Colombia´s Vice President Francia Marquez. ""We are all losers and, in the end, it is humankind that loses everything.""Washington must be aware that its stance on the Ukraine crisis goes against the will of the international community. Stop the blame game, and do something that really helps cool the situation.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0304/c90000-10215988.html,04,3,2023

The parliament has failed for 11 times over the past six months to elect a new president for lack of consensus among political parties.Political gridlock has slowed down the efforts to implement structural reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a bailout loan amounting to 3 billion U.S. dollars which could lead the country back to recovery.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0310/c90000-10219946.html,10,3,2023

Today, it plans and conducts operations to maintain a unipolar world order. Our experiences are manifestations of this,"" said Erturk, who served as commander of the Turkish Naval Academy between 2008 and 2010.He said the Ukraine crisis is an excellent example of U.S. efforts to maintain its political hegemony, blaming Washington for consciously prolonging the conflict.""The U.S. had invested much in this crisis to get Ukraine away from Russia,"" said Erturk.The conflict ""might not have started and could have been prevented,"" but the United States ""didn't want to prevent it,"" said Erturk, adding that the United States could end the conflict tomorrow if it wanted.According to Erturk, the United States forbids any country to challenge its hegemony, intending to destroy all nation-states that can potentially jeopardize a unipolar order, and Russia was among them.""Especially since the beginning of the 2000s, the United States aspires to reduce the number of nation-states even more by exploiting ethnic, religious and sectarian fault lines,"" Erturk said.""So you know what this means?

[Photo by Zhai Huiyong/For China Daily]China is a market foreign enterprises must go to, and the country will further strengthen efforts to retain and attract more high-quality foreign investment, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said on Thursday.He made the remarks at a news conference in Beijing to expound China´s stance on promoting foreign investment.Attracting and utilizing more foreign investment will be ""a key task"" this year, Wang said, adding that the country will make greater efforts to promote investment, improve services, expand opening-up and optimize the business environment, in order to retain high-quality foreign investment and attract more foreign investors.""We will thoroughly implement the foreign investment law and its implementation regulations to apply national treatment to foreign enterprises with high standards,"" he said.""Issues many foreign enterprises raise, such as those regarding government procurement, bidding and standards formulation, will be key focuses of our work,"" he added.Wang said the ministry and other central government departments will conduct research and roll out policy measures to ensure foreign enterprises have equal access to those opportunities.Cross-department complaint and coordination mechanisms at all government levels will also be established and improved to strengthen the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors.The ministry will also initiate a ""Year of Investing in China"" program, which will include a series of foreign investment promotional events and activities at home and abroad.Wang said the ministry will enhance services for foreign investors including holding regular consultations and discussions with foreign enterprises and business chambers to help them solve problems.Huo Jianguo, vice-chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, said China faces serious challenges in attracting foreign direct investment this year against the backdrop of a gloomy global economy and the probable intensifying of the United States' moves to contain China.To cope with the challenge, China is expected to further optimize the business environment, enhance policy consistency, firmly safeguard the legitimate interests of all enterprises and proactively expand opening-up in the services industry, Huo said.China is also likely to enhance implementation of the negative lists system and the catalog of industries encouraging foreign investment, while further expanding market access to high-tech industries, he added.On the back of China´s steady economic rebound and firm commitment to opening-up, many multinational companies have shown strong confidence in China.Mauro De Felip, general manager of Ferrero China, said a company cannot call itself a multinational if it is not successful in Asia.

19,Why China's position paper on Ukraine crisis annoyed some countries? - People's Daily Online,"Why China´s position paper on Ukraine crisis annoyed some countries? (Xinhua) 13:31, March 03, 2023BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- To push forward the political settlement of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Chinese Foreign Ministry released last month a paper stating Beijing´s position on the issue.In the paper, China put forward a 12-point proposal to end the conflict in Ukraine by addressing both the symptoms and the root causes of the crisis, and reiterated the necessity to end the conflict through dialogue and negotiation.The peace proposal, since being offered, has been welcomed by many countries of the international community. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, hailed the position paper as ""an important contribution.""Yet some Western politicians turned a cold shoulder to the proposal, accusing China of being biased and dismissed the contents of the document as nothing new.These claims have been refuted by experts and scholars in many countries, who believe the proposal demonstrated China´s commitment to objectivity and fairness as well as its role as a responsible major country in times of grave global challenges.They argued that in the ever worsening conflict, it is the United States and its NATO allies that cling to the Cold War mentality and have kept on fueling the crisis for their own benefits.CHINA'S UKRAINE PEACE PROPOSAL IMPARTIAL AND VIABLEAli El-Hefny, secretary general of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, also a former Egyptian ambassador to China, said the Chinese paper reflects a policy and a clear vision on international relations that China has always adopted.It´s a respectful and responsible position of a country with a big presence in the international arena, whether economically or politically, he said.The paper is built on the necessity of giving up everything provocative, avoiding imposing sanctions and stopping providing Ukraine with all types of arms, which would in the end expand and prolong the war, the secretary general said.Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, said that on the first anniversary of the escalation of the crisis, China released the document expounding its position on the issue, hoping to promote an early resolution of the crisis through peaceful dialogue.China´s stance is in line with the universal expectations of peace-loving people around the world, he said.Some Western countries have consistently failed to play a constructive role in easing the tensions of the Ukraine crisis. Instead, they have continuously imposed sanctions on Russia while arming Ukraine, fueling the crisis, Rawashdeh said.The motive is to weaken Russia and Ukraine and to benefit from the conflict. This is a typical Cold War mentality, and the real victims are the people of the two countries, who have suffered from the trauma of the crisis, he said.The high inflation and food shortages resulting from the Ukraine conflict continue to bite. The world will become more turbulent and unstable if the West keeps instigating, he added.Richard Grenell, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, noted in an article on news website California Globe that China offered ""a conceivable starting point"" to end the conflict whereas ""veteran State Department employees were furious that a year has gone by without a U.S. plan for a peaceful solution.""The White House is thinking ""morning, noon, and night"" about how to give Ukraine more military aid, he wrote.To date, the United States has provided many rounds of aid to Ukraine and allied nations, totaling some 113 billion U.S. dollars. Washington and its allies have already committed nearly 700 tanks and thousands of armored vehicles and 1,000 artillery systems, among other aid to Ukraine.Xulio Rios, director of the Observatory of Chinese Politics in Spain, said it seems that Western countries are more interested in maintaining the conflict than pushing for a ceasefire and opening negotiations for a political solution.Meanwhile, China´s approach allows the world to see a viable solution and that will be supported by countries valuing common good for the whole world, he added.WESTERN HEGEMONIC SCHEME KNOWN TO ALLFor many observers, the reasons why politicians in some Western countries felt displeased with China´s peace proposal are quite obvious.Lewis Ndichu, a researcher at Nairobi-based think tank Africa Policy Institute, said The West has been used to realizing ""peace"" through intervening by providing warfare equipment, intelligence and sending air combat forces, all these will lead to a devastating arms race.Seeing China playing an increasingly greater role on the world stage, the West is not happy, said Ndichu.Ang Teck Sin, a political commentator in Singapore, told Xinhua that both Russia and Ukraine suffered heavy casualties and economic losses, but Uncle Sam, who pursues hegemonism and power politics, has seen a rare opportunity to continue to lead NATO and further intensify bloc confrontation.Washington is actually expanding business for the military-industrial complex, he said. The more volatile the world is and the larger the market will be, and the more resources the military-industrial complex will get to develop more sophisticated weapons, thus creating more conflicts, he noted.This is a terrible vicious circle. Unfortunately, it is the world that pays for America´s ambitions, the commentator said.When the United States and its allies are arming Ukraine to the teeth, it is countries like China that have to come forward to remind all as to what is at stake, said Rabia Akhtar, director of the Center for Security, Strategy and Policy Research at the University of Lahore in Pakistan.Filipe Porto, a researcher at the Brazilian Foreign Policy Observatory, said the attitude of the United States toward China on the Ukrainian issue is self-contradictory. On the one hand, the United States and its allies question and attack China´s relations with Russia, on the other they ask China to use that relationship to play the role they expect in the crisis.Slovenian sociologist Tomaz Mastnak said the Russia-Ukraine conflict had been provoked, instigated and prolonged by the United States. At least in the short term, the United States is the only country that has benefited from this conflict.The impact of the conflict on Europe is disastrous. The European economy is being dealt a heavy blow to, and first and foremost, Germany, the European economic engine, is facing ""deindustrialization,"" Mastnak said.In his opinion, this situation in Europe is not collateral damage caused by conflict, but one of the goals of the conflict provoked by the United States. It is going to make Europe economically insignificant.CHINA'S POSITION WIDELY ACCLAIMEDAs the world is facing such a prolonged conflict as well as overlapping food and energy crises, China´s proposal, which insists on promoting peace talks, has been widely applauded.China´s recent initiative to solve the Ukraine crisis politically is very timely and quite helpful, and it is completely in accordance with the UN rules, said Mohammad Reza Manafi, editor-in-chief for the Asia-Pacific news desk of Iran´s official news agency IRNA.Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Indonesian think tank Asian Innovation Research Center, said the position paper is constructive, necessary and timely.British political commentator Carlos Martinez said China´s position paper is a powerful contribution to the project of building peace in Europe. While not taking sides, it highlights the crucial elements required for the Ukraine crisis to be brought to a conclusion.The position paper is closely related to The Global Security Initiative Concept Paper released by China on Feb. 21, as both papers are firmly grounded in international law and the principles of the UN Charter. Both reflect a profound desire for peace and global prosperity; for a community with a shared future for mankind, he said.Both papers reflect a clear understanding that peace and prosperity require a reorientation of international relations toward multilateralism, cooperation, non-interference, respect for sovereignty and respect for diversity; that hegemonism and Cold War mentality are driving humanity toward a very dangerous future, Martinez emphasized.Christine Bierre, editor-in-chief of French newspaper New Solidarity, said China´s Global Security Initiative allows people to get to the root causes of the great turmoil and conflicts in the world.China´s Global Security Initiative and its position paper can have a very positive role in the Ukrainian conflict, he added.",http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2023/0303/c90000-10215667.html,03,3,2023
