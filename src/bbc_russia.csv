The eastern city has seen months of intense fighting, as Wagner and regular Russian troops try to seize it. But Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin says his army´s lack of ammunition could be ""ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal"".Ukraine´s president and military commanders have agreed to strengthen their defence of Bakhmut. Russia has appeared determined to capture the city for months, but many analysts say it has become a symbolic prize in the war and has little strategic value.An apparent rivalry between the mercenaries and the regular Russian army seems to have intensified in recent weeks, and this is not the first time Mr Prigozhin has accused the Russian defence ministry of withholding the ammunition it needs. In a social media post on Sunday, Mr Prigozhin said documents had been signed on 22 February, with ammunition expected to be sent to Bakhmut the next day.But most had not been shipped, he said, before suggesting it could be deliberate.And in a further sign of the rift, on Monday Mr Prigozhin said his representative was unable to access the headquarters of Russia´s military command. It is unclear where the headquarters is located. Mr Prigozhin said it came after he wrote to the chief of Russia´s ""special military operation"", Valery Gerasimov, about the ""urgent necessity to give us ammunition"".Separately, in a video uploaded on Saturday - but seemingly filmed in February - Mr Prigozhin said his men feared that they were being ""set up"" as scapegoats in case Russia lost its war in Ukraine. ""If we step back, we will go down in history as the people who took the main step to lose the war,"" he said.""And this is precisely the problem with the shell hunger [ammunition shortage]. This is not my opinion, but that of ordinary fighters... ""What if they [the Russian authorities] want to set us up, saying that we are scoundrels - and that´s why they are not giving us ammunition, not giving us weapons, and not letting us replenish our personnel, including [recruiting] prisoners?""In Saturday´s video, Mr Prigozhin also said Russia´s front line would collapse without his troops.He suggested Wagner fighters were taking on the ""entire Ukrainian army... destroying it"" and depriving it of the chance to concentrate on other parts of the front.What is Russia´s Wagner Group of mercenaries in Ukraine?Ukraine´s troops were probably conducting a ""limited fighting withdrawal"" in eastern Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Monday. But it added Ukraine was ""continuing to inflict high casualties"" on Russian forces.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country´s military commanders supported continuing operations to defend and strengthen positions in Bakhmut. In a statement, President Zelensky´s office said he had held a meeting with Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine´s armed forces, and Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the country´s ground forces.They spoke ""in favour of continuing the defensive operation and further strengthening our positions in Bakhmut"". On Saturday, the deputy mayor of Bakhmut told the BBC that there was street fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.However Oleksandr Marchenko said Russian troops had not yet gained control.""They have no goal to save the city... their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.Separately, Moscow´s Mr Shoigu has visited the occupied city of Mariupol during a trip to eastern Ukraine - a year after his troops besieged the city. The defence ministry said he was inspecting work carried out to ""restore infrastructure in the Donbas"" - words that are likely to grate in Ukraine, given Russia´s responsibility for the destruction.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warUkraine",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64859780,6,3,2023

""How can this be allowed to happen... One day our luck will run out,"" said Rafael Grossi. Fighting rages around Bakhmut in the eastUkrainian forces are holding on in the eastern city of Bakhmut, under intense pressure from regular Russian troops and Wagner group mercenaries fighting on the Russian side.On Wednesday, the Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said that his forces had captured all of eastern Bakhmut.The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that the claim was ""consistent with available visual evidence"".Why Bakmut matters for Russia and UkraineHas Putin´s war failed?Many military analysts say the city is of limited strategic significance. ""Russian forces remain unlikely to rapidly exploit a breakthrough beyond Bakhmut if Russian forces capture the city,"" says the ISW. The UK Ministry of Defence noted in December that capturing the city ""would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk"".Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.The fighting is part of a Russian spring offensive, which many analysts say is now under way.Michael Kofman, of the US-based Center for Naval Analysis, says that, so far, Russia´s gains have been ""underwhelming"".But, he adds, Ukraine may struggle to find weaknesses in Russia´s defences to mount a counter-attack, as Russian troop positions have been heavily reinforced. Front lines in the south stableIn the south of the country, artillery strikes continue around Kherson.Russian troops withdrew to the left bank, or eastern side, of the Dnipro River in November. Strikes by Ukrainian forces equipped with US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launchers had made Russian positions unsustainable.On Wednesday, Ukraine said its forces had destroyed a Russian ammunition depot to the west of Kherson.But many analysts assess that the front lines around the city are unlikely to change in the short term as Russia has built strong defences for its troops and equipment in the area.More than a year of fightingRussia´s invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022. Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine. They had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv, and controlled much of the north-east of the country around Sumy. Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol. But, they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.More Western arms followed and by October the picture had changed dramatically - having failed to take Kyiv, Russia had withdrawn completely from the north. Ukraine had its first major success, pushing Russia back from Kharkiv, and counter-attacking around Kherson.One year since the invasion, Ukraine is in control of Kherson and largely containing, for now, the Russian advance in the east.By David Brown, Bella Hurrell, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Lucy Rodgers, Paul Sargeant, Alison Trowsdale, Tural Ahmedzade, Mark Bryson, Zoe Bartholomew, Sean Willmott, Sana Dionysiou, Joy Roxas, Gerry Fletcher, Jana Tauschinsk, Debie Loizou, Simon Martin and Prina Shah.About these mapsTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute´s Critical Threats Project.

The state-run gas monopoly Gazprom still supplies a large share of Europe´s needs.Vladimir Putin - Russia´s dominant political figure since 2000 - has enhanced his control over state institutions and the media - a process supplemented more recently by an emphasis on fierce nationalism and hostility to the West.This led to his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in an attempt to re-assert Russian control over the neighbouring country.

""It was like never before.""President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia´s investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.How risky is stand-off over Ukraine´s nuclear plant?Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaNuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.Electricity is needed for cooling radioactive material present at the plant. ""Today´s loss of all external power once again demonstrated how fragile and dangerous the situation is for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,"" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Earlier on Thursday he had called for an international commitment to protect the plant, following a series of strikes since the invasion began.""Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,"" Mr Grossi said.In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts.A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.Elsewhere, Ukraine´s military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.""The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,"" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. ""Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.""Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say.

While there has been some targeting of power facilities in recent weeks, this has been the longest gap since the attacks began in early October. A much-anticipated wave of strikes to mark the first anniversary of Russia´s full scale invasion on 24 February failed to materialise - though this probably said more about media expectations than Russia´s actual strategy. But the increasingly sporadic nature of Russia´s infrastructure attacks is notable.Western officials believe this indicates a shortage of the kind of precision-guided weaponry - especially missiles - needed to carry out such attacks with any measure of effectiveness. ""It takes them that long to get a number of precision weapons together before they can mount a packaged event strike,"" was how one official put it earlier this week. Ukraine´s military has also become quite adept at intercepting incoming missiles and drones.Preliminary data suggests that a significant proportion of the weapons used today were shot down, including more than 70% of the cruise missiles and half the drones. According to Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, another eight missiles were thwarted by what he described as ""organized countermeasures"".But clearly, judging by reports from all over the country, others found their mark. Image source, EPAImage caption, Locals gather around a shelling crater after a rocket hit the Pisochyn neighbourhood outside KharkivSome weapons, like the long range Kh-22 anti-ship missile, which dives steeply onto its target from an extremely high altitude, are hard to intercept. The same goes for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile, which was never designed to attack targets on the ground but which has been increasingly used in this role over the course of the past six months. Military analysts will pore over the latest data, looking for what Russia´s choice of weapons indicates about Moscow´s tactics and remaining stocks. Before today´s attacks, observers had begun to wonder whether Russia would persist with a strategy that doesn´t appear to be working.Ukraine in maps: Russia launches new missile attacksUkraine nuclear plant loses power after strikesDespite the enormous damage inflicted on Ukraine´s power grid over the past six months, the country has not been brought to its knees and most Ukrainians have long since become accustomed to power cuts, inconvenience and the occasional danger.  Ukraine´s engineers have successfully kept power flowing across the country, despite losing scores of transformers, switches and other key components of the country´s infrastructure.In Kyiv and other cities, street lights have recently been switched back on, offering relief to pedestrians used to making their way along darkened pavements with only their mobile phones to light the way.But the situation remains precarious and officials know that Russia is still able to cause immense damage.

According to its deputy mayor, Oleksandr Marchenko, there are just a few thousand civilians left living in underground shelters with no water, gas or power. ""The city is almost destroyed,"" he told the BBC. ""There is not a single building that has remained untouched in this war.""So why are Russia and Ukraine fighting so hard over this pile of rubble? Why are both sides laying down the lives of so many of soldiers to attack and defend this city in a battle that has lasted longer than any other in this war? Military analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value. It is not a garrison town or a transport hub or a major centre of population. Before the invasion, there were about 70,000 people living there. The city was best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery. It holds no particular geographic importance. As one Western official put it, Bakhmut is ""one small tactical event on a 1,200-kilometre front line"". And yet Russia is deploying huge military resources into taking the city. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ukraine has suffered many casualties - such as this soldier being buried in Lviv - in its defence of BakhmutThe Kremlin needs a victory, however symbolic. It has been a long time since the summer when Russian forces seized cities like Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Since then what territorial gains they have made have been incremental and slow. So Russia needs a success to sell to pro-Kremlin propagandists back home. Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre, told the BBC: ""They are fighting a political mission, not a purely military one. Russians will continue to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve their political goals.""Russian commanders also want to take Bakhmut for military reasons. They hope it might give them a springboard for further territorial gains. As the UK Ministry of Defence noted in December, capturing the city ""would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk"". And then there is question of the Wagner mercenary group that is at the heart of the assault. Its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. He hoped to show his fighters could do better than the regular Russian army. He has recruited thousands of convicts and is throwing waves of them at Ukrainian defences, many to their deaths. If he cannot succeed here, then his political influence in Moscow will diminish. Mr Prigozhin is at odds with Russia´s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, criticising his tactics and now complaining about not getting enough ammunition. There is, Mr Kuzan said, a political struggle between both men for influence in the Kremlin ""and the place for this struggle is in Bakhmut and its surroundings"". Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Few civilians remain in Bakhmut, which was once home to about 70,000 peopleSo why has Ukraine been defending Bakhmut so doggedly, losing thousands of troops in the process? The main strategic purpose is to use the battle to weaken Russia´s army. One Western official put it bluntly: ""Bakhmut, because of the Russian tactics, is giving Ukraine a unique opportunity to kill a lot of Russians."" Nato sources estimate five Russians are dying for every one Ukrainian in Bakhmut. Ukraine´s national security secretary, Oleksiy Danilov, says the ratio is even higher at seven to one. These numbers are impossible to verify. Serhii Kuzan told the BBC: ""As long as Bakhmut fulfils its function, allowing us to grind down the enemy´s forces, to destroy much more of them proportionately than the enemy inflicts losses on us, until then we will of course keep on holding Bakhmut."" By defending the city, Ukraine also ties up Russian forces that could be deployed elsewhere on the front line. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made the city an emblem of resistance. When he visited Washington in December, he called it ""the fortress of our morale"" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress. ""The fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and for freedom,"" he said.

Ukraine would suffer a political, symbolic loss. No longer would Ukrainians be able to cry ""Bakhmut holds!"" on social media. But few believe there would be a huge military impact. The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""The fall of Bakhmut won´t necessarily mean that the Russians have changed the tide of this fight."" Mick Ryan, a strategist and former Australian general, believes there would be no fast Russian advance: ""The Ukrainians… will be withdrawing into defensive zones in the Kramatorsk areas that they have had eight years to prepare. And the city sits on higher, more defensible ground than Bakhmut. Any advance on the Kramatorsk region is likely to be every bit as bloody for the Russians as its campaign for Bakhmut."" So perhaps what matters most in the battle for Bakhmut are how many losses each side has incurred and what that might mean for the next phase in this war. Will Russia have suffered so many casualties that its capacity to mount further offensives will have been weakened? Or will Ukraine have lost so many soldiers that its army would be less able to launch a counter-offensive later in the spring?
